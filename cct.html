  <font color="black"><strong>New York (<a href="http://eni.ch/">ENI</a>).</strong> After nearly five years 
  of discussions and planning, a new grouping of the major Christian traditions 
  in the United States, including Roman Catholics as well as Evangelical and 
  Pentecostal denominations, has been formally launched. </font></font></p>
  <p><font color="black">Christian Churches Together in the USA (CCT), calling 
  itself &quot;the most inclusive fellowship of Christian churches and traditions&quot; in 
  the United States, was inaugurated on 28 March. It marks the first time that 
  bodies representing the five major Christian traditions in the United States - 
  Evangelical and Pentecostal, Protestant, predominately racial/ethnic churches, 
  Orthodox, and Roman Catholic - have come together at a national level, though 
  such churches often work together at local levels. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">&quot;We finally found the courage to confront our obvious 
  and longstanding divisions and to build a new expression of unity, rooted in 
  the Spirit, that will strengthen our mission in the world,&quot; the Rev. Wesley 
  Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary of the Reformed Church in America and 
  interim CCT moderator, said in a statement. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">The creation of CCT is the first time that the US 
  Conference of Catholic Bishops has joined such a church grouping. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">Thirty-four churches and church organizations are 
  formal participants in the new grouping, while eight others, which are 
  considering participation, remain observers. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">The launch had been delayed in mid-2005 after concerns 
  were raised by leaders of predominantly black churches as to whether another 
  national ecumenical body was needed in the United States alongside the US 
  National Council of Churches (NCC). They also questioned whether the new 
  grouping would address concerns important to their members, such as racial and 
  economic justice. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">The statement announcing the launch of the new grouping 
  noted that overcoming poverty was &quot;central to the mission of the church and 
  essential to our unity in Christ&quot;, and that participants had committed 
  themselves to work together to address the causes of poverty. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">Granberg-Michaelson made clear that membership now 
  includes representation from the five major church groupings in the United 
  States, including the historic black churches. Christian Churches Together is 
  not seen, at least for now, as supplanting the NCC. The Catholic Church, the 
  largest denomination in the United States, does not belong to the NCC nor do 
  many evangelical or Pentecostal groups. </font></p>
  <p><font color="black">CTT, however, includes participation by a variety of 
  groupings. They include several Orthodox churches; Protestant groups as the 
  Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Episcopal (Anglican) 
  Church; and bodies such as the Salvation Army, Open Bible Churches, 
  International Pentecostal Holiness Church and the humanitarian organization 
  World Vision.</font><noindex><font color="black"><br>

  <blockquote>
  <h1><span class="cnnStoryTime"><font size="3">
  Wednesday, November 17, 2004 </font></span><b style="font-size: 14px;">
  --WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's Roman Catholic bishops voted Wednesday to 
  join a new alliance that would be the broadest Christian group ever formed in 
  the United States, linking American evangelicals and Catholics in an 
  ecumenical organization for the first time.</b></h1>
  <p>The alliance, called <b> <a href="http://www.christianchurchestogether.org/">Christian Churches Together in the 
  U.S.A.</a></b>, is set to kick off next year. It would include mainline 
  Protestants, Orthodox Christians, and black and other minority churches. With 
  about 67 million U.S. members, the Catholic Church would be the largest 
  denomination.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This alliance between Protestants, and Catholics, was prophesied over 110 
  years ago:</p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The wide diversity of belief in the Protestant churches is regarded by 
    many as decisive proof that no effort to secure a forced uniformity can ever 
    be made. But there has been for years, in churches of the Protestant faith, 
    a strong and growing sentiment in favor of a union based upon common points 
    of doctrine. To secure such a union, the discussion of subjects upon which 
    all were not agreed--however important they might be from a Bible 
    standpoint--must necessarily be waived. </p>
    <p>Charles Beecher*, in a sermon in the year 1846, declared that the ministry 
    of &quot;the evangelical Protestant denominations&quot; is &quot;not only formed all the 
    way up under a tremendous pressure of merely human fear, but they live, and 
    move, and breathe in a state of things radically corrupt, and appealing 
    every hour to every baser element of their nature to hush up the truth, and 
    bow the knee to the power of apostasy. Was not this the way things went with 
    Rome? Are we not living her life over again? And what do we see just 
    ahead?--Another general council! A world's convention! evangelical alliance, 
    and universal creed!&quot; When this shall be gained, then, in the effort to 
    secure complete uniformity, it will be only a step to the resort to force.</p>
    <p>When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such points 
    of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the State to 
    enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant 
    America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the infliction 
    of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result.</p>

    <p>Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul, and Sunday 
    sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the 
    former lays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of 
    sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in 
    stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of Spiritualism; 
    they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and 
    under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the 
    steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience. </p>
