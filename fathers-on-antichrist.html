    <p>2 Th 2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
    Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,<br>
    2 Th 2:2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
    spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is
    at hand.<br>
    2 Th 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come,
    except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the
    son of perdition;<br>
    2 Th 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
    that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing
    himself that he is God.<br>
    2 Th 2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these
    things?<br>
    2 Th 2:6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his
    time.<br>
    2 Th 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
    letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.<br>
    2 Th 2:8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
    with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his
    coming:<br>
    2 Th 2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power
    and signs and lying wonders,<br>
    2 Th 2:10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that
    perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be
    saved.<br>
    2 Th 2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
    should believe a lie:<br>
    2 Th 2:12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
    pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that in the above passage, Paul tells the church at Thessalonica that
  the second coming is not near, that there must be a falling away from the
  faith, a great apostasy that must happen first. Second, the man of sin, the
  Antichrist must be revealed, but he was being prevented from rising to power
  by an entity that the Thessalonians already knew about (v.6), because Paul had
  already told them about it (v.5).</p>
	<p class="gtxt_body" style="margin-left: 40px">Paul distinctly tells us that 
	he knew, and that the Thessalonians knew, what that hindrance was, and that 
	it was then in existence. The early Church, through the writings of the 
	Fathers, tells us what it knew upon the subject, and with remarkable 
	unanimity affirms that this &quot;let,&quot; or hindrance, was the
	<span style="font-style:italic;">Roman empire as governed by the Caesars;
	</span>that while the Caesars held imperial power, it was impossible for the 
	predicted antichrist to arise, and that on the fall of the Caesars he
	<span style="font-style:italic;">would </span>arise. Here we have a point on 
	which Paul affirms the existence of knowledge in the Christian Church. The 
	early Church knew, he says, what this hindrance was. The early Church tells 
	us what it did know upon the subject, and no one in these days can be in a 
	position to contradict its testimony as to what Paul had, by word of mouth 
	only, told the Thessalonians. It is a point on which ancient tradition alone
	<span style="font-style:italic;">can </span>have any authority. Modern 
	speculation is positively impertinent on such a subject.<sup><span class="gstxt_sup">1</span></sup></p>

    invent another Father different from the Creator.<br>
    <br>
    1. In a still clearer light has John, in the Apocalypse, indicated to the
    Lord's disciples what shall happen in the last times, and concerning the ten
    kings who shall then arise, among whom the empire which now rules [the
    earth] shall be partitioned. He teaches us what the ten horns shall be which

  <p>Book V, Chapter 30</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, another danger, by no means trifling, shall overtake those who
    falsely presume that they know the name of Antichrist. For if these men
    assume one [number], when this [Antichrist] shall come having another, they
    will be easily led away by him, as supposing him not to be the expected one,
    who must be guarded against.<br>
    <br>
    2. These men, therefore, ought to learn [what really is the state of the
    case], and go back to the true number of the name, that they be not reckoned
    among false prophets. But, knowing the sure number declared by Scripture,
    that is, six hundred sixty and six, let them await, in the first place, the
    division of the kingdom into ten; then, in the next place, when these kings
    are reigning, and beginning to set their affairs in order, and advance their
    kingdom, [let them learn] to acknowledge that he who shall come claiming the
    kingdom for himself, and shall terrify those men of whom we have been
    speaking, having a name containing the aforesaid number, is truly the
    abomination of desolation. ...</p>
    <p>3. It is therefore more certain, and less hazardous, to await the
    fulfillment of the prophecy, than to be making surmises, and casting about
    for any names that may present themselves, inasmuch as many names can be
    found possessing the number mentioned; and the same question will, after
    all, remain unsolved. For if there are many names found possessing this
    number, it will be asked which among them shall the coming man bear. It is
    not through a want of names containing the number of that name that I say
    this, but on account of the fear of God, and zeal for the truth: for the
    name Evanthas (EUAN QAS) contains the required number, but I make no
    allegation regarding it. Then also Lateinos (LATEINOS) has the number six
    hundred and sixty-six; and it is a very probable [solution], this being the
    name of the last kingdom [of the four seen by Daniel]. For the Latins are
    they who at present bear rule: ...</p>

  (3rd Century)<br>
  </font></b>TREATISE ON CHRIST AND ANTICHRIST.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>25. Then he says: &quot;A fourth beast, dreadful and terrible; it had
    iron teeth and claws of brass.&quot; And who are these but the Romans? which
    (kingdom) is meant by the iron--the kingdom which is now established; for
    the legs of that (image) were of iron. And after this, what remains,
    beloved, but the toes of the feet of the image, in which part is iron and
    part clay, mixed together?<br>
    <br>
    And mystically by the toes of the feet he meant the kings who are to arise
    from among them; as Daniel also says (in the words), &quot;I considered the
    beast, and lo there were ten horns behind it, among which shall rise another
    (horn), an offshoot, and shall pluck up by the roots the three (that were)
    before it.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And under this was signified none other than Antichrist, who is also himself
    to raise the kingdom of the Jews. He says that three horns are plucked up by
    the root by him, viz., the three kings of Egypt, and Libya, and Ethiopia,
    whom he cuts off in the array of battle. And he, after gaining terrible
    power over all, being nevertheless a tyrant, shall stir up tribulation and
    persecution against men, exalting himself against them. For Daniel says:
    &quot;I considered the horn, and behold that horn made war with the saints,
    and prevailed against them, till the beast was slain and perished, and its
    body was given to the burning of fire.&quot;</p>
    <p>26. ...</p>
    <p>27. As these things, then, are in the future, and as the ten toes of the 
    image are equivalent to (so many) democracies, and the ten horns of the 
    fourth beast are distributed over ten kingdoms, let us look at the subject a 
    little more closely, and consider these matters as in the clear light of a 
    personal survey. </p>
    <p>28. The golden head of the image and the lioness denoted the Babylonians; 
    the shoulders and arms of silver, and the bear, represented the Persians and 
    Medes; the belly and thighs of brass, and the leopard, meant the Greeks, who 
    held the sovereignty from Alexander's time; the legs of iron, and the beast 
    dreadful and terrible, expressed the Romans, who hold the sovereignty at 
    present; the toes of the feet which were part clay and part iron, and the 
    ten horns, were emblems of the kingdoms that are yet to rise; the other 
    little horn that grows up among them meant the Antichrist in their midst; 
    the stone that smites the earth and brings judgment upon the world was 
    Christ. <br>

    arrived to the affairs of men and the whole world? It is that city, that 
    only, which still sustains all things; and the God of heaven is to be 
    entreated by us and implored -- if, indeed, His arrangements and decrees can

    <p>12. But this aforesaid Antichrist is to come when the times of the Roman
    empire shall have been fulfilled, and the end of the world is now drawing
    near. There shall rise up together ten kings of the Romans, reigning in
    different parts perhaps, but all about the same time; and after these an
    eleventh, the Antichrist, who by his magical craft shall seize upon the
    Roman power; and of the kings who reigned before him, three he shall humble,
    and the remaining seven he shall keep in subjection to himself. At first
    indeed he will put on a show of mildness (as though he were a learned and
    discreet person), and of soberness and benevolence: and by the lying [108]
    signs and wonders of his magical deceit a having beguiled the Jews, as
    though he were the expected Christ, he shall afterwards be characterized by
    all kinds of crimes of inhumanity and lawlessness, so as to outdo all
    unrighteous and ungodly men who have gone before him displaying against all
    men, but especially against us Christians, a spirit murderous and most
    cruel, merciless and crafty. And after perpetrating such things for three
    years and six months only, he shall be destroyed by the glorious second
    advent from heaven of the only-begotten Son of God, our Lord and Saviour
    Jesus, the true Christ, who shall slay Antichrist with the breath of His
    mouth, and shall deliver him over to the fire of hell.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be
    revealed in his own season. For the mystery of lawlessness doth already
    work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the
    way. And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom the Lord Jesus shall
    slay with the breath of His mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation
    of His coming: even he whose coming is according to the working of
    Satan.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    ONE may naturally enquire, what is that which withholdeth, and after that
    would know, why Paul expresses it so obscurely. What then is it that
    withholdeth, that is, hindereth him from being revealed? Some indeed say,
    the grace of the Spirit, but others the Roman empire, to whom I most of all
    accede. Wherefore? Because if he meant to say the Spirit, he would not have
    spoken obscurely, but plainly, that even now the grace of the Spirit, that
    is the gifts, withhold him. And otherwise he ought now to have come, if he
    was about to come when the gifts ceased; for they have long since ceased.
    But because he said this of the Roman empire, he naturally glanced at it,
    and speaks covertly and darkly. For he did not wish to bring upon himself
    superfluous enmities, and useless dangers. ... And he did not say that it
    will be quickly, although he is always saying it--but what? &quot;that he
    may be revealed in his own season,&quot; he says, &quot;For the mystery of
    lawlessness doth already work.&quot; He speaks here of Nero, as if he were
    the type of Antichrist. For he too wished to be thought a god. And he has
    well said, &quot;the mystery&quot;; that is, it worketh not openly, as the
    other, nor without shame. For if there was found a man before that time, he
    means, who was not much behind Antichrist in wickedness, what wonder, if
    there shall now be one? But he did not also wish to point him out plainly:
    and this not from cowardice, but instructing us not to bring upon ourselves
    unnecessary enmities, when there is noting to call for it. So indeed he also
    says here. &quot;Only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken
    out of the way,&quot; that is, when the Roman empire is taken out of the
    way, then he shall come. And naturally. For as long as the fear of this
    empire lasts, no one will willingly exit himself, but when that is
    dissolved, he will attack the anarchy, and endeavor to seize upon the
    government both of man and of God. For as the kingdoms before this were
    destroyed, for example, that of the Medes by the Babylonians, that of the
    Babylonians by the Persians, that of the Persians by the Macedonians, that
    of the Macedonians by the Romans: so will this also be by the Antichrist,
    and he by Christ, and it will no longer withhold. And these things Daniel
    delivered to us with great clearness.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;And then,&quot; he says, &quot;shall be revealed the lawless
    one.&quot; And what after this? The consolation is at hand. &quot;Whom the
    Lord Jesus shall slay with the breath of His mouth, and bring to nought by
    the manifestation of His coming, even he whose coming is according to the
    working of Satan.&quot;<br>

  <p>The testimony is clear, the early church fathers quoted above generally
  expected the Antichrist to rise to power very soon after the fall of pagan
  Rome as prophesied in the book of Daniel, chapter 7. At the time that Paul
  wrote to the church at Thessalonica, the Caesars ruled, and until they were
  removed they restrained the Antichrist from rising to prominence and
  exercising his power. This is why Paul could not speak openly about the
  restrainer in his letter, because he did not want to invite unnecessary
  persecution by identifying Rome openly and predicting its demise. Pagan Rome's rule
  ended in 476 A.D., so the above fathers were writing, in some cases, hundreds
  of years before the event, demonstrating that they understood prophecy, at
  least on that point.</p>
  <p>There is only one entity that fulfills the timing spoken of by Paul, and
  expounded upon by the above quoted church fathers, which rose in prominence
  after the fall and division of the Roman empire in the 5th century, and
  subsequently took control of <i>both</i> civil and ecclesiastical governments, 
  ruling for 1260 years (3 1/2 times) exactly as prophesied, and that is the 
  papacy of the Roman Catholic Church, from 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D.</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Pope Pius IX (1846-1878) gave 
  this remarkable testimony, which when examined in conjunction with Daniel 
  chapter 7, precisely identifies the little horn, the man of sin, the 
  Antichrist power:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>La Chiesa Cattolica fondata e istituita da Cristo Signore per provvedere 
    alla salvezza eterna degli uomini, avendo conseguito, in forza della sua 
    divina istituzione, la forma di società perfetta, deve godere, 
    nell’esercizio del suo sacro ministero, di quella libertà che la sottrae 
    alla soggezione di qualsivoglia potere civile.</p>
    <p>Poiché per operare liberamente, come era necessario, doveva fruire di 
    quei supporti che rispondevano alle condizioni e alle esigenze dei tempi, 
    per una speciale disposizione della divina Provvidenza avvenne che, quando 
    l’Impero Romano si dissolse e fu diviso in vari regni, il Romano Pontefice, 
    costituito da Cristo capo e centro di tutta la Chiesa, ottenne un Principato 
    civile.</p>
    <p>Questo fu disposto con somma sapienza da Dio stesso, perché in mezzo ad 
    una tale moltitudine e varietà di sovrani temporali, il Sommo Pontefice 
    disponesse di quella libertà politica che era indispensabile per esercitare, 
    senza alcun impedimento, il suo potere spirituale, la sua autorità e la sua 
    giurisdizione sul mondo intero. <font face="Times New Roman">&#8722; 
    Pius IX, Apostolic Letter <b><i>
    <a href="http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ITA0493/_P2.HTM">Cum Catholica 
    Ecclesia</a></i></b>, March 26, 1860.</font></p>
    <p align="left">The Catholic Church which was founded and instituted by Our 
    Lord Jesus Christ to procure the eternal salvation of men, has, by reason of 
    this divine institution, the form of a perfect society. Therefore, she must 
    possess liberty such that she cannot be subject to any civil power in the 
    execution of her sacred ministry. </p>
    <p align="left">To act with freedom, as it is just she should, she has 
    always needed the assistance which was suitable to the conditions and the 
    necessities of the age. It is, therefore, by a particular decree of Divine 
    Providence that, at the fall of the Roman Empire and its partition into 
    separate kingdoms, the Roman Pontiff, whom Christ made the head and center 
    of his entire Church, acquired civil power.</p>
    <p align="left">Certainly, it was by a most wise design of God Himself that 
    in the midst of so great a multitude and variety of temporal princes, the 
    Sovereign Pontiff enjoyed political liberty, which is so necessary for him 
    to exercise his spiritual power, his authority, and his jurisdiction over 
    the whole world.</p>

	<hr>This is a common Protestant view on Antichrist from over 280 years ago:<p style="margin-left: 40px">Q.<em> Is the</em> Pope Antichrist ?<br><em>A.</em> If he be not <em>
Antichrist himself</em>, he is <em>vilely like him</em>; though we mean; not so 
much <em>one single Man</em>, as the whole <em>Polity</em> and <em>Hyrarchy</em> 
of <em>Rome</em>. We have had <em>above twenty Archbishops and Bishops</em> of 
the <em>Church</em> of <em>England</em>, since the <em>Reformation</em>, who 
have expressly asserted that <em>Rome</em> is <em>Babylon</em>, and the <em>Pope 
Antichrist</em>. And the <em>Homilies</em> themselves do not obscurely <em>
intimate</em> the same. 'Tis the avowed <em>Faith</em> of all the <em>Foreign</em> 
Protestant <em>Churches</em>, and has been so in all <em>Ages</em>: The poor <em>
Waldensees</em>, the <em>Bohemians</em>,and the Followers of <em>Wickliff</em> 
here in <em>England</em>, held the same. But <em>Argument</em> is the best <em>
Authority</em>; and it is thus argued, that he is the <em>great Antichrist</em>.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; 'Tis granted that the
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 1em; FONT-FAMILY: 'Galatia SIL'; COLOR: black">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span>
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 1em; FONT-FAMILY: 'Galatia SIL'; COLOR: black">

</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1em; FONT-FAMILY: 'Galatia SIL'; COLOR: black">
the</span> <em>Adversary</em> that <em>exalts</em> himself <em>against</em>, and 
in the <em>Seat</em> of God, is the same with this<span style="FONT-SIZE: 1em; FONT-FAMILY: 'Galatia SIL';">
</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1em; FONT-FAMILY: 'Galatia SIL'; COLOR: black">
&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#8055;&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, or <em>Antichrist</em>, Christ's <em>Vicar</em>, or rather, 
his <em>Rival</em> in the <em>World.</em> But this <em>Man of Si</em>n, this <em>
Son of Perdition</em>, if anywhere in the <em>World</em>, is to be found at <em>
Rome</em>, all the <em>Marks</em> the <em>Holy Spirit</em> gives exactly 
agreeing: </p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;">&mdash;&mdash; The <em>Man of Sin</em> exalts 
himself<span style="font-style: normal"> above all that's <em>called God</em>;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; so does the <em>Pope</em>, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; above <em>Kings</em> and <em>Emperors</em>, earthly <em>Gods</em>:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; The <em>Man of Sin</em> sits in the <em>Temple of God, shewing</em>, 
or <em>making Ostentation</em> of himself, that he is <em>God</em>: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; So, to a Tittle, does the <em>Pope</em>, who is placed upon 
the holy <em>Altar</em>, and solemnly <em>adored</em>; nay, whom they call, <em>
Our Lord God the Pope</em>. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; There was something which did<em> let</em>, in the <em>
Apostles</em> time, why this <em>Man of Sin</em> should not immediately <em>
appear</em> in the World; and something must be removed or taken out of the Way, 
before it could be done; and something which for some Reason or other, the 
Apostles thought not<em> fit</em> more plainly to mention </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">—— All which is interpreted by the <em>ancient Fathers</em> themselves, of the
<em>Roman Power</em> and <em>Empire</em>: This Empire is now taken away, </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; that which <em>succeeds</em> in its room, and whose <em>Power</em> 
was hindered from <em>appearing</em> while that remained, must be <em>Antichrist</em>:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">&mdash;&mdash; This belongs, without dispute, to the <em>Pope</em>, therefore 
he is <em>Antichrist</em>. </p>
