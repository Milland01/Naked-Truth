<blockquote>
  <p>An extraordinary event occurred on January 18th, 2000, that went largely
  unnoticed by the world's media. On that day Pope John Paul II opened the
  fourth and final holy door in Rome at St. Paul's outside the walls, a symbolic
  proclamation of the Jubilee year, along with its plenary papal indulgence.</p>

        apart from previous Jubilees was that it also was designated as the
        event beginning a week of prayer for <i>Christian Unity! </i>The
        Reformation was sparked over the issue of indulgences, which were the
        subject of Martin Luther's 95 theses, yet this ceremonial opening of a
        holy door and attached papal indulgence was attended by the most
        significant ecumenical assembly of Catholics and non-Catholic Christians
        since Vatican II.</td>

  <p>By attending this event in the name of unity, the participants were, in
  effect, acknowledging the primacy of the papacy <i>and </i>the authority of
  the pope to grant indulgences! Among the more prominent attendees were the
  Archbishop of Canterbury, representing the Anglican Church, and the president
  of the Lutheran World Federation, representing approximately 90% of the
  world's Lutherans. Below are links that detail this amazing event, which is
  truly a milestone marker on the road that is apparently leading some
  denominations to ultimate unity with the papacy and the Church of Rome,
  perhaps in the not too distant future.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>The Bible does have something to say about the opening of holy doors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 3:7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
    things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of
    David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man
    openeth;<br>
    Rev 3:8 I know thy works: behold,<b> I have set before thee an open door,
    and no man can shut it:</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">In contrast to scripture, next year the holy doors of Rome
  will all be closed, and the special papal indulgence ended, until the next
  Catholic Jubilee year of 2025. But God has opened a door to forgiveness that
  no Pope can shut:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
    to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
    ...<br>
    1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
    not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
    the righteous:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The biblical way to forgiveness is to go to Jesus Christ
  directly, our advocate with the Father, but <i>not</i> by passing through
  cathedral doors in Rome or papal indulgences.</p>
