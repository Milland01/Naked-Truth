<blockquote>
  <p>What follows is a discussion taken from the tnn.religion.catholic newsgroup
  (or Email) in which I answered a challenge issued to Sola Scriptura advocates
  by Bryan Mccahill, a Roman Catholic. (Some spelling and obvious errors have
  been corrected).</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill issues a challenge, 4 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>I've said in a previous post, that in regard to the &quot;idol-image&quot;
  thing there is a passage in scripture that gives Protestants much difficulty.
  In Gen 31:19, Rachel steals her fathers &quot;terafim&quot;. The Protestants
  translate this as &quot;images&quot;. (i.e., forbidden by the first
  commandment). However in Hosea 3, the prophet foretells the lamentable state
  of the Israelites, saying they will be long without King, Priest, Sacrifice,
  Altar, Ephod or Terafim. This indicates that in the proper context a &quot;Terafim&quot;
  is not only not an evil thing, but something that sits alongside, King,
  Priest, Sacrifice, Altar and Ephod.
  <p>So figure that one out, my &quot;sola scriptura&quot; friends.
  <p>&nbsp;

  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response, Fri, 04 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>BMccahill could not be more wrong in his implication that teraphim were
  probably holy or permitted or somehow authorized by God:
  <p>-----
  <p>On Genesis 31:19
  <p><img src="idol.jpg" align="RIGHT" hspace="20" width="110" height="236"> These “images,” teraphim
  (see Judges 17:5; 18:14; etc.), were usually small (v. 34) human figurines,
  occasionally larger, often made of wood (1 Sam. 19:13-16). Near Eastern
  excavations have brought them to light in profuse numbers, made of wood, clay,
  and precious metals. Some represent male gods, but the majority are figurines
  of female deities 2 to 3 in. in length. They were used as household gods or
  were carried on the body as protective charms. Since most of them represent
  nude goddesses whose sexual features are accentuated, they were probably
  thought to promote fertility. This may be the reason Rachel especially
  cherished them. Cuneiform texts from Nuzi in Mesopotamia reveal that the
  household gods were inherited by adopted sons only when no actual sons were
  present at the father’s death. If a man had sons, his gods could not go to
  his daughters. Rachel therefore had no right to her father’s household gods,
  as Jacob frankly admitted <nobr>(Gen. 31:32).</nobr> Documents found at Nuzi,
  in Mesopotamia, indicate that in the patriarchal age the possession of the
  family’s household gods, such as Laban had, guaranteed to their holder the
  title to his father’s properties. This was probably the chief reason why
  Laban was so eager to retrieve them (see vs. 30, 33–35).
  <p>The Mesopotamian laws decreed capital punishment for the theft of divine
  property (Code of Hammurabi, sec. 6;), and the validity of this law was
  recognized by Jacob in his declaration that whoever had Laban’s gods should
  die (ch 31:32). He seems to have learned later that these and other gods were
  in the possession of his wives, hence demanded their surrender and buried them
  (ch 35:2–4). During the period of the judges Micah set up teraphim and other
  idols in his house and arranged for their worship (Jgs 17:4, 5). These cult
  objects, later carried to Dan, probably formed the nucleus of the idolatrous
  worship that existed there for centuries (ch 18:14, 30, 31). Samuel declared
  Saul’s sin of stubbornness to be as idolatry (Heb. teraphim; 1 Sa 15:23).
  Hosea denounced the use of teraphim in the northern kingdom of Israel (Hos
  3:4). Josiah destroyed them wherever he could find them in his work of
  reformation (2 Ki 23:24), but Zec 10:2 suggests that some were possibly found
  among the Jews as late as the postexilic period.
  <p>Jacob tells Israel to put away strange gods:
  <p>[KJV] Gen 35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were
  with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and
  change your garments:
  <p>The prospect of meeting with God at Bethel led to a thorough work of
  reform. There was much to be done before Jacob and his household were ready to
  face the Lord (see Amos 4:12; 1 John 3:3). Out of consideration for his wives
  Jacob had tolerated the presence of idols in their tents. These strange gods
  probably included the teraphim Rachel had stolen from her father (Gen. 31:19),
  the images of his servants, and others which may have come into the possession
  of his sons with the spoils of Shechem.
  <p>The above is from my SDA Bible Commentary and Bible Dictionary.
  <p>-----
  <p>From Holman's Bible Dictionary (computer version):<br>
  Teraphim are related to divination (Judg. 17:5; 18:14-20; 1 Sam. 15:23; 2
  Kings 23:24; Hos. 3:3-4; Ezek. 21:21; Zech. 10:2)
  <p>-----
  <p>From Smith's Bible Dictionary, Thomas Nelson Publisher:
  <p>The teraphim, translated &quot;images&quot; in the Authorized Version,
  carried away from Laban by Rachel were regarded by Laban as gods, and it would
  therefore appear that they were used by those who added corrupt practices to
  the patriarchal religion. Teraphim again are included among Micah's images.
  Judges 17:3-5; 18:17,18, 20. Teraphim were consulted for oracular answers by
  the Israelites, Zech. 10:2; comp. Judges 18:5,6; 1 Sam 15:22,23; 19:13,16, LXX.,
  and 2 Kings 23:24; and by the Babylonians in the case of Nebuchadnezzar. Ezek
  21:19-22.
  <p>-----
  <p>From the New Bible Dictionary, Inter-Varsity Press:
  <p>These objects [teraphim] are mentioned in every OT period... When mentioned
  in Israelite contexts they are almost always condemned, directly <nobr>(1 Sa.
  15:23, 2 Ki. 23:24) </nobr>or indirectly <nobr>(Jdg. 17:6; Zc. 10:2).</nobr>
  In their use, they are mostly associated with divination: note the pairing of
  ephod and teraphim in the idolatrous religion of Micah (Jdg. 17:5, etc.)
  <p>-----
  <p>So, the fact that Israel possessed teraphim at times, or even most of the
  time, is proof of their constant apostasy, not proof that teraphim were
  approved by God!
  <p>Far from being a problem for Protestants as BMccahill claims, Protestants
  easily recognize teraphim for the pagan idols that they were. This only shows
  that BMccahill probably does not possess a non-Catholic Bible dictionary or
  commentary which would clearly explain to him how teraphim are idols
  indicating apostasy. I would suggest that he needs to consult Protestant
  publications for what Protestants believe, and not Catholic sources.
  <p>It is also curious to note that these teraphim idols were consulted as
  oracles. Roman Catholics do exactly the same at sites of Marian apparitions,
  that have statues or images of Mary that will allegedly weep tears, bleed
  blood etc.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler continues, Sun, 06 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>BMccahill has asked me via Email to explain specifically Hosea Chapter 3
  and teraphim in detail:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    [KJV] Hosea 3:1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
    her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the
    children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Lord tells Hosea to take an adulteress as his wife. This adulteress is
  symbolic of Israel who have turned to idolatry. Yet this taking an adulteress
  as a wife is symbolic of God's love for fallen apostate Israel.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    [KJV] Hosea 3:2 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for
    an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  The price paid is very low for the times, about what would be paid for a
  common maidservant, showing in symbolism how far Israel had fallen.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    [KJV] Hosea 3:3 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
    shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I
    also be for thee.
  </blockquote>
  <p>No longer permitted to be the harlot, the wife, symbolic of Israel, would
  *not* be given full status as a wife either. A period of deprivation
  (captivity) was prophesied to be endured by Israel.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    [KJV] Hosea 3:4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
    king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image,
    and without an ephod, and without teraphim:
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because of their apostasy and idolatry (v.1) Israel would go into captivity
  where they would be denied their pagan idols, images, and associated pagan
  ephods (priestly garb), but they would also lose their king and princes. (The
  kingdom would be lost.) This parallels and explains the symbolism of verse 3.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    [KJV] Hosea 3:5 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
    LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his
    goodness in the latter days.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Following their captivity by Assyria, Israel would return to the Lord
  (repent), and David would be their king.
  <p>(For the captivity prophesied, see beginning with 2 Kings 18:9)
  <p>So while BMccahill claims that the association with items in verse 4
  somehow indicate that teraphim where accepted by God, the idolatry and
  apostasy of the images, ephod and teraphim are equated with harlotry in verse
  3, and the loss of princes and king with the deprivation (captivity) or
  withholding of full status with God, as also indicated by verse 3. Clearly
  this punishment of Israel by going into captivity is due to their idolatry as
  indicated in verse 1. Another verse is worth noting:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    [KJV] 1 Sam 15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and
    stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry [teraphiym:H8655]. Because thou
    hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being
    king.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Please note that the word &quot;teraphim&quot; is equated with iniquity and
  witchcraft and is translated as idolatry. There is no way that these idols
  were acceptable to God, not any more than the golden calf was acceptable at
  Sinai.
  <p>&nbsp;

  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill responded, 6 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>Sorry , Mike, but &quot;that dog won't hunt&quot;. You call upon
  surrounding passages in order to create the visual illusion of a buttressed
  argument, but the fact remains. Terafim, in Genesis 31:19, is translated in
  Protestant bibles as &quot;images&quot;, but in Hosea, seeing that it does not
  conform to their invented doctrine, leave the word untranslated, as &quot;terafim&quot;.(better
  that no one understand it, right?) You're dead on this one, partner. Hosea
  3:4, shows plainly that along with a King, a Priest, an altar and ephod,
  terafim had their rightful places in Jewish society, and derivatively,
  Christian society as well; not as idols, but as visual aids to inspire
  believers and raise their spirits to God.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response, Sun, 06 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>This just shows how desperate BMccahill is to justify statues and images in
  Catholic worship. I expect that every Protestant commentary or Bible
  Dictionary define Teraphim as idols showing apostasy, yet BMccahill maintains
  that Protestants have some kind of &quot;problem&quot; with interpreting Hosea
  3.
  <p><em>&gt; You call upon surrounding passages in order to create the<br>
  &gt; visual illusion of a buttressed argument...
  <p></em>It is called context, and is quite necessary to ascertain the truth.
  <p><em>&gt; Hosea 3:4, shows plainly that along with a King, a Priest,<br>
  &gt; an altar and ephod, terafim had their rightful places in<br>
  &gt; in Jewish society, and derivatively, Christian society<br>
  &gt; as well; not as idols, but as visual aids to inspire<br>
  &gt; believers and raise their spirits to God.
  <p></em>As archeology has shown, these teraphim were most frequently nude
  female figurines with accentuated sexual features. BMccahill is so blind to
  the truth and so married to Catholic teaching and practices that he would
  rather attempt to prove the merits of idolatry for Israel in Hosea than accept
  the truth. There are none so blind as those who refuse to see the truth.
  <p>Perhaps BMccahill would like to comment on the 6th Chapter of Baruch and
  how that encourages the crowning and dressing of idols, carrying them in
  procession, and lighting candles in front of them, like Catholics do with
  statues of Mary, Peter, and saints.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill responded, 7 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>Michael Scheifler, bereft of a solution to the dilemma presented by Hosea
  3:4, hops to another part of scripture, and replies:
  <p><em>&gt; Perhaps BMccahill would like to comment on the 6th Chapter of<br>
  &gt; Baruch and how that encourages the crowning and dressing of idols,<br>
  &gt; carrying them in procession, and lighting candles in front of them,<br>
  &gt; like Catholic do with statues of Mary, Peter, and saints.
  <p></em>Clearly, this chapter talks about terafim as idols, because the
  Babylonians worshipped them as gods. I see no need to reiterate traditional
  Catholic teachings with regard to statues and images of the saints. Look it up
  in the Catholic Catechism - there you will find the official teaching on the
  subject. But you still are unable to explain how &quot;terafim&quot; sits
  alongside the other evidences of a happy nation, viz., King, Priest, altar and
  ephod. I'm telling you partner, you're a dead man on this one.

  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response, Sun, 06 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>Since you are so certain of yourself, then I expect that you will not
  object to my putting our entire conversation verbatim on my web page to
  demonstrate the effectiveness of your argument. As yet I do not know your
  first name, but in order to give you proper credit for your remarks, could you
  please provide it? Should you not approve of this, then I will delete any
  reference to your name in my article, and keep you quite anonymous. By the

  interpretation of Hosea 3 that you present?
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill's response of 7 April, 1997.</strong>
  <p>Not at all - be my guest. As a matter of fact, you might as well include
  the pronouncement on this subject by the 7th ecumenical council, or Third
  council of Nicea of 787 AD attended by 367 Bishops:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    &quot;To make our confession short, we keep unchanged all the ecclesiastical
    traditions handed down to us, whether in writing or verbally, one of which
    is the making of pictorial representations, agreeable to the history of the
    preaching of the Gospel, a tradition useful in many respects, but especially
    in this, that so the incarnation of the Word of God is shown forth as real
    and not merely fantastic, for these have mutual indications and without
    doubt have also mutual significations. We, therefore, following the royal
    pathway and the divinely inspired authority of our Holy Fathers and the
    traditions of the Catholic Church (for, as we all know, eth Holy Spirit
    indwells her), define with all certitude and accuracy that just as the
    figure of the precious and life-giving Cross, so also the venerable and holy
    images, as well in painting and mosaic as of other fit materials, should be
    set forth in the holy churches of God, and on the sacred vessels and on the
    vestments and on hangings and in pictures both in houses and by the wayside,
    to wit, the figure of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, of our spotless
    Lady, the Mother of God, of the honourable Angels, of all Saints and of all
    pious people. For by so much more frequently as they are seen in artistic
    representation, by so much more readily are men lifted up to the memory of
    their prototypes, and to a longing after them; and to these should be given
    due salutation and honorable reverence not indeed that true worship of faith
    which pertains alone to the divine nature; but to these, as to the figure of
    the precious and life-giving Cross and to the Book of the Gospels and to the
    other holy objects, incense and lights may be offered according to ancient
    pious custom. For the honor which is paid to the image passes on to that
    which the image represents, and he who reveres the image reveres in it the
    subject represented.&quot;
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <em>&gt; As yet I do not know your first name, but in order to give you proper
  credit for your remarks, could you please provide it?</em>
  <p>Bryan
  <p>Scheifler also asks:
  <p><em>&gt; By the way, do you have a proper official Catholic source to cite
  for the interpretation of Hosea 3 that you present?</em>
  <p>Sure do - from the original Douay annotations:
  <p>Hosea 3:4 &quot;Theraphim signifying images good or bad, being here joined
  with King, Prince, sacrifice, altar and ephod, must needs signify lawful
  images such as were religiously used in the temple of God. 3 Reg 7 v. 36&quot;
  <p>Knock yourself out.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response of 7 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>I too have a Douay Rheims Bible, one with the Imprimatur of James Cardinal
  Gibbons of 1899 and it has no such note in the margin. It seems there has been
  a change in Catholic thinking on the matter since the Douay was originally
  published in 1610. And the New American Bible is an updated or revised version
  of the Douay, which was completed in 1970, and was previously known as the
  Confraternity Bible. Here is what it says on Hosea:
  <p><strong>The New American Bible for Catholics on Hosea Chapter 3:</strong>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    Hosea 3:1 Again the Lord said to me<br>
    Give your love to a woman<br>
    beloved of a paramour, and adulteress;<br>
    Even as the Lord loves the people of Israel,<br>
    though they turn to other gods<br>
    and are fond of raisin cakes.
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  Note for 3:1 - Raisin cakes: offerings to the fertility goddess Ashera, the
  female counterpart of Baal; of Jer 7:18; 44:19.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    Hosea 3:2 So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a
    lethech of barley.
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  Note for 3:2 - Homer: about 10 bushels. Lethech: a half-homer.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    Hosea 3:3 Then I said to her:<br>
    &quot;Many days you shall wait for me;<br>
    you shall not play the harlot<br>
    Or belong to any man;<br>
    I in turn will wait for you.&quot;
    <p>Hosea 3:4 For the people of Israel shall remain many days<br>
    without king or prince,<br>
    Without sacrifice or sacred pillar,<br>
    without ephod or household idols.
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  Notes for 3:4 - Sacred pillar: the stone massebah, originally perhaps a
  phallic symbol, representing Baal. These were also used, with another
  signification, in Israelite worship; See notes [below] on Gn 28:18; Ex 34:13.
  Ephod: an instrument used in consulting the deity; cf 1 Sm 23:6-12; 30:7; See
  notes [below] on Ex 28:6, 15-30. Household idols: images regarded as the
  tutelary deities of the household; cf Gn 31:19; Jgs 17:5; 18:14; 17f.
  <p>Note for Genesis 28:18 - Memorial stone: In Hebrew masseba, a stone which
  may vary in shape and size, set upright and usually intended for some
  religious purpose. Since the custom of erecting such &quot;sacred
  pillars&quot; in Palestine went back to its pre-Israelite period, their pagan
  associations were often retained; therefore, later Israelite religion forbade
  their erection (Lv 26:1; Dt 16:22) and ordered the destruction of those that
  were associated with paganism (Ex 34:31; Dt 12:3)
  <p>Note for Exodus 28:6 - Ephod: this Hebrew word is retained in the
  translation because it is the technical term for a peculiar piece of the
  priestly vestments, the exact nature of which is uncertain. It seems to have
  been a sort of apron that hung from the shoulders of the priest by shoulder
  straps <nobr>(v 7) </nobr>and was tied around his waist by the loose ends of
  the attached belt (v 8).
  <p>Notes for Exodus 28:15-30 - Breastplate in shape like a modern altar burse,
  it was a pocket-like recepticle for holding the Urim and Thummin (v 30), and
  formed an integral part of the ephod, to which it was attached by an elaborate
  sytem of rings and chains. Both the ephod and the breastplate were made of
  brocaded linen.
  <p>Note for Exodus 34:13 - Sacred poles: &quot;Ashera&quot; was the name of a
  Canaanite goddess. In her honor wooden poles (asherot) were erected, just as
  stone pillars (massebot) were erected in honor of the god Baal. Both were
  placed near the altar in a Canaanite shrine.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>So, it would seem that now, based on the New American Bible for Catholics,
  at least some Catholics themselves interpret the sacred pillar, ephod and
  household idols to all be quite pagan in nature, and it is quite clear from
  verse 1 that Israel was going into captivity because of their idolatry- their
  love of other gods.
  <p>In context the items in verse 4 were clearly being taken away because of
  their pagan idolatrous nature. Yes, altars and an ephod were used in the
  Hebrew sanctuary, but the items being described in Hosea are paganized
  versions related only to idol worship, for which Israel is being condemned and
  going into captivity for as punishment, so they were even going to lose the
  right to govern themselves (king and prince). It seems that the Catholic
  scholars that produced the notes for the Catholic New American Bible agree.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill's next response of 7 April, 1997.</strong>
  <p>Have reviewed your web page, and respond as follows: You say:
  <p><em>&gt; I too have a Douay Rheims Bible, one with the Imprimatur of James
  Cardinal Gibbons of 1899 and it has no such note in the margin. It seems there
  has been a change in Catholic thinking on the matter since the Douay was
  originally published in 1610.</em>
  <p>An Imprimatur means that it is free from doctrinal error. It does not
  necessarily indicate that all annotations are infallible, or are not subject
  to dispute.
  <p>Next: [on the NAB for Catholics]
  <p>First of all, I don't know where they get &quot;sacred pillar&quot; from
  &quot;altari&quot;, which is used in the Latin Vulgate. I would not be
  surprised, however if the annotators consulted a Protestant Bible for their
  information. Beware of any &quot;American&quot; Catholic anything - it's a
  watchword for liberal. Though there is nothing in the notes which is contrary
  to official Catholic teaching, it does not require one's assent either. We
  have a lot more freedom than Protestants in this area.
  <p>Nevertheless, your interpretation is incoherent. I don't see the connection
  between the verses previous (Hosea 3: 1,2,3) or after (Hosea 3:5 ) except that
  we are to understand in the next chapter, that God has punished Israel because
  (Hosea 4:1-2) &quot;there is no truth, and there is no mercy, there is no
  knowledge of God in the land, . Cursing and lying and manslaughter and theft
  and adultery hath overflowed, and blood hath touched blood.&quot; Because of
  this, &quot;many days shall the children of Israel be without King, and
  without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without ephod,
  and without teraphim.&quot; Thus they were deprived of their teraphim by God,
  temporarily.
  <p>You might also be interested in another annotation from the Douay
  concerning Exodus 20:4 (what Protestants call &quot;graven images&quot;)
  <p>&quot; Here, the same falsifiers of Christian doctrine not only pervert the
  sense of Holy Scripture, wresting that against images, which is spoken against
  idols, but also shamefully corrupt the text, by translating &quot;graven
  images&quot;, neither following the Hebrew, Greek nor Latin. For the hebrew
  word &quot;pefel&quot;, is the very same &quot;sculptile&quot; in Latin, that
  is &quot;a graven or carved thing&quot;. The Greek have &quot;eidwol&quot; an
  idol, thus all Protestant English Bibles are false.&quot;
  <p>P.S. and must you be so lengthy?
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response of 7 April 1997:</strong>
  <p><em>&gt; An Imprimatur means that it is free from doctrinal error. It does
  not necessarily indicate that all annotations are infallible, or are not
  subject to dispute.</em>
  <p>Then that surely applies as well to the notes in your edition of the Douay
  Rheims.
  <p>The problem you are encountering with sacred pillars may be due to your
  reliance on the Vulgate, which is itself a translation. The word in question
  in the Hebrew/Chaldee is H6754/5 &quot;tselem&quot;. Note this prohibition in
  Leviticus that uses the exact same word-
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols [H3808, eliyl] nor graven image [H6754,
    tselem], neither rear you up a standing image [H4676, matstsebah], <strong>neither
    shall ye set up any image</strong> [H4906, maskiyth] ] <strong>of stone in
    your land, to bow down unto it:</strong> for I am the LORD your God.
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  So the exact same type of image is found in Hosea 3:4. Note that the
  prohibition in Leviticus is against bowing down before any image, pillar, or
  image of stone (maskiyth = statue or figure) what-so-ever. <em>There are no
  exceptions mentioned.</em>
  <p>Funny thing, the same wording is found in Exodus 20:4. For the word graven
  the word is <nobr>H6459, &quot;pecel&quot; </nobr>which is derived from:
  <p>H6458. pacal, paw-sal'; a prim. root; to carve, whether wood or
  stone:--grave, hew.
  <p>The word for image is H6754, &quot;tselem&quot; which means figure or
  likeness. The prohibition is against carving a statue, a graven image, and
  bowing down to it. I don't quite see the distinction the original Douay is
  trying to make. Isn't sculpting an idol and carving an idol the same thing?
  Interestingly the 1899 revised Douay Rheims takes a quite different approach:
  <p>Note for Exodus 20:4 - All such images, or likenesses, are forbidden by
  this commandment, as are made to be adored and served; according to that which
  immediately follows, <em>thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them.</em> That
  is, all such as are designed for <em>idols</em> or <em>image-gods</em>, or are
  worshipped with divine honour. But otherwise images, pictures, or
  representations, even in the house of God, and in the very sanctuary so far
  from being forbidden, are expressly authorized by the word of God. See Ex.
  25:15 [18?]; chap 38:7; Num 21:8,9; 1 Chron. or Paralip 28:18,19; 2 Chron. or
  Paralip. 3:10.
  <p>You will not find, in all of scripture, where bowing down to any image was <em>ever</em>
  condoned. Not even in the Hebrew Temple did the priests bow down to the images
  of cherubims on the Ark or draperies. Bowing down to a king is a sign that you
  are his servant, and the same is true of idols. That is why bowing to any
  image, <em>without exeception</em>, is strongly prohibited. Yet the Catholic
  Church teaches you to do just that, bow down in front of statues and other
  images!
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
    any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that
    is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 <strong>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them</strong>, nor serve
    them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
    fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
    hate me;
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  <em>&gt; We have a lot more freedom than Protestants in this area.</em>
  <p>Since Protestants have no Pope or Magisterium, and any Protestant can
  publish his or her own Bible with their own margin notes, something Catholics
  are denied, I hardly see how a Catholic has more freedom in this area. In
  fact, if you go strictly by long standing Catholic teaching, you are not
  permitted by the church to even own a Protestant Bible, whether it has notes
  or not. And you are <em>not</em> permitted to interprete scripture in any
  manner contrary to the established teaching or interpretation of the Catholic
  Church, whether published or not. That doesn't sound like freedom to me.
  <p><em>&gt; P.S. and must you be so lengthy?</em>
  <p>When you have the weight of evidence on your side, it is difficult not to
  present it.

  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill's email response of 8 April, 1997.</strong>
  <p>[Regarding my quote from Smith's Bible Dictionary above]
  <p>Very thorough...not. How come there is no mention of the passage I cited,
  viz., Hosea 3:4? Too embarrassed? And you've yet to explain why it is
  translated as &quot;images&quot; in Genesis and left as &quot;terafphim&quot;
  in Hosea. Obviously, an anti-catholic agenda was set in the minds of the
  translators, not an innocent search for truth.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response of 8 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>I cited the Bible dictionaries to make the point that Protestants do not
  have the problem with teraphim that you have invented. A Bible dictionary is
  *not* a concordance. A concordance lists every occurance of a word in the
  Bible, a Bible dictionary defines and explains the term. What Smith's
  Dictionary does tell you is that teraphim were considered to be gods, that
  they were a corrupt practice (apostasy), and used as oracles (divination). I
  doubt you will find a Bible dictionary in print that claims teraphim were in
  any way approved by God.
  <p><em>&gt; And you've yet to explain why it is translated as
  &quot;images&quot; in Genesis and left as &quot;terafphim&quot; in Hosea.
  Obviously, an anti-catholic agenda was set in the minds of the translators,
  not an innocent search for truth.</em>
  <p>I fail to see your logic here. The word teraphim is left untranslated in
  the King James in each of the following verses in Judges as well-
  <p>Judges 17:5, 18:14,17,18, 20.
  <p>I would suggest that leaving just that word untranslated causes no
  confusion at all for those willing to study the matter. However, when a word
  has been translated, there is a possiblity of a mistranslation in context. A
  good example is your insistance that the word altar is in the text of the
  Vulgate, yet the word is &quot;tselem&quot; in the Hebrew text, which means an
  idolatrous image. So the Vulgate would appear to be a mistranslation, while
  more recent texts more correctly translate the term as image or sacred pillar.
  <p>So while you consider the New American Bible too liberal in their
  translation, I would suggest that on this verse, it has been willing to deal
  with the meaning of the original Hebrew, as do the Protestants, and break from
  the Vulgate.
  <p>In fact, if teraphim were left untranslated in every occurance in the
  Bible, perhaps you would be less likely to maintain that teraphim were
  permitted by God. Here are two examples-
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    1 Sam 15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
    as iniquity and [teraphim]. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD,
    he hath also rejected thee from being king.
    <p>2 Ki 23:24 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
    and the [teraphim], and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied
    in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might
    perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the
    priest found in the house of the LORD.
    <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  Please note the linking of teraphim with iniquity and witchcraft in 1 Samuel,
  and wizardry and abomination in 2 Kings. Are you at least willing to concede
  that teraphim are condemned in these two verses? If so, then on what basis can
  you claim just the opposite for Hosea, where the subject in the opening verse
  [Hosea 3:1] is idolatry?
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill's next email responses of 8 April, 1997.</strong>
  <p>You know, I think your primary defense mechanism in this discourse is to
  write so much crap, that neither I nor anyone else has enough time to pay
  attention to it. You talk about Hebrew texts, as if they are incorruptible;
  like the first century Jews had no reason to change words or erase prophecies.
  What made them so pristine all of a sudden?
  <p>I'll pose my question another way. If teraphim is left AS teraphim in most
  places in the KJV, why did Rachel steal her Father's &quot;images&quot;?
  (which were teraphim in the original)
  <p>And why would the Isrealites FOR MANY DAYS BE WITHOUT, King, Prince,
  sacrifice, altar, ephod and teraphim, unless when their punishment was over,
  all of the above would be restored?
  <p>I told you you're dead, but you're too stubborn to admit that you're wrong.
  <p><em>&gt; A good example is your insistance that the word altar is in the
  text of the Vulgate, yet the word is &quot;tselem&quot; in the Hebrew text,
  which means an idolatrous image.</em>
  <p>Ahhh, so now &quot;images&quot; and teraphim are alongside each other? What
  Jewish text are you reading from anyway? It now makes no sense at all, because
  there's a redundancy.
  <p>By the way, teraphim is a statue. If one worships the statue, it is
  idolatry, and the statues would be &quot;idols&quot;. If one honors the person
  that the statue represents, or in the case of Jesus, worships the person the
  statue represents, it is holy and pleasing to God. But they are both
  &quot;teraphim&quot; either way.
  <p><em>&gt; I doubt you will find a Bible dictionary in print that claims
  teraphim were in any way approved by God.</em>
  <p>Don't bet on it - I've got one.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Bryan Mccahill's newsgroup response of 8 April, 1997.</strong>
  <p><em>&gt; Then that surely applies as well to the notes in your edition of
  the Douay Rheims.</em>
  <p>Correct. There was nothing in the annotations contrary to Catholic
  doctrine.
  <p><em>&gt; The problem you are encountering with sacred pillars may be due to
  your reliance on the Vulgate, which is itself a translation.</em>
  <p>Yes - a translation of the Septaugint, which as you know was translated
  separately by 70 elders from Hebrew to Greek. Do you really think that a
  commonplace word like &quot;altar&quot; could be misunderstood? Why do you
  trust the Hebrew texts? There are no originals there either.
  <p><em>&gt; The word in question in the Hebrew/Chaldee is H6754/5
  &quot;tselem&quot;. Note this prohibition in Leviticus that uses the exact
  same word-
  <p>&nbsp;
  <blockquote>
    &gt; Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols [H3808, eliyl] nor graven image
    [H6754, tselem], neither rear you up a standing image [H4676, matstsebah],
    neither shall ye set up any image [H4906, maskiyth] ] of stone in your land,
    to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.</em>
  <p>&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  I don't give a hoot what the Hebrew text says, or what they say the word
  means.
  <p><em>&gt; So the exact same type of image is found in Hosea 3:4. Note that
  the prohibition in Leviticus is against bowing down before any image, pillar,
  or image of stone (maskiyth = statue or figure) what-so-ever. There are no
  exceptions mentioned.</em>
  <p>Are you now talking about the word &quot;altar&quot;? Are you saying that
  instead of, King, Prince, sacrifice, altar, ephod and teraphim, it should
  read, King, prince, sacrifice image, ephod and teraphim? Now you have a
  redundancy that makes no sense whatsoever!
  <p><em>&gt; Funny thing, the same wording is found in Exodus 20:4. For the
  word graven the word is H6459, &quot;pecel&quot; which is derived from: H6458.
  pacal, paw-sal'; a prim. root; to carve, whether wood or stone:--grave, hew.</em>
  <p>What do you mean the same wording? How is &quot;pecel&quot; the same
  wording as anything you have mentioned before? I think your primary defense is
  to confuse the reader. I told you, the word &quot;pefel&quot; is translated in
  Greek as &quot;idol&quot;, and Latin as &quot;sculptile&quot;. Protestants
  merely chose the word &quot;images&quot; to support their anti-Catholic
  agenda.
  <p><em>&gt; The word for image is H6754, &quot;tselem&quot; which means figure
  or likeness. The prohibition is against carving a statue, a graven image, and
  bowing down to it. I don't quite see the distinction the original Douay is
  trying to make. Isn't sculpting an idol and carving an idol the same thing?
  Interestingly the 1899 revised Douay Rheims take a quite different approach:</em>
  <p>Sculpting an idol and carving an idol are the same thing, yes. But
  sculpting an &quot;image&quot; is not wrong. You can't make the distinction
  between an idol and an image. That's your whole problem. Is a statue of
  Abraham Lincoln an idol?
  <p><em>&gt; Note for Exodus 20:4 - All such images, or likenesses, are

  bowing to any image, without exeception, is strongly prohibited. Yet the
  Catholic Church teaches you to do just that, bow down in front of statues and
  other images!</em>
  <p>Yes, we do - agreed. But what you refuse to understand or accept, is that
  we do not attribute any &quot;power&quot; (for lack of a better word) to the
  image itself. We know what it's made of, and that's all it is. We are bowing
  to the person to whom that picture or statue represents. We also kiss the
  Pope's ring. If you don't like that, then you hardly would have liked seeing
  Jesus wash the feet of the Apostles either.
  <p><em>&gt; Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
  likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
  beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow
  down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God,
  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and
  fourth generation of them that hate me;</em>
  <p>Yawn....haven't we covered this already?
  <p><em>&gt; Since Protestants have no Pope or Magisterium, and any Protestant

  <p>What you'll find out though, is that there is little Church teaching on the
  absolute meaning of scriptural passages. Protestants generally insist on the
  meanings of certain passages. We have a lot of room to argue, as long as the
  opinion does not run flat into the face of Catholic teaching, i.e., as long as
  it is not heretical.
  <p>BAM said: &gt;P.S. and must you be so lengthy?
  <p><em>&gt; When you have the weight of evidence on your side, it is difficult
  not to present it.</em>
  <p>I still think you have not explained my original question. You have beat
  around the bush and run all through the OT. So I'll say it again. How come
  Protestant Bibles translate Rachel's &quot;teraphim&quot; as
  &quot;images&quot;, and in Hosea 3:4 they leave it as &quot;teraphim&quot;? I
  say, because they didn't know what to put there, and din't want anything to
  get in the way of their &quot;no statues&quot; heresy. Secondly, if the
  Israelites were being punished by being deprived of King, prince, sacrifice,
  altar, ephod and teraphim, for many days, indicating that it would not always
  be, then how can &quot;teraphim&quot;, or images, or statues, be categorically
  sinful?
  <p>(still waiting)<br>
  BAM
  <p>&nbsp;
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>Michael Scheifler's response of 8 April 1997:</strong>
  <p>So, in your opinion we cannot trust the Hebrew or Greek texts to be
  accurate?
  <p>I don't see where it makes any difference at all whether the word teraphim
  has been translated images or not. You see an anti-Catholic conspiracy where
  none exists. It seems you are forced into gyrations like this because you
  cannot provide any tangible evidence that teraphim were ever permitted or
  condoned by God.
  <p><em>&gt; And why would the Isrealites FOR MANY DAYS BE WITHOUT, King,
  Prince, sacrifice, altar, ephod and teraphim, unless when their punishment was
  over, all of the above would be restored?</em>
  <p>Perhaps you would like to quote the verse that specifically says sacred
  stones and teraphim will be restored to Israel?
  <p><em>&gt; Ahhh, so now &quot;images&quot; and teraphim are alongside each
  other? What Jewish text are you reading from anyway? It now makes no sense at
  all, because there's a redundancy.</em>
  <p>The Strong's Concordance contains with it a Greek and Hebrew dictionary,
  which I have been quoting from. For example H8655 in Strong's is teraphiym.
  You can get a copy of Strong's from most any bookstore. Strong's lists every
  occurance of the word in the Bible by verse. There are several different types
  of idolatrous images I can think of: figurines, statues, pillars, pictures,
  and engravings, and I expect there are probably words of each type, but they
  could just be interpreted also in a general category of pagan idolatrous
  images. So a verse might look repetative, but it probably is defining
  different categories of pagan images.
  <p><em>&gt; By the way, teraphim is a statue. If one worships the statue, it
  is idolatry, and the statues would be &quot;idols&quot;. If one honors the
  person that the statue represents, or in the case of Jesus, worships the
  person the statue represents, it is holy and pleasing to God. But they are
  both &quot;teraphim&quot; either way.</em>
  <p>So the teraphim in the Bible, based on archeology, were mostly nude female
  figures. Who do you think they were worshipping?
  <p>Where does scripture permit kneeling or bowing in prayer before **any**
  statue at all, no matter who it is of?
  <p>I expect it will be obvious to all non-Catholic readers that you are a
  doctrine in search of Biblical support, no matter how thin, improbable, or
  even preposterous it appears. It is quite clear that you are going to believe
  what your Church teaches no matter what the Bible says on the matter. But, in
  any case, please quote the Bible Dictionary you have that extols the merits
  and virtues of teraphim. In addition to the publisher and author, please
  include the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur information attached to it as well. I
  just might like to get a copy through the local Catholic Bookstore.

  <p><em>&gt; Perhaps you would like to quote the verse that specifically says
  sacred stones and teraphim will be restored to Israel?</em>
  <p>Obviously, this was your only &quot;out&quot;. Since this was a prophecy,
  however, I could easily say that they were restored in the Catholic Church,
  just as the passage from Malachias 1:11 was fulfilled by the Mass.
  <p><em>&gt; So the teraphim in the Bible, based on archeology, were mostly
  nude female figures. Who do you think they were worshipping?</em>
  <p>Nude females, I guess.. and I have admitted that there were certainly
  idols. But not all &quot;teraphim&quot; were worshipped.
  <p><em>&gt; Where does scripture permit kneeling or bowing in prayer before
  **any** statue at all, no matter who it is of?</em>
  <p>Nowhere that I've seen. But the Catholic Church is the &quot;pillar and
  bulwark of truth&quot;. Thus, under the proper conditions (i.e., those that
  were promulgated at the Third Council of Nicea) one can kneel before images.
  By the way, I don't know of any Catholic who remotely believes that any statue
  has any &quot;inherent&quot; power. Just as you may look at a picture of your
  dead grandmother and say a prayer to God, we look at pictures or statues of
  saints and with the same love, ask them to pray for us. Just as a picture
  enkindles the memory of a loved one, a statue or painting can do the same.
  These were the champions of Christianity. Why shouldn't we honor them?
