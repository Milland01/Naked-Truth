      not respond. I don't know if it was zapped into cyberspace, or you don't 
      have a response. I will try again:</p>
      <p>You have had many questions of late about the Roman Church and the 
      Bible as it pertains to the laity. You insist that Rome has never withheld 
      the Bible from the common man, I believe that history speaks against this. 
      For example in 1229 the Council of Valencia put the Bible on the index of 
      Forbidden books stating,&quot; We prohibit also the permitting of the laity, to 
      have the books of the Old and New Testament, unless any one should wish to 
      have a psalter or breviary for divine service...But we strictly forbid the 
      above mentioned books in the vulgar tongue.&quot; The Council of Trent 
      reaffirmed this decree. Clement XI also affirmed this in his Bull 
      Unigenitus in 1713. I believe Leo XII in the 1890's allowed the laity to 
      read the Bible but only the Latin Vulgate and only with permission, and 
      the Pope forbid you try to interpret the Bible by yourself, the laity are 
      not able. Of course they probably couldn't read Latin either. I will grant 
      you that the Bible is and was read in the church, but only by the priest, 
      and than with the Rome's interpretation thereof. That is an argument for 
      another day though. (I thought God sent his Holy Spirit to guide us.) In 
      closing, I don't see how you could say that the Bible has always been 
      available to the Roman lay person. Thanks for your insight. God Bless</font></td>

      <p align="left"><font size="3">Please do not consider any comments here as 
      a personal criticism or attack. However, as has been noted in previous 
      postings, the historical facts and documents themselves simply do not 
      support your contention. Owing to deliberate misinterpretations, 
      mistranslations from the original Latin, or misunderstandings of the papal 
      and conciliar documents, attacks such as the one you note have been made 
      over the years. The reality is quite different.</p>
      <p>I will re-state -- Catholics have not been denied the Scriptures. The 
      documents you cite, further, do not support the contention being made that 
      the Church prevented Catholics from reading the Bible. I will not bore 
      readers with every document mentioned, but I would encourage them to read 
      several previous postings relative to the decrees of Pope Leo XIII. I will 
      offer, by way of example, several paragraphs regarding the Scriptures from 
      Unigenitus of 1713 by Pope Clement XI that is listed above as &quot;proof&quot;: </p>
      <p>&quot;84. To snatch away from the hands of Christians the New Testament, or 
      to hold it closed against them by taking away from them the means of 
      understanding it, is to close for them the mouth of Christ. </p>
      <p>85. To forbid Christians to read Sacred Scripture, especially the 
      Gospels, is to forbid the use of light to the sons of light, and to cause 
      them to suffer a kind of excommunication.&quot; </p>
      <p>I do not think that it can be much clearer than that, and Clement was 
      speaking from traditional and unchanging Church teachings. For anyone who 
      thinks this might be propaganda, I encourage them to read the document for 
      themselves at www.papalencyclicals.net or through EWTN's extensive library 
      resources on-line. </font><br>

      <br>
      The following open letter to you has been posted to my web site at http://biblelight.net/Bible-Clement-XI.htm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      In fairness, I will also post any response of yours to the same page.<p>
      According to the Catholic Encyclopedia online at
      <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15128a.htm">
      http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15128a.htm</a> Unigenitus was:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;A celebrated Apostolic Constitution of Clement XI, condemning 101 
        propositions of Pasquier Quesnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; ... the pope ... in Feb., 
        1712, appointed a special congregation of cardinals and theologians to 
        cull from the work of Quesnel such propositions as were deserving of 
        ecclesiastical censure. ... It took the congregation eighteen months to 
        perform its task, the result of which was the publication of the famous 
        Bull &quot;Unigenitus Dei Filius&quot; at Rome, 8 Sept., 1713. The Bull begins 
        with the warning of Christ against false prophets, especially such as 
        &quot;secretly spread evil doctrines under the guise of piety and introduce 
        ruinous sects under the image of sanctity&quot;; <b>then it proceeds to the 
        condemnation of 101 propositions which are taken verbatim from the last 
        edition of Quesnel's work.</b>&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So the 101 items listed in Unigenitus are direct quotes from Quesnel's 
      work which Pope Clement XI and the church were condemning as <b>ERROR</b>. 
      According to the last paragraph of Unigenitus Dei Filius (the Dogmatic 
      Constitution issued by Pope Clement XI on Sept. 8, 1713 online at
      <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/C11UNIGE.HTM">
      http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/C11UNIGE.HTM</a>) the 101 quoted 
      propositions of Pasquier Quesnel are</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;<i>Declared and condemned</i> as false, captious, evil-sounding, 
        offensive to pious ears, scandalous, pernicious, rash, injurious to the 
        Church and her practice, insulting not only to the Church but also the 
        secular powers seditious, impious, blasphemous, suspected of heresy, and 
        smacking of heresy itself, and, besides, favoring heretics and heresies, 
        and also schisms, erroneous, close to heresy, many times condemned, and 
        finally heretical, clearly renewing many heresies respectively and most 
        especially those which are contained in the infamous propositions of 
        Jansen, and indeed accepted in that sense in which these have been 
        condemned.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So to set the record straight, while Matthew Bunson trumpets Unigenitus 
      as proof positive that the Catholic Church promoted Scripture to the 
      laity, it is in fact the diametric opposite of what he maintains above. It 
      is actually striking proof of the deep-seated enmity the Catholic Church 
      had for Bible reading by laity. The following statements, direct quotes of 
      Pasquier Quesnel the Jansenist heretic, stand condemned in the strongest 
      terms as error by Pope Clement XI in Unigenitus:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>79. It is useful and necessary at all times, in all places, and for 
        every kind of person, to study and to know the spirit, the piety, and 
        the mysteries of Sacred Scripture.<br>
        80. The reading of Sacred Scripture is for all.<br>
        81. The sacred obscurity of the Word of God is no reason for the laity 
        to dispense themselves from reading it.<br>
        82. The Lord's Day ought to be sanctified by Christians with readings of 
        pious works and above all of the Holy Scriptures. It is harmful for a 
        Christian to wish to withdraw from this reading.<br>
        83. It is an illusion to persuade oneself that knowledge of the 
        mysteries of religion should not be communicated to women by the reading 
        of Sacred Scriptures. Not from the simplicity of women, but from the 
        proud knowledge of men has arisen the abuse of the Scriptures and have 
        heresies been born.<br>
        84. To snatch away from the hands of Christians the New Testament, or to 
        hold it closed against them by taking away from them the means of 
        understanding it, is to close for them the mouth of Christ.<br>
        85. To forbid Christians to read Sacred Scripture, especially the 
        Gospels, is to forbid the use of light to the sons of light, and to 
        cause them to suffer a kind of excommunication.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;Here is the note at the end of <b>
      <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/C11UNIGE.HTM">Unigenitus 
      online at EWTN:</a></b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>2. This dogmatic constitution [Unigenitus] was confirmed by the same 
        Clement XI in the Bull &quot;Pastoralis Officii&quot; (Aug. 28, 1718) against the 
        Appellantes, in which he declares that certain Catholics &quot;who did not 
        accept the Bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; were clearly outside the bosom of the Roman 
        Church; by Innocent XIII in a decree published on Jan. 8, 1722; by 
        Benedict XIII and the Roman Synod in 1725; by
        <a href="http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Ben14/b14exomn.htm">Benedict 
        XIV in the encyclical, &quot;Ex omnibus Christiani orbis regionibus&quot; on Oct. 
        16, 1756</a>; it was accepted by the Gallic clergy in assemblies in 
        1723, 1726, 1730, by the councils of Avignon 1725 and Ebred, 1727, and 
        by the whole Catholic world. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So by proposing that any of the above items #79 thru #85 regarding 
      Bible reading are true, Matthew Bunson places himself directly under papal 
      condemnation as a heretic, &quot;clearly outside the bosom of the Roman 
      Church.&quot;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">The text of Unigenitus found on EWTN's web site (to include 
  the two notes), is apparently actually copied from <i>The Sources of Catholic 
  Dogma</i>, Translated by Roy J. Deferrari, published by Marion House, from the 
  Thirtieth Edition of Henry Denzinger's <i>Enchiridion Symbolorum</i>, 
  published by B. Herder Book Co., Copyright 1957, pages 347-354.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Here is what Pope Benedict XIV said about the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>3. The authority of the apostolic constitution which begins with the word
    <i>Unigenitus</i> is certainly so great and lays claim everywhere to such 
    sincere veneration and obedience that no one can withdraw the submission due 
    it or oppose it without risking the loss of eternal salvation.</p>
    <p align="right"><i><font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;</font>
    <a href="http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Ben14/b14exomn.htm">Ex omnibus 
    Christiani orbis regionibus</a></i>, <br>
    Encyclical of Pope Benedict XIV promulgated on October 16, 1756.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So it follows that by contradicting the papal condemnation of 
  items #79 thru #85 of <i>Unigenitus</i>, Matthew Bunson's salvation is at risk 
  of being lost.</p>

    As the Vice President of Theology for EWTN, there is a serious situation
