<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font
  size="4">A</font><font size="2">MONG</font><font size="3"> Protestants there
  is a sublime confidence in truth, a fearless conviction that error will give
  her only an opportunity for fresh victories, a field to display her unequalled
  prowess, and the intrinsic weakness and wickedness of all her enemies. The
  rugged mountain-peak does not try to remove the huge arms of the tempest when,
  in its greatest fury, it embraces it; the ocean may be lashed into gigantic
  billows, towering, in crested and foaming majesty, over its mighty bosom; but
  the sea, as if conscious that the hurricane cannot hurt it, that it will soon
  be as calm and as deep as ever, allows the wind to sport with its waters
  without an effort to resist them. The earth, when vast hosts assemble in
  battle array on her surface, listens to their rattling musketry, their
  thundering artillery, their shrieks, their shouts, the clash and din of arms,
  the trumpet blasts of victory; but she rolls on, as if conscious that their
  struggles, groans and slaughter, cannot injure her; that, in a few months, the
  grass will hide the traces of battle; and, in a few years, if it were not for
  memory or books, not a footprint of savage Mars would be on the scene once
  slippery with blood, and horrible with agony and slaughter. So Protestants,
  judging by their free press and unrestrained speech, feel about their
  principles. They say, <i>in deeds</i>, to papal Christendom, send your monks
  and nuns to attack us, your priests and bishops, your Jesuits, and sisters of
  mercy and charity; send your books and confessional, your logic and your zeal;
  let there be a siege or an assault, a battle on the open plain, or an effort
  at secret slaughter, like the mountain-top, defying the whirlwind, or the
  ocean, despising the furious gale, or the earth, unterrified by the throes and
  roars of the great battle, we hurl defiances in the faces of all; we are so
  sure that our principles will uproot yours, and bathe</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[pg. 351]</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">humanity in the light of saving love,
  that we do not fear your efforts, and would disdain to hinder you from making
  war upon Protestantism. That is the faith and the practice of all great
  centres of evangelical Christianity. The Church of Rome has always acted as if
  she feared for the success of her religion, and whenever she had an
  opportunity, invited the policeman, the prison, confiscation, the rack, the
  flames, the axe, and the halter, to quiet her enemies, and to give
  perseverance to her friends.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Council of Trent, legislation against the freedom of
  the press was introduced by the legates of the Holy See who presided over it,
  and it was referred by them to a committee. The subject was called: &quot;The
  Business of the Books, Censures, and Index.&quot; The committee consisted of
  &quot;The Embassador of Hungary, the Patriarch of Venice, four Archbishops,
  nine bishops, one abbot, and two generals&quot; (of religious orders).*</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Decree of the
  Council about this Committee.</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; The sacred
  and holy synod, in the second session, celebrated under our most holy lord,
  Plus IV., entrusted to certain chosen fathers, to consider what ought to be
  done about various censures and books, either suspected or pernicious, to
  report to the holy synod itself. Hearing now that the last hand has been put
  to that labor by them, which, however, cannot be distinctly and advantageously
  decided by the holy synod, on account of the variety and multitude of the
  books, it orders that, whatever has been done by them, may be shown to the
  most holy Roman Pontiff, that it may be settled and published by his decision
  and authority. And it commands that the same should be done about the
  Catechism by the fathers to whom that question was entrusted, and about the
  Missal and Breviary.&quot; †<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One very important work of this committee was the
  preparation of the Catechism of the Council of Trent, which was originally
  published three years after the dissolution of that synod by command of Pius
  V. It is a work of five hundred pages, prepared with</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">* Sarpi, p. 477. London, 1629.<br>
  † De Indice Libr. et Catech, sess. xxv. p. 205, Canones et Decreta Con. Trid.&nbsp;
  Lipsiae, 1863.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[pg. 352]</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">singular ability, and it presents the
  most complete view of Catholic doctrine and practices in existence. Of course,
  its statements bear the impress of the highest authority.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weightiest business with which this committee was
  charged was the duty of looking after books doubtful or dangerous in the
  judgment of the Catholic hierarchy; it framed TEN RULES for prohibited books,
  which were published with the approval of the pope, and which have been the
  laws of the Catholic Church ever since.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">THE PAPAL ENACTMENTS
  DESIGNED TO KEEP CATHOLICS IGNORANT.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first rule
  condemns all books censured by popes or councils before A. D. 1515.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second condemns the works of all arch-heretics and
  minor terrorists since A. D. 1515; it, however, permits books of the latter
  class of authors on secular subjects, and books of Catholic writers who have
  fallen into heresy, after examination by a Romish university or general
  inquisition, to be read.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third permits the Old Testament, <i>at the discretion
  of the bishop</i>, to learned and pious men. But versions of the New Testament
  made by authors of the first class of this index shall be permitted to no one.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth prohibits the reading of the Bible in the vulgar
  tongue (no matter in what version), unless when a bishop or inquisitor, on the
  recommendation of a confessor, grants the privilege; and it ordains heavy
  penalties against those who sell or read it. Even monks must not search the
  Scriptures without the permission of their superiors.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth permits lexicons, and similar works, from
  heretical authors, after being duly expurgated, to be read.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth permits books on practical religion to be read by
  the faithful in their own tongue; but forbids the perusal of controversial
  books, except when permitted by a bishop or inquisitor on the advice of a
  confessor.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seventh forbids the use of all indecent books except
  the ancient classics, and it permits these with restrictions.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[pg. 353]</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eighth permits
  the use of books whose general sentiment is good, after purification by the
  Catholic authorities.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ninth forbids the use of all books on magic,
  necromancy, and kindred subjects.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tenth aims at</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
  LIBERTY OF THE PRESS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It reads: * &quot;
  Wherefore, if, in the noble city of Rome, any book is to be printed, let it be
  first examined by the vicar of the supreme pontiff, and the master of the
  sacred palace, or by persons appointed by our most holy lord. But in other
  places, let its examination and approval belong to the bishop, or to another
  having knowledge of the book or writing to be printed, such person to be
  appointed by the same bishop, and an inquisitor of heretical depravity, of
  that state or diocese in which the printing will be executed, and let it be
  approved by their hand, to be imposed by their subscription gratuitously, and
  without delay, under the punishments and censures contained in the same
  decree, with the addition of this law and condition, that an authentic copy of
  the work to be printed, subscribed by the author, shall remain with the
  examiner; but the deputed fathers judge that those who issue manuscript works,
  unless they are first examined and approved, should be subjected to the same
  penalties as the printers: and they who retain and read them should be held as
  the authors unless they give up the authors. But let the approbation itself be
  given in writing,</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">* — Canones et Decreta Conc. Trid., Regula
  x., De Lib. Prohib., pp. 235-6. Lipsiae, 1863.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[pg. 354]</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">and let it appear authentically in
  the front of the book, whether manuscript or printed; and let the proving and
  examination, and all the rest, be attended to gratuitously. Moreover, in the
  several states and dioceses, let the houses or places where printing is
  performed, and libraries of books are for sale, be frequently visited by
  persons deputed for that object by the bishop, or by his vicar, and also by
  the inquisitor of heretical depravity, that none of the prohibited things may
  be printed, sold, or kept. Let all librarians and booksellers have in their
  libraries a catalogue of the books for sale which they keep, with the
  subscription of said persons. And let them keep or sell no other books, or by
  any means deliver them, without the license of the same deputies, under the
  penalty of the confiscation of the books, or other punishments <i>to be
  inflicted at the discretion of the bishops or inquisitors. And let the buyers,
  readers, and printers be punished at the discretion of the same.</i> But if
  any persons introduce any books whatsoever into any state, let them be bound
  to report them to the same deputies; or, if a public place has been appointed
  for such wares, let the public servants of that place signify to the persons
  aforesaid that books have been brought. Let no one dare to deliver a book
  which he himself or another has introduced into a state, to any one to read,
  or by any means to transfer or lend it, unless the book has first been shown,
  and a</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[pg. 355]</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">license obtained from the deputies,
  or unless it is notoriously clear that the book is now permitted to all. Let
  the same thing also be done by heirs and executors of last wills, that they
  may present the books left by the departed, or a catalogue of them, to those
  deputies, and obtain a license from them, before they use them, or in any way
  transfer them to other persons. But in all and each of these particulars, let
  the punishment be fixed either by the loss of the books, or by some other
  pains, at the discretion of the same bishops or inquisitors, according to the
  character of the contumacy or the crime. . . . . . In conclusion, it is
  enjoined upon all the faithful, that no one presume, against the authority of
  these rules, or the prohibition of this index, to retain or read any books.
  But if any one shall keep or read the books of heretics, or the writings of
  any author condemned and prohibited for heresy, or for the suspicion of a
  false dogma, let him immediately incur the sentence of excommunication. But he
  who shall read or keep books interdicted on any other account, besides the
  guilt of mortal sin, with which he is affected, let him be <i>punished
  severely at the discretion of the bishop.&quot;</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pius IV., entering with his whole heart into the oppressive
  spirit which governed the Council of Trent in most of its decrees, after
  reading these ten rules, and submitting them for examination to some learned
  men, sent them forth with his approbation in a bull eulogistic of their tenor
  and claims, in which he says: * &quot;By our apostolic authority, we approve,
  by these presents, the index</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">* — Pius IV., <i>Ad Futuram Rei Memoriam</i>,
  p. 237, <i>Canones et Decreta. Conc. Trid</i>.&nbsp; Lipsiae, 1862.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[pg. 356]</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">itself, together with the rules
  prefixed to it; and we command and decree that it be printed and published,
  and that it be received everywhere by all Catholic universities, and by every
  one whatsoever; and that these rules be observed; prohibiting each and all, as
  well ecclesiastics, secular and regular, of every grade, order and dignity, as
  laymen, no matter what their honor and dignity, that no one may dare to keep
  or read any books contrary to the command of these rules, and the prohibition
  of the index itself.&quot;&nbsp; This bull was issued on the 24th of March,
  1564, and is binding on all Catholics, and on the whole Protestant world at
  this moment. No canon about the mass stands more defiantly on the statute book
  of Rome than the decree of Pope Pius, giving validity to these rules. There is
  no likelihood of their repeal; such an act would declare infallibility to be
  liable to grave mistakes, and have a tendency to overturn the whole pyramid of
  papal pretensions. But Rome seeks no change. The Church of the popes to-day,
  in the principles of those who dictate her great movements, is of one mind
  with Pius IV. and the fathers of Trent, and would, if she had the opportunity,
  chain the flashes of human genius, the imperial mountain-billows of that
  intellect which only God can imprison or guide.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tenth rule prohibits the circulation of all printed
  matter, and even manuscript works, unless permitted by a Catholic bishop or
  inquisitor, or their deputies, on pain of losing the books, and of enduring <i>any
  other punishment the bishop or the inquisitor may choose to inflict.</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It places the literature of the world in the hands of men
  who thrust Galileo into the inquisition for his astronomical doctrines, and
  compelled him to deny that the earth moves, and who have the greatest jealousy
  of all light; who, if they had power, would restore the blindness of the dark
  ages, and perpetuate its ignorance and tyranny till the blasts of the last
  trumpet awoke the dead.</font></p>
