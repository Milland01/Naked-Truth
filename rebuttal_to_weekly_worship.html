          essay entitled &quot;<a href="notsun.html">Sunday is NOT the Biblical
          Sabbath Day</a>,&quot; writes: &quot;Nowhere in the Bible is Sunday
          blessed, sanctified or commanded by God as a day of weekly

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">
          <p align="left">Perhaps Mr. Scheifler ought to take another peek at
          his Bible to review the question as to how God sanctifies or makes
          holy. God does so by putting His Spirit into the object to be
          sanctified. Speaking of the wilderness tabernacle, God said, &quot;And
          there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle
          shall be sanctified by my glory&quot; (Exodus 29:43). God literally
          came into the sanctuary tent, revealing His presence through the
          Shekinah. Something becomes holy because of God's presence. For
          example, the ground near the burning bush was holy because God was
          there, literally present (Exodus 3:5).
          <p align="left">If we look at the New Testament, Jesus Himself tells
          us that &quot;Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I
          in the midst of them&quot; (Matthew 18:20).
          <p align="left">Whenever Catholics gather in Christ's name--whether
          they do so on a Sunday; whether they do so on a Saturday; or whether
          they do so on any other day of the week--Christ has promised to be
          there. Since He is there, then by His very Presence He is sanctifying
          that time.
          <p align="left">Seventh-Day Adventists have built a whole house of
          cards that says holy time--sanctified time--only occurs once a week,
          but this is not the teaching of Our Lord who promised to be with us <i>whenever</i>
          we gather in His name--not just on Saturday.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>A rather prominent Catholic Cardinal is on record as disagreeing with the
  above premise:</p>
  <p><b><u>Cardinal Gibbons on Sunday</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;... is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday and to
    abstain on that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of
    this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But, you may read
    the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line
    authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the
    religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.&quot;</p>
  <p>Source: <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <em><a
  href="faith-of-our-fathers.gif"><b>The Faith of Our Fathers</b></a></em>, by
  James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, 88th edition, page 89.
  Originally published in 1876, republished and Copyright 1980 by TAN Books and
  Publishers, Inc., pages 72-73.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now if gathering for worship on any day sanctified it, then Cardinal
  Gibbons would not have said that Catholics never sanctify Saturday. It would
  seem that Cardinal Gibbons equates a sanctified day with what Catholics call a
  holy day of obligation, a day commanded to be observed as a holy day by the
  Catholic Church. Sundays are holy days of obligation for Catholics, Saturdays
  are not. So Cardinal Gibbons went on record over 125 years ago as saying that the
  Bible in no way authorizes the sanctification of Sunday. Sunday sacredness is
  only a tradition of men, not commanded in scripture.</p>
  <p align="left">However, I totally agree with Matthew 18:20, that when two or
  three are gathered in Christ's name, he is truly present:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mat 18:20 <font color="#FF0000">For where two or three are
    gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">This can obviously occur at any time, and anywhere, with any
  group of believers. It is worth noting that this means that no Roman Catholic
  priest is necessary, nor must Mass be celebrated, for Christ to be present in
  a very real way. But any such gathering does not sanctify the day of the week
  it occurs on, and does not make that day binding on anyone else as a sabbath
  day of rest and worship.</p>

  <p align="left">God Himself sanctified only one day in the week, the Saturday
  Sabbath, it is not an either/or situation:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
    because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and
    made.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The above verse is the one and only time in all of scripture
  that a day of the week is blessed and sanctified by God as a sabbath day, and
  that day is the seventh day of the week, which we refer to today as Saturday.
  Sunday, the first day of the week, has no such blessing from God anywhere in
  scripture.</p>

  <p align="left">There is no objection from Adventism to worship services held
  on any day of the week, or every day of the week. However, the one and <i>only</i>
  day of the week God set aside and commanded as a day of rest and worship for
  mankind was the seventh-day Saturday sabbath.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#FFFFEA">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">Sunday is merely the &quot;formal day of worship,&quot;
          on which everyone must come to God's house and attend the Mass (cf.
          Hebrews 10:25) in order to fulfill the God's Third Commandment. It is
          a day set apart from the others. A day that is especially holy.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p align="left">The Catholic Church declares Sunday a holy day of obligation,
  that it is a mortal sin to not participate in the Mass on Sunday. This the
  Catholic Church does only on the basis of the Tradition of men, for there is
  no such &quot;Thus saith the Lord&quot; declaring the first day of the week to
  be blessed and sanctified as a day of rest and worship. But there is such a
  decree from the Lord regarding the seventh day of the week:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
    that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
    sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Now, it should be evident that there is simply no way to keep
  the seventh-day Saturday sabbath on the first day of the week, Sunday.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#FFFFEA">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">
          <p align="left">Perhaps Adventists will heed the inspired words of
          Saint Paul:
          <blockquote>
            <p>One judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day.
            Let every man abound in his own sense. He that regardeth the day
            regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth eateth to the Lord:
            for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he
            eateth not and giveth thanks to God. For none of us liveth to
            himself: and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live
            unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore,
            whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's. For to this
            end Christ died and rose again: that he might be Lord both of the
            dead and of the living.</p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;<b>(Romans 14:5-9)</b>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left">Seventh-Day Adventists attempt to create a stumbling
          block to those who worship in honor of the Lord on Sunday, whereas St.
          Paul clearly shows, per the above quote, that the festival days of the
          Old Law have been abrogated and are now obsolete.</td>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rom 14:5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another
    esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.<br>
    Rom 14:6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that
    regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth,
    eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the
    Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.<br>
    Rom 14:7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.<br>
    Rom 14:8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we
    die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">In context, Romans 14 is dealing with fasting or not fasting
  on certain days. It is not discussing whether or not a believer can dispense
  with a commandment of God, or choose to observe the sabbath day on another day
  of one's own choosing. Paul himself was a sabbath keeper who knew nothing of
  Sunday sacredness.<br>

          (Matthew 12:8; Mark 2:28; etc.), has given His Church the authority to

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">The Church, indeed the Living Body of Christ, has, for

          &quot;On the first day of the week, . . . we were assembled to break

    temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with
    gladness and singleness of heart,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">This seems to indicate &quot;breaking bread&quot; to be
  nothing more than agape meals of fellowship, not a formal service with
  communion, so Acts 20:7 does not show that Sunday was anything special as a
  day of worship to the Apostles.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#FFFFEA">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">Thus, Saturday is certainly not enforced as the
          official day of rest for Christians, as the Sabbath of the New Law.
          Seventh-Day Adventists, therefore, are wrong in insisting that the
          principal day of rest for Christians is Saturday. They either admit
          this and join the Bride of Christ, or they continue their heresies and
          better start getting ready for Judgment Day.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>The seventh day Saturday sabbath is a Commandment of God, which He enjoins
  us to remember to keep holy in Exodus 20:8. None of the Ten Commandments have
  been done away with or altered:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 5:18 <font color="#FF0000">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and
    earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till
    all be fulfilled.</font><br>
    Mat 5:19 <font color="#FF0000">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these
    least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
    the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall
    be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The New Testament is quite clear regarding&nbsp; the <i>keeping</i> of the
  Commandments of God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 19:17 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
    good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
    commandments.<br>
    <br>
    John 14:15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.<br>
    <br>
    John 15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I
    have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.<br>
    <br>
    1 John 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
    commandments.<br>
    1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
    liar, and the truth is not in him.<br>
    1 John 2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
    perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.<br>
    <br>
    1 John 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
    commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<br>
    <br>
    1 John 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
    God, and keep his commandments.<br>
    1 John 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and
    his commandments are not grievous.<br>
    <br>
    Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with
    the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
    testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However, on the the keeping of Sunday as a holy day to honor the
  resurrection, the Bible is quite silent.</p>
