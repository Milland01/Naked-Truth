  Hughes</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font color="#000000">Dr. Herschel Hughes, </font>a former professor at 
  Loma Linda University, Riverside, and current member of Loma Linda University 
  SDA Church, has apparently spoken recently at some Adventist churches in southern California, and 
  delivered what he claims is a message from Jesus for the Seventh Day Adventist 
  church. In this message, he repudiates the SDA teachings regarding the 
  Sabbath, the state of the dead, the pre-advent investigative judgment, hell, and 
  end time prophecy. This comes at the end of his brief 30 minute talk, and is 
  apparently sprung on an unwitting congregation, before there is time to react 
  and remove him from the pulpit. In my opinion, it is not Jesus, but Satan, 
  that is speaking through Dr. Hughes. </p>
  <p><font color="#000000">The following is a transcript of the message 
  allegedly from Jesus to the SDA church (times listed are from the
  <a href="http://www.amessagefromgodtothesdachurch.com/audio/SDA Message.mp3">mp3</a> file available from his 
  <a href="http://www.amessagefromgodtothesdachurch.com/">web site</a>):</font></p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">23:45<p>I am the Lord thy God, and those of you from the Seventh Day Adventist 
  Church are dearly loved by me, but you are a stiff-necked prideful people who 
  have provoked my wrath. For I have sent to you many messengers of truth but 
  you have stubbornly refused to respond to their testimony, and you are 
  arrogantly continuing to defy my will. </p>
  <p>24:21</p>
  <p>The end is near, so I give you this final warning, you <i>must</i> return 
  to your Christian roots, and abandon the false teaching that it is my will 
  that you should observe and make the Jewish sabbath the focus of end time 
  events, and an issue of salvation. This is wrong, for the sabbath was part of 
  the old covenant I made exclusively for the Jews, and as Gentiles it's not 
  yours to claim. But I have given all people, Jews and Gentiles alike, who 
  believe and follow me, a new covenant, which is the inheritance of eternal 
  life, freely given by my blood, and by my grace through faith, and which also 
  includes the guidance and empowerment of my spirit, but it includes no 
  allowance for any legalisms from the old Jewish covenant. My Jews celebrate my 
  creation, but my Christians celebrate my blood. </p>
  <p>25:40</p>
  <p>You must also abandon the false teaching that you call the investigative 
  judgment, as it <i>denies</i> the completed redemption of my cross. It denies 
  my grace and without my grace there is no salvation. </p>
  <p>You must reject your false views about death as I am the creator of life 
  and the immortality of the soul, and at the moment of death, I call home to be 
  with me all the souls of my true believers.</p>
  <p>You must embrace my truth regarding the indwelling work of my holy spirit 
  which begins at the moment you are born again and you are sealed by me.</p>
  <p>26:31</p>
  <p>You have scorned my rapture throughout your entire brief existence as a 
  church, and thus you have chosen not to be included in it.</p>
  <p>You have altered my truths regarding this earth's final events, so that 
  your people will not be prepared for my coming. And you deceived my Christians 
  with you heretical Sunday laws and mark of the beast deceptions.</p>
  <p>You teach contempt and condemnation toward my Jews, and you claim to have 
  replaced them and call yourselves spiritual Israel. Such thinking led to the 
  tortuous murder of millions of my chosen people, for <i>they</i> will be 
  restored, and <i>they </i>not you, will do my work during the tribulation.</p>
  <p>27:28</p>
  <p>There is a judgment of fire for all people who have demeaned my Jews. And 
  you have even altered my truth of eternal damnation.</p>
  <p>I will no longer tolerate these and other of your heresies. You are not my 
  remnant church or my chosen people, and most of you are not even part of the 
  body of Christ. I want to anoint and empower this church. Do not remain a 
  cult. You must reject these untruths and become a genuine Christian church <i>
  now</i>, the Adventist Christian church. </p>
  <p>You have the potential of becoming a mighty force for my cause, but you 
  have chosen to follow a false prophet, who is leading you to your own demise. 
  Harken my words before it is too late. Repent, Repent, Repent, and follow only 
  me and I will abundantly bless you. Otherwise, I will ultimately focus my 
  wrath at the tribulation against this church and its people.</p>
