and the State of the Dead.</font></p>
</center><hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>When discussing the state of the dead, that the dead are really dead and 
  not in heaven, hell, or purgatory, the case of the Witch of Endor may be 
  presented as proof that people don't really die, that they continue in some 
  conscious state even after death. So let's examine what happened regarding 
  King Saul and the Witch of Endor.</p>
  <p>King Saul was given very explicit instructions by God through the prophet 
  Samuel::</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to 
    be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the 
    voice of the words of the LORD.<br>
    1 Sam 15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to 
    Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.<br>
    1 Sam 15:3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, 
    and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and 
    sheep, camel and ass.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, just what did King Saul do? Did he follow God's instructions?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest 
    to Shur, that is over against Egypt.<br>
    1 Sam 15:8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly 
    destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.<br>
    1 Sam 15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, 
    and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, 
    and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and 
    refuse, that they destroyed utterly.<br>
    1 Sam 15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,<br>
    1 Sam 15:11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is 
    turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And 
    it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>King Saul disobeyed God. He spared the King of the Amalekites and the 
  finest of the animals in direct opposition to the command of God. Now when 
  Samuel confronted Saul, note what Saul said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be 
    thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Saul had the temerity to tell Samuel that he had done <i>exactly</i> as 
  commanded by God! But Samuel knew better than that, after all, he had give 
  Saul the instructions from God in the first place. So Samuel asks:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep 
    in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</p>
    <p>1 Sam 15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but 
    didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Saul, his disobedience now exposed, actually tries to blame the people for 
  his actions:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of 
    the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought 
    Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.<br>
    1 Sam 15:21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of 
    the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the 
    LORD thy God in Gilgal.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note how Samuel characterizes Saul's disobedience:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt 
    offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to 
    obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.<br>
    1 Sam 15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is 
    as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, 
    he hath also rejected thee from being king.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Saul's transgression was of so great a magnitude that God was removing him 
  as King of Israel, even though Saul then admitted his sin:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have 
    transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared 
    the people, and obeyed their voice.<br>
    1 Sam 15:25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with 
    me, that I may worship the LORD.<br>
    1 Sam 15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou 
    hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from 
    being king over Israel.<br>
    1 Sam 15:27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the 
    skirt of his mantle, and it rent.<br>
    1 Sam 15:28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of 
    Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that 
    is better than thou.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>After slaying Agag, Samuel departed from Saul, and never returned, even to 
  the day Samuel died:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his 
    death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he 
    had made Saul king over Israel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In fact, the spirit of God departed from Saul completely. God no longer 
  spoke to Saul:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 16:14 But the spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil 
    spirit from the LORD troubled him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then later, the elderly Samuel died:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 25:1 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered 
    together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, now when faced by an enemy, Saul was no longer hearing from God or his 
  prophets:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and 
    pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched 
    in Gilboa.<br>
    1 Sam 28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and 
    his heart greatly trembled.<br>
    1 Sam 28:6 And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, 
    neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So who does Saul seek council from? Who does he seek to tell him what he 
  must do?</p>
  <p align="center"><u><font size="5"><b>Seeking After</b></font><b><font size="5"> 
  A Familiar Spirit</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a 
    familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants 
    said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God strongly condemned in scripture what Saul was going to do:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a 
    wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: 
    their blood shall be upon them.</p>
    <p>Deu 18:10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son 
    or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an 
    observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,<br>
    Deu 18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, 
    or a necromancer.<br>
    Deu 18:12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and 
    because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from 
    before thee.<br>
    Deu 18:13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.<br>
    Deu 18:14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto 
    observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God 
    hath not suffered thee so to do.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, knowing that God condemned it, Saul still went to consult with a witch, 
  a spirit medium and a necromancer (one who claims to consult with the dead).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:8 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he 
    went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he 
    said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him 
    up, whom I shall name unto thee.<br>
    1 Sam 28:9 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath 
    done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, 
    out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me 
    to die?<br>
    1 Sam 28:10 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, 
    there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.<br>
    1 Sam 28:11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he 
    said, Bring me up Samuel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, consider an important point. Was the witch to summon the spirit of 
  Samuel down from heaven? No. Saul knew the state of the dead, that Samuel was 
  dead in the grave. He was actually asking the witch to call Samuel <i>up from 
  the grave</i>, not down from heaven. </p>
  <p>Note also that God was no longer speaking to Saul, and God's prophets were 
  not speaking with Saul (1 Sam 28:6). So now, are we to believe that a witch 
  was going to thwart the will of God by conjuring up Samuel from the grave, so 
  that Saul could speak with a prophet of God, against the explicit will of God? 
  No witch could do such a thing. </p>
  <p>Remember also, the witch at Endor was known for having a familiar spirit. 
  What is a familiar spirit anyway? It is <i>not</i> an angel of God, surely, 
  because of God's strong condemnation against consulting with them. A familiar 
  spirit is a demonic spirit, a fallen angel in league with Satan. This is what 
  the woman at Endor had, communication with a demon, a demon who was quite 
  capable of impersonating Samuel. It was NOT Samuel who appeared at her 
  summons, it was a demon masquerading as Samuel. The first thing that the demon 
  did was expose Saul's masquerade to the witch:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: 
    and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art 
    Saul.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now exposed to the witch, Saul continues to consult her:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest 
    thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.<br>
    1 Sam 28:14 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old 
    man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it 
    was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that Saul did not actually see anything himself, he had to ask the 
  witch who is was that she saw. So based on what the witch said, Saul <i>
  presumed</i> it was Samuel who he was communicating with, that Samuel had been 
  summoned from the grave to speak with him, since the witch said she could see 
  Samuel coming up from out of the earth (not down from heaven). King Saul was 
  putting his trust completely in a spirit medium, a witch, a necromancer, 
  against the expressed will of God. So the following conversation was not 
  between Saul and Samuel, but between Saul and a witch with a familiar 
  (demonic) spirit:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to 
    bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines 
    make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, 
    neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou 
    mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again, note that Samuel is represented as <i>coming up </i>from the grave, 
  not <i>down</i> from heaven. Saul also affirms that he knows that God refuses 
  to communicate with him any more <i>by any means</i>, yet he expected to get 
  guidance from a dead prophet of God via a familiar (demonic) spirit. The 
  counsel Saul gets predicts the defeat of Israel and his imminent death, along 
  with his sons:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 28:16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing 
    the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?<br>
    1 Sam 28:17 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD 
    hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even 
    to David:<br>
    1 Sam 28:18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst 
    his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto 
    thee this day.<br>
    1 Sam 28:19 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the 
    hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: 
    the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the 
    Philistines.<br>
    1 Sam 28:20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore 
    afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; 
    for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Conclusion</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>King Saul was looking for help from the witch of Endor, to contact someone 
  in the grave, a dead Samuel, so that he could know from God how he could gain 
  a victory over the Philistines. But God was not talking to Saul any more. By 
  knowing what the Bible teaches about the state of the dead, <i>and</i> the 
  circumstances regarding Saul's relationship with God at the time, we can be 
  quite certain that it was <i>not</i> actually Samuel raised from the dead 
  speaking to him, but a fallen angel, a demonic spirit. That Saul even 
  attempted this séance with a spirit medium (witch) was an abomination, a 
  further rebellion against God, and Saul paid for his rebellion with his life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Chr 10:13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against 
    the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for 
    asking <i>counsel</i> of <i>one that had</i> a familiar spirit, to inquire 
    <i>of it</i>;<br>
    1 Chr 10:14 And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned 
    the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>The words in italics in verse 13 are supplied by the translator, as they 
    are not in the original text. So if you drop those words, it reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, 
    even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking of a familiar spirit, to inquire;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the passage above clearly states, Saul communicated with a demonic 
  spirit, <i>not</i> Samuel.</p>
