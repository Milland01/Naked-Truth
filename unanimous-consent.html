  </blockquote>
  <p>Here in the decrees of <i>two</i> infallible councils of the Roman Catholic 
  Church, and sworn to in a profession of faith, there is a most solemn 
  proscription against interpreting Sacred Scripture contrary to Mother Church, 
  or &quot;the unanimous consent of the Fathers&quot;. There are absolutely no exceptions 
  allowed in the prohibition, and all transgressors are subject to punishment 
  under ecclesiastical law. The Catholic rule then, is if you want to know what 
  the Bible really teaches with certainty, you <u>must</u> consult the teachings 
  of the Roman Catholic Church <i>and</i> &quot;the unanimous consent of the 
  Fathers&quot;, and they will always be right, which is to say the Bible is utterly 
  incapable of clearly revealing the truth to you without the aid of the Church.</p>
  <p>Could anything be more clear cut than the decrees of Trent and Vatican I? 
  No one may <i>ever</i> contradict the biblical interpretations of the Roman 
  Catholic Church, or the biblical interpretations of Church Fathers (where, 
  allegedly, there is unanimous consent), even if, according to the Council of 
  Trent, there may be no intent on the part of the Roman Catholic Church to ever<i>
  </i>publish them for public reading. This prompts some pertinent questions.</p>
  <p>Has the Roman Catholic Church Magisterium ever published, in any language, 
  an official Catholic Bible commentary, in order that their authoritative Bible 
  interpretations might be made known to the faithful? No. Neither has the 
  intent to publish an official magisterial commentary ever been announced by 
  the Roman Catholic Church. To be sure, you can find Catholic Bible 
  commentaries in Catholic bookstores, but these do not carry the authority of 
  the Church with them, since they are not official magisterial documents. 
  Almost anything that these private commentaries teach could conceivably be 
  disowned and renounced by the Church as being in error, mere private 
  speculations, and of no authority at all.</p>
  <p>Next, has the Roman Catholic Church ever authoritatively and exactly 
  defined just what body of authors make up the church &quot;Fathers&quot; that must, <i>
  without exception</i>, all agree with &quot;unanimous consent&quot; on <i>any</i> 
  interpretation of <i>any</i> verse in the Bible? Note what one Pope has said 
  regarding the relative degree of authority with which the Church and the 
  &quot;Fathers&quot; allegedly speak:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="3"><i>Holy Scripture and Theology; 
    Interpretation; the Fathers</i></font></b></p>
    <p>14. ...&nbsp; <font size="3">Catholic doctrine, as authoritatively 
    proposed by the Church, should be held as the supreme law; for, seeing that 
    the same God is the author both of the Sacred Books and of the doctrine 
    committed to the Church, it is clearly impossible that any teaching can by 
    legitimate means be extracted from the former, which shall in any respect be 
    at variance with the</font><i><font face="Courier New" size="1"> </font></i>
    <font size="3">latter. Hence it follows that all interpretation is foolish 
    and false which either makes the sacred writers disagree one with another, 
    or is opposed to the doctrine of the Church. ... The Holy Fathers &quot;to whom, 
    after the Apostles, the Church owes its growth-who have planted, watered, 
    built, governed, and cherished it,&quot;(39) <b>the Holy Fathers, We say, are of 
    supreme authority, whenever they all interpret in one and the same manner 
    any text of the Bible, as pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals; for 
    their unanimity clearly evinces that such interpretation has come down from 
    the Apostles as a matter of Catholic faith.</b></font></p>

    emphasis added)</font></span><font size="3">.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Leo XIII is saying that any Bible interpretation that conflicts with 
  doctrinal teachings of the Church, or the Holy Fathers, is both &quot;foolish and 
  false&quot;. Just who, precisely, is included in this august group of supremely 
  authoritative Holy Fathers, and who is excluded? Are there 10 men in this 
  authoritative group that need to be consulted regarding the meaning of the 
  Bible, or 50, or maybe 100 or more such men? We cannot tell, for Rome has <i>
  never</i> authoritatively and specifically defined just who all the &quot;Holy 
  Fathers&quot; are that absolutely<i> must</i> give their unanimous consent to all 
  Bible interpretations in order to ascertain their validity. Without a formal 
  definition from Rome, the rule is impossible to apply coherently.</p>
  <p>Just to illustrate the immensity of the task, pick any 5 verses in the 
  Bible, and then (here is the hard part) consult <i>every</i> writing of every 
  alleged &quot;Church Father&quot; for their interpretations, to find all those Fathers 
  who express the exact same understanding of those 5 verses, and thereby embody 
  a &quot;unanimous consent&quot; in their interpretation. Then, for the next step, pick 
  another 5 verses from the Bible, and see if the previously unanimous church 
  fathers still interpret the second set of verses identically. Then repeat the 
  process with another 5 verses, and another 5 verses, until the Bible is 
  exhausted. Is there any group of Holy Church Fathers that could withstand this 
  test repeatedly, and maintain a &quot;unanimous consent&quot; on their interpretations 
  of the Bible? If not, then the &quot;unanimous consent of the Fathers&quot; is an 
  obviously unworkable concept, which explains why it has never been defined, 
  demonstrated, or proved by the Roman Catholic Church. It simply cannot be 
  done, despite being decreed by Trent and confirmed by Vatican I. Interestingly 
  enough, the recent <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, published in 1994 
  by the Vatican, has apparently abandoned &quot;the unanimous consent of the 
  Fathers&quot;, as the phrase does not appear anywhere in its pages regarding Bible 
  interpretation. </p>
  <p>For example, if you wanted to know the authentic authoritative Catholic 
  interpretation of the 7th chapter of Daniel, what would you have to read? 
  According to Trent and Vatican I you would need to know the &quot;unanimous consent 
  of the Fathers&quot; on Daniel 7. That would require consulting all the writings of 
  the theologians, Doctors of the Church, Popes, and Councils for the last 2000 
  years that have commented on Daniel 7, despite the fact that it may only be in 
  Latin, never translated to any other language or officially published by the 
  Church. But how would you know which fathers wrote on Daniel 7, that 
  constitute the authentic Catholic interpretation, recognized officially by the 
  Magisterium? There is no such authoritative resource available to determine 
  this. Since the Roman Catholic Church has never published an authoritative 
  Bible commentary in any language in the 2000 years of its existence, and has 
  never defined exactly who the &quot;Fathers&quot; are that embody and express the 
  &quot;unanimous consent&quot; needed to correctly interpret the Bible, or officially 
  published their works, one can only conclude that the Roman Catholic Church 
  likely has no intention of ever doing so, for reasons that I believe are quite 
  apparent. The Bible, therefore, will apparently remain largely unintelligible 
  and uninterpreted by the Roman Catholic Church, since no one who reads the 
  Bible can ever really know, or discover with any certainty, what 
  interpretation is the official interpretation of the Roman Catholic Church as 
  expressed by the &quot;unanimous consent of the Fathers&quot;, <i>since we know not who 
  they are.</i></p>
  <p>Apologists for the Roman Catholic Church will generally agree that only a 
  mere handful of verses have ever been officially interpreted with magisterial 
  authority, and even on this there is no consensus that can be discovered as to 
  the exact number of such verses, and which ones are to be included. Yet, the 
  Council of Trent says that uncertainty does <i>not</i> impede the Church from 
  prosecuting those who contradict the official interpretations, published or 
  not. What they were (and are) actually trying to say is the Roman Catholic 
  Church is always right, however they interpret the Bible, and no one on the 
  face of the Earth has the authority to contradict them<font

    <p>We know it is the practice of the warm defenders of the popish system to 
    reject the sentiments of their best divines when pressed in argument by 
    Protestants. When they teach their own people, then every thing called Roman 
    Catholic is harmonious and one. But when heretics or Protestants are to be 
    met, then uncertainty reigns in every sentiment uttered by every one of 
    their divines. In the latter case Du Pin becomes traitor to Rome; the French 
    were never true Catholics; Baronius was no pope; Bellarmine drew on himself, 
    in some respects, the censure of the apostolic see; Dens' theology, though 
    the principal text book of their modern schools, contains many things for 
    which modern Catholics are not accountable. Or at any rate, as Dr. Milner 
    teaches, &quot;Protestants have no right to read or expound Scripture, and, 
    therefore, they must be wrong.&quot; This is a decisive argument indeed.</p>
    <p>XII. GENERAL REMARKS ON THEIR STANDARDS.</p>
    <p>1. These then are the witnesses to which Protestants appeal for testimony 
    relative to those doctrines and obligations of the Church of Rome which they 
    reject. Romanists cannot affirm that these are Protestant or heretical 
    witnesses. They cannot deny that they are their own standard authorities. 
    For what can the Church of Rome's own representation of herself be, if it be 
    not found in her creed of Pius IV., her oath of allegiance exacted from her 
    bishops, her authentic catechism, her general councils, the bulls of her 
    popes, her liturgical books, their own traditions, and Scripture as 
    explained by them, and books of devotion? We cannot allow that every private 
    priest or member of the Church of Rome should give his own opinions merely 
    as the standard of doctrine. We will have recourse to the oracular response 
    of the church, and insist that they be represented by themselves—not, 
    however, by private individuals, but by their legal representatives. But, 
    then, there is nothing which they dread so much as the testimony of their 
    own church. It is like the conscience of the wicked, which is their worst 
    enemy.</p>
    <p>2. It is a principal aim of all their controvertists to employ every mode 
    of evasion in order to disconcert their opposers. There is even a marked 
    difference between the tone of these Romish divines who speak dogmatically 
    for the instruction of their own members, and that of those who attempt to 
    answer the objections of their antagonists. With the former, all is matter 
    of downright certainty; with the latter, all is doubt, difficulty, 
    subterfuge, and evasion. When the faithful are to be instructed, every 
    priest becomes the sure depositary of the infallible decisions of an 
    infallible church; but when Protestants are to be confuted, the declarations 
    of their most illustrious men are of no authority. Councils are discovered 
    to have been but partly approved; popes did not speak ex cathedra; 
    cardinals and bishops are but private doctors; and who cares for the opinion 
    of an obscure priest or friar? Thus nothing is so difficult as to know what 
    the belief of Roman Catholics really is; and when a Protestant adduces their 
    own writers as witnesses, he is frequently told that he is a misrepresenter 
    of their church. <i><font face="Times New Roman">— </font></i>Ibid, pgs.

  <p>What follows are the sentiments expressed by a former Roman Catholic over 
  100 years ago, on the topic of the &quot;unanimous consent of the Fathers&quot;.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2 align="center">Chapter 16</h2>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#000000" size="4">The Priests of Rome and 
  the Holy Fathers; or, <br>
  how I Swore to give up the Word of God to follow the Word of Men</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are several imposing ceremonies at the ordination of a priest; and 
    I will never forget the joy I felt when the Roman Pontiff, presenting to me 
    the Bible, ordered me, with a solemn voice, to study and preach it. That 
    order passed through my soul as a beam of light. But, alas! those rays of 
    light and life were soon to be followed, as a flash of lightning in a stormy 
    night, by the most sudden and distressing darkness!<br>
    <br>
    When holding the sacred volume, I accepted with unspeakable joy the command 
    of studying and preaching its saving truth; but I felt as if a thunderbolt 
    had fallen upon me when I pronounced the awful oath which is required from 
    every priest: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;I will never interpret the Holy Scriptures except according to the 
      unanimous consent of the Holy Fathers.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Many times, with the other students in theology, I had discussed the 
    nature of that strange oath; still more often, in the silence of my 
    meditations, alone in the presence of God, I had tried to fathom the 
    bottomless abyss which, it seemed to me, was dug under my feet by it, and 
    every time my conscience had shrunk in terror from its consequences. But I 
    was not the only one in the seminary who contemplated, with an anxious mind, 
    its evidently blasphemous nature.<br>
    <br>
    About six months before our ordination, Stephen Baillargeon, one of my 
    fellow theological students, had said in my presence to our superior, the 
    Rev. Mr. Raimbault: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Allow me to tell you that one of the things with which I cannot 
      reconcile my conscience is the solemn oath we will have to take, `That we 
      will never interpret the Scriptures except according to the unanimous 
      consent of the Holy Fathers! We have not given a single hour yet to the 
      serious study of the Holy Fathers. I know many priests, and not a single 
      one of them has ever studied the Holy Fathers; they have not even got them 
      in their libraries! We will probably walk in their footsteps. It may be 
      that not a single volume of the Holy Fathers will ever fall into our 
      hands! In the name of common sense, how can we swear that we will follow 
      the sentiments of men of whom we know absolutely nothing, and about whom, 
      it is more probable, we will never know anything, except by mere vague 
      hearsay?&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our superior gave evident signs of weakness in his answer to that 
    unexpected difficulty. But his embarrassment grew much greater when I said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&quot;Baillargeon cannot contemplate that oath without anxiety, and he has 
      given you some of his reasons; but he has not said the last word on that 
      strange oath. If you will allow me, Mr. Superior, I will present you some 
      more formidable objections. It is not so much on account of our ignorance 
      of the doctrines of the Holy Fathers that I tremble when I think I will 
      have `to swear never to interpret the Scriptures, except according to 
      their unanimous consent.'&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Would to God that I could say, with Baillargeon, `I know nothing of 
      the Holy Fathers: how can I swear they will guide me in all my ways?' It 
      is true that we know so little of them that it is supremely ridiculous, if 
      it is not an insult to God and man, that we take them for our guides. But 
      my regret is that we know already too much of the Holy Fathers to be 
      exempt from perjuring ourselves, when we swear that we will not interpret 
      the Holy Scriptures except according to their unanimous consent.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Is it not a fact that the Holy Fathers' writings are so perfectly kept 
      out of sight, that it is absolutely impossible to read and study them? But 
      even if we had access to them, have we sufficient time at our disposal to 
      study them so perfectly that we could conscientiously swear that we will 
      follow them? How can we follow a thing we do not see, which we cannot 
      hear, and about which we do not know more than the man in the moon? Our 
      shameful ignorance of the Holy Fathers is a sufficient reason to make us 
      fear at the approach of the solemn hour that we will swear to follow them. 
      Yes! But we know enough of the Holy Fathers to chill the blood in our 
      veins when swearing to interpret the Holy Scriptures only according to 
      their unanimous consent. Please, Mr. Superior, tell us what are the texts 
      of Scripture on which the Holy Fathers are unanimous. You respect yourself 
      too much to try to answer a question which no honest man has, or will ever 
      dare to answer. And if you, one of the most learned men of France, cannot 
      put your finger on the texts of the Holy Bible and say, `The Holy Fathers 
      are perfectly unanimous on these texts!' How can we, poor young 
      ecclesiastics of the humble College of Nicolet, say, `The Holy Fathers are 
      unanimously of the same mind on those texts?' But if we cannot distinguish 
      today, and if we shall never be able to distinguish between the texts on 
      which the Holy Fathers are unanimous and the ones on which they differ, 
      how can we dare to swear before God and men to interpret every text of the 
      Scriptures only according to the unanimous consent of those Holy Fathers?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;By that awful oath, will we not be absolutely bound to remain mute as 
      dead men on every text on which the Holy Fathers have differed, under the 
      evident penalty of becoming perjured? Will not every text on which the 
      Holy Fathers have differed become as the dead carcass which the Israelites 
      could not touch, except by defiling themselves? After that strange oath, 
      to interpret the Scripture only according to the unanimous consent of the 
      Holy Fathers, will we not be absolutely deprived of the privilege of 
      studying or preaching on a text on which they have differed?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;The consequences of that oath are legion, and every one of them seems to 
      me the death of our ministry, the damnation of our souls! You have read 
      the history of the Church, as we have it here, written by Henrion, 
      Berrault, Bell, Costel, and Fleury. Well, what is the prominent fact in 
      those reliable histories of the Church? Is it not that the Church has 
      constantly been filled with the noise of the controversies of Holy Fathers 
      with Holy Fathers? Do we not find, on every page, that the Holy Fathers of 
      one century very often differed from the Holy Fathers of another century 
      in very important matters? Is it not a public and undeniable fact, that 
      the history of our Holy Church is almost nothing else than the history of 
      the hard conflict, stern divisions, unflinching contradictions and 
      oppositions of Holy Fathers to Holy Fathers?&quot;<br>

      &quot;Here is a big volume of manuscript written by me, containing only 
      extracts from our best Church historians, filled with the public disputes 
      of Holy Fathers among themselves on almost every subject of Christianity.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There are Holy Fathers who say, with our best modern theologians St. 
      Thomas, Bellarmine and Liguori that we must kill heretics as we kill wild 
      beasts; while many others say that we must tolerate them! You all know the 
      name of the Holy Father who sends to hell all the widows who marry a 
      second time, while other Holy Fathers are of a different mind. Some of 
      them, you know well, had very different notions from ours about purgatory. 
      Is it necessary for me to give you the names of the Holy Fathers, in 
      Africa and Asia, who refused to accept the supreme jurisdiction we 
      acknowledge in the Pope over all churches? Several Holy Fathers have 
      denied the supreme authority of the Church of Rome you know it; they have 
      laughed at the excommunications of the Popes! Some even have gladly died, 
      when excommunicated by the Pope, without doing anything to reconcile 
      themselves to him! What do we find in the six volumes of letters we have 
      still from St. Jerome, if not the undeniable fact that he filled the 
      Church with the noise of his harsh denunciations of the scriptural views 
      of St. Augustine on many important points. You have read these letters? 
      Well, have you not concluded that St. Jerome and St. Augustine agreed 
      almost only on one thing, which was, to disagree on every subject they 
      treated?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Did not St. Jerome knock his head against nearly all the Holy Fathers of 
      his time? And has he not received hard knocks from almost all the Holy 
      Fathers with whom he was acquainted? Is it not a public fact that St. 
      Jerome and several other Holy Fathers rejected the sacred books of the 
      Maccabees, Judith, Tobias, just as the heretics of our time reject them?<br>
      <br>
      &quot;And now we are gravely asked, in the name of the God of Truth, to swear 
      that we will interpret the Holy Scriptures only according to the unanimous 
      consent of those Holy Fathers, who have been unanimous but in one thing, 
      which was never to agree with each other, and sometimes not even with 
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;For it is a well-known fact, though it is a very deplorable one, for 
      instance, that St. Augustine did not always keep to the same correct views 
      on the text &quot;Thou art Peter, and upon that rock I will build My church.' 
      After holding correct views on that fundamental truth he gave it up, at 
      the end of his life, to say, with the Protestants of our day, that `upon 
      that rock means only Christ, and not Peter.' Now, how can I be bound by an 
      oath to follow the views of men who have themselves been wavering and 
      changing, when the Word of God must stand as an unmoving rock to my heart? 
      If you require from us an oath, why put into our hands the history of the 
      Church, which has stuffed our memory with the undeniable facts of the 
      endless fierce divisions of the Holy Fathers on almost every question 
      which the Scriptures present to our faith?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Would to God that I could say, with Baillargeon, I know nothing of the 
      Holy Fathers! Then I could perhaps be at peace with my conscience, after 
      perjuring myself by promising a thing that I cannot do.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I was lately told by the Rev. Leprohon, that it is absolutely necessary 
      to go to the Holy Fathers in order to understand the Holy Scriptures! But 
      I will respectfully repeat today what I then said on that subject.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;If I am too ignorant or too stupid to understand St. Mark, St. Luke and 
      St. Paul, how can I be intelligent enough to understand Jerome, Augustine 
      and Tertullian? And if St. Matthew, St. John and St. Peter have not got 
      from God the grace of writing with a sufficient degree of light and 
      clearness to be understood by men of good-will, how is it that Justin, 
      Clemens and Cyprian have received from our God a favour of lucidity and 
      clearness which He denied to His apostles and evangelists? If I cannot 
      rely upon my private judgment when studying, with the help of God, the 
      Holy Scriptures, how can I rely on my private judgment when studying the 
      Holy Fathers? You constantly tell me I cannot rely on my private judgment 
      to understand and interpret the Holy Scriptures; but will you please tell 
      me with what judgment and intelligence I shall have to interpret and 
      understand the writings of the Holy Fathers, if it be not with my own 
      private judgment? Must I borrow the judgment and intelligence of some of 
      my neighbours in order to understand and interpret, for instance, the 
      writings of Origen? or shall I be allowed to go and hear what that Holy 
      Father wants from me, with my own private intelligence? But again, if you 
      are forced to confess that I have nothing else but my private judgment and 
      intelligence to read, understand and follow the Holy Fathers, and that I 
      not only can but must rely on my own private judgment, without any fear, 
      in that case, how is it that I will be lost if I make use of that same 
      private and personal judgment when at the feet of Jesus, listening to His 
      eternal and life-giving words?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Nothing distresses me so much in our holy religion as that want of 
      confidence in God when we go to the feet of Jesus to hear or read His 
      soul-saving words, and the abundance of self-confidence, when we go among 
      sinful and fallible men, to know what they say.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;It is not to the Holy Scriptures that we are invited to go to know what 
      the Lord saith: it is to the Holy Fathers!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Would it be possible that, in our Holy Church, the Word of God would be 
      darkness, and the words of men light!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;This dogma, or article of our religion, by which we must go to the Holy 
      Fathers in order to know what `The Lord saith,' and not to the Holy 
      Scriptures, is to my soul what a handful of sand would be to my eyes<font 
      face="Times New Roman"> — </font>it makes me perfectly blind.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;When our venerable bishop places the Holy Scriptures in my hands and 
      commands me to study and preach them, I shall understand what he means, and 
      he will know what he says. He will give me a most sublime work to perform; 
      and, by the grace of God, I hope to do it. But when he orders me to swear 
      that I will never interpret the Holy Scriptures except according to the 
      unanimous consent of the Holy Fathers, will he not make a perjured man of 
      me, and will he not say a thing to which he has not given sufficient 
      attention? For to swear that we will never interpret anything of the 
      Scriptures, except according to the unanimous consent of the Holy Fathers, 
      is to swear to a thing as impossible and ridiculous as to take the moon 
      with our hands. I say more, it is to swear that we will never study nor 
      interpret a single chapter of the Bible. For it is probable that there are 
      very few chapters of that Holy Book which have not been a cause of serious 
      differences between some of the Holy Fathers.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;As the writings of the Holy Fathers fill at least two hundred volumes in 
      folio, it will not take us less than ten years of constant study to know 
      on what question they are or are not unanimous! If, after that time of 
      study, I find that they are unanimous on the question of orthodoxy which I 
      must believe and preach, all will be right with me. I will walk with a 
      fearless heart to the gates of eternity, with the certainty of following 
      the true way of salvation. But if among fifty Holy Fathers there are 
      forty-nine on one side and one only on the opposite side, in what awful 
      state of distress will I be plunged! Shall I not be then as a ship in a 
      stormy night, after she has lost her compass, her masts, and her helm. If 
      I were allowed to follow the majority, there would always be a plank of 
      safety to rescue me from the impending wreck. But the Pope has inexorably 
      tied us to the unanimity. If my faith is not the faith of unanimity, I am 
      for ever damned. I am out of the Church!<br>
      <br>
      &quot;What a frightful alternative is just before us! We must either perjure 
      ourselves, by swearing to follow a unanimity which is a fable, in order to 
      remain Roman Catholics, or we must plunge into the abyss of impiety and 
      atheism by refusing to swear that we will adhere to a unanimity which 
      never existed.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It was visible, at the end of that long and stormy conference, that the 
    fears and anxieties of Baillargeon and mine were partaken of by every one of 
    the students in theology. The boldness of our expressions brought upon us a 
    real storm. But our Superior did not dare to face or answer a single one of 
    our arguments; he was evidently embarrassed, and nothing could surpass his 
    joy when the bell told him that the hour of the conference was over. He 
    promised to answer us the next day; but the next day he did nothing but 
    throw dust into our eyes, and abuse us to his heart's content. He began by 
    forbidding me to read any more of the controversial books I had brought a 
    few months before, among which was the celebrated Derry discussion between 
    seven priests and seven Protestants. I had to give back the well known 
    discussion between &quot;Pope and Maguire,&quot; and between Gregg and the same 
    Maguire. I had also to give up the numbers of the Avenir and other books of 
    Lamenais, which I had got the liberty, as a privilege, to read. It was 
    decided that my intelligence was not clear enough, and that my faith was not 
    sufficiently strong to read those books. I had nothing to do but to bow my 
    head under the yoke and obey, without a word or murmur. The darkest night 
    was made around our understandings, and we had to believe that that awful 
    darkness was the shining light of God! We rejected the bright truth which 
    had so nearly conquered our mind in order to accept the most ridiculous 
    sophisms as gospel truths! We did the most degrading action a man can do we 
    silenced the voice of our conscience, and we consented to follow our 
    superior's views, as a brute follows the order of his master; we consented 
    to be in the hands of our superiors like a stick in the hands of the 
    traveler.<br>
    <br>
    During the months which elapsed between that hard fought, through lost 
    battle, and the solemn hour of my priestly ordination, I did all I could to 
    subdue and annihilate my thoughts on that subject. My hope was that I had 
    entirely succeeded. But, to my dismay, that reason suddenly awoke, as from a 
    long sleep, when I had perjured myself, as every priest has to do. A chill 
    of horror and shame ran through all my frame in spite of myself. In my 
    inmost soul a cry was heard from my wounded conscience, &quot;You annihilate the 
    Word of God! You rebel against the Holy Ghost! You deny the Holy Scriptures 
    to follow the steps of sinful men! You reject the pure waters of eternal 
    life, to drink the waters of death.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    In order to choke again the voice of my conscience, I did what my Church 
    advised me to do I cried to my wafer god and to the blessed Virgin Mary that 
    they might come to my help, and silence the voices which were troubling my 
    peace by shaking my faith.<br>
    <br>
    With the utmost sincerity, the day of my ordination, I renewed the promise 
    that I had already so often made, and said in the presence of God and His 
    angels, &quot;I promise that I will never believe anything except according to 
    the teachings of my Holy and Apostolic Church of Rome.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And on that pillow of folly, ignorance, and fanaticism I laid my head to 
    sleep the sleep of spiritual death, with the two hundred millions of slaves 
    whom the Pope sees at his feet.<br>
    <br>
    And I slept that sleep till the God of our salvation, in His great mercy, 
    awoke me, by giving to my soul the light, the truth, and the life which are 
    in Jesus Christ.</p>
