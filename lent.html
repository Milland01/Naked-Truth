<blockquote>
  <p>Search the scriptures diligently, from Old Testament to New, and you will
  find no mention of Jews or Christians observing an annual period of 40 days of
  fasting and abstinence preceding the festival of the Passover, yet today most
  of the Christian world observes a 40 day period called Lent, which precedes
  the festival of Easter Sunday. A period of 40 days is rather common in
  scripture, however:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It rained 40 days and nights: Gen 7:4, 12.</p>
    <p>Forty days after sighting the tops of the mountains, Noah set forth a
    raven and a dove: Gen 8:6-7.</p>
    <p>Joseph mourned the death of his father Jacob for a period of 40 days: Gen
    49:33 - Gen 50:3.</p>
    <p>Moses on Sinai for 40 days: Exo 24:18, 34:28, Deu 9:9-11.</p>
    <p>Moses pleads for Israel 40 days on Sinai: Deu 9:18-25, 10:10.</p>
    <p>Canaan spied on for 40 days: Num 13:25, 14:34.</p>
    <p>Goliath taunted Israel for 40 days: 1 Sam 17:16.</p>
    <p>Elijah fasted and journeyed to Horeb for 40 days: 1 Kings 19:8.</p>
    <p>Ezekiel bore the iniquity of Judah for 40 days: Eze 4:6.</p>
    <p>Jonah warned Nineveh of judgment in 40 days: Jonah 3:4.</p>
    <p>Jesus fasted in the wilderness for 40 days: Matt 4:2, Mark 1:13, Luke
    4:2.</p>
    <p>Jesus was seen for 40 days after His crucifixion: Acts 1:3.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, if the Bible does not enjoin the Jew or the Christian to observe the 40
  day period called Lent, then what is its origin? Can the answer be found in
  the Catholic Church?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>
    <p>540</strong> ... &quot;For we have not a high priest who is unable to
    sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tested
    as we are, yet without sinning&quot; [Heb 4:15]. By the solemn forty days of
    Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of Jesus in the
    desert.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Lent is the 40-day period (Sundays excluded) prior to Easter, which the
    church observes as a penitential season. It begins on Ash Wednesday (which
    can occur any time between February 4 and March 11, depending upon the date
    of Easter), and it concludes with the Passiontide, the two-week period
    during which the church's liturgy follows Christ's activity closely through
    the final stages of his life on earth. These two weeks are called Passion
    Week and Holy Week. It was once claimed that the Lenten practice was of
    apostolic origin, but historians fix its establishment at a later date,
    probably the 5th century. Catholics are required to fast and are urged to
    adopt other penitential modes during the season.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Lent is the period of six and one half weeks from Ash Wednesday to Easter
    Sunday. During Lent, for 40 days, excluding Sundays, fasting is recommended
    for all Catholics according to the laws of fast. This is reminiscent of the
    40 days of our Lord's unbroken fast (Mt. 4:3-4). The entire period of Lent
    is also a time of spiritual preparation for the passion, death, and
    resurrection of Christ. It is observed as a time of penitence other than
    fasting, and as a time of prayer. The Liturgy of the Church reflects the
    significance of this period of spiritual preparation: each day has a special
    Mass assigned to it; those Masses date back to the seventh and eighth
    centuries; there are no feasts observed on Sundays; purple vestments are the
    daily color...</p>
    <p>It [Ash Wednesday] was established as the first day of Lent by [Pope] St.
    Gregory the Great (590 to 604).</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The reasons for celebrating our major feasts when we do are many and
    varied. In general, however, it is true that many of them have at least an
    indirect connection with the pre-Christian [pagan] feasts celebrated about
    the same time of year — feasts centering around the harvest, the rebirth
    of the sun at the winter solstice (now Dec. 21, but Dec. 25 in the old
    Julian calendar), the renewal of nature in spring, and so on.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em>
    <p>The observance of Lent dates back to the Apostles.</em></p>
    <p>MYTH ... In the fifth century, some Fathers claimed that Lent was of
    apostolic institution, but the claim is doubtful. From the earliest
    Christian times everyone agreed that a penitential season should precede the
    solemnities of Easter, but for at least three centuries there was no
    agreement over how long that should be. Saint Irenaeus, writing around the
    year 190, clued to the diversity of opinion, saying: &quot;some think they
    ought to fast for one day, others for two days, and others even for several,
    while other reckon forty hours both of day and night to their fast.&quot;
    Apparently he knew nothing about any Lent or pre-Easter fast of forty days,
    else he would have mentioned it.</p>
    <p>In the fourth century Saint Athanasius enjoined the people of Alexandria
    to observe a forty day period of fasting prior to Easter, indicating that
    this was the mode now practiced throughout Christendom.&quot; ... [W]hile
    all the world is fasting, we who are in Egypt should not become a laughing
    stock as the only people who do not fast but take pleasure in those
    days.&quot; Athanasius wrote. The year was 339, and Athanasius was recently
    back from a trip to Europe, including Rome.</p>
    <p>Some sources allege that the forty-day Lent was not known in the West
    until the time of Saint Ambrose (c339-397). The date of Athanasius' letter
    would seem to negate that theory.</p>
    <p>So, no, our Lent does not date from the time of the Apostles. But
    apparently it was observed before the year 339. That's early enough.</p>

  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>So according to Catholics, Lent is derived from the 40 days Jesus spent
  fasting in the wilderness, but it is admitted that the observance of Lent was
  unknown to the disciples and it did not find its way into the church until
  several centuries after the time of Christ. It should be noted that the 40
  days of fasting in the wilderness preceded the earthly ministry of Jesus,
  which lasted some three and a half years, and was not connected in any way to
  His crucifixion or the Passover.</p>
  <p>Note that Lent is a moveable observance, connected to and preceding the
  festival of Easter. Easter is celebrated on a day specified only by the Roman
  Catholic Church, and not the Bible, and is fixed based <em>on the sun</em> and
  the Spring or Vernal equinox.</p>
