<center><b><font size="5">THE BIBLICAL TRUTH ABOUT HELL</font></b></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Is the concept of eternal torment in Hell really Biblical? Most Christians
  think there is a place of eternal fire and torment called Hell which will be
  the ultimate fate of the wicked. Satan, they believe, is to rule in this
  limited kingdom of Hell and torture his unwilling subjects for all eternity.
  The concept of an eternal fiery Hell designed to torment sinners forever has
  been taught by the Catholic Church and accepted as true for many centuries.
  Integral to this concept is the proposition that no one will ever really die,
  since upon the death of your external mortal body, your spirit immediately
  (supposedly) travels to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory. You either live forever in
  heaven with God, or you live forever in torment in Hell with Satan and his
  angels - at least that is what is taught and believed by most of the Christian
  world.</p>
  <p>I would like to explore what the Bible really teaches and how it compares
  to this Catholic concept of Hell and death. Lets start in the book of Romans-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note the wages for sin is <i>death</i>, not eternal punishing and torment
  in some place called Hell. If Christ did <i>not</i> die in our place, if He
  did <i>not</i> take our sins to the cross and pay the death penalty that we
  are condemned to as sinners, then the price for sin is <i>not paid</i> and we <i>retain</i>
  our sins, and we will surely pay the death penalty ourselves because of our
  sins.&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also
    the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</p>
    <p>Ezek 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Scripture makes very clear that unrepentant unbelieving sinners will surely
  pay the penalty of death for their sins if they do not believe in Jesus
  Christ:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 5:24 <font color="#FF0000">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
    believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come
    into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</font></p>
    <p>John 10:27 <font color="#FF0000">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</font><br>
    John 10:28 <font color="#FF0000">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
    neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that there are only two fates listed. Sinners will perish, but the
  faithful will receive eternal life. It should be plain that these verses say
  nothing about sinners living forever in eternal torment. If sinners perish (die) and do not have
  eternal life, then what exactly is death and what happens when you die?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eccl 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
    any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is
    forgotten.<br>
    Eccl 9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
    neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done
    under the sun.</p>
    <p>Psa 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
    silence.</p>
    <p>Psa 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very
    day his thoughts perish.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Death here is described as the very thoughts of a person perishing, that
  the dead know nothing, and do not even praise the Lord. The dead return to the
  earth, the grave, there is no conscious spirit that survives to ascend to
  heaven. Death is obliteration. Next let's look at what has to be the most
  quoted verse from the Bible-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:16 <font color="#FF0000">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
    that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
    life.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What Christian does not know this verse? Maybe they can quote it by heart,
  but do they really understand what it says? Again there are only two choices
  presented. Believers will receive eternal life, but the unbeliever will
  perish. Eternal life or eternal death. The wicked will not receive eternal
  life or eternal punishment, they will die, which means to perish! When you
  die, you are gone, you no longer exist, not even in some spirit form.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and <b><em>he
    that believeth not the Son shall not see life; </em></b>but the wrath of God
    abideth on him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In context, the unbeliever will <em>not</em> receive eternal life, but
  rather eternal death, and death <em>is</em> obliteration. But you may ask, 
  what about this verse:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
    the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Doesn't this prove that when the faithful die, they immediately ascend to
  heaven in spirit? No it does not. Let me explain why. If the dead rest in the
  grave awaiting their resurrection, death then is like a sound sleep. Note the
  following-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Deu 31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
    fathers; ...</p>
    <p>1 Ki 2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
    David.</p>
    <p>Acts 13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will
    of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers,</p>
    <p>Acts 2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: ...</p>
    <p>(Note that David, though sleeping with his fathers (dead), is not
    ascended into heaven. He is still in his grave.)</p>
    <p>1 Ki 11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
    of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
    <p>2 Sam 7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
    fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
    bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
    <p>John 11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, 
    <font color="#FF0000">Our
    friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</font><br>
    John 11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.<br>
    John 11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
    spoken of taking of rest in sleep.<br>
    John 11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <font color="#FF0000">Lazarus is dead.</font></p>
    <p>1 Cor 15:51 Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
    shall all be changed,<br>
    1 Cor 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for
    the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
    shall be changed.<br>
    1 Cor 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
    must put on immortality.<br>
    1 Cor 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
    this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the
    saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>
    1 Cor 15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
    <p>(Note that immortality is not received or &quot;put on&quot; until the
    second coming. We do not have it until then.)</p>
    <p>1 Th 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
    also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.<br>
    1 Th 4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
    are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent (precede)
    them which are asleep.<br>
    1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
    the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in
    Christ shall rise first:<br>
    1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together
    with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever
    be with the Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In many places the Bible confirms that death is like a sound sleep, though
  I have listed just a few. Note that sleep cannot be limited to the mortal
  body, it is what happens to the conscious mind. When you fall asleep and sleep
  soundly, you have no knowledge of how long you have slept. You lose track of
  time and reality. When you awake it is as if only a moment has passed, yet it
  may have been many hours. Death is exactly the same. Upon your death your
  thought processes cease, and you sleep in the grave until your resurrection.
  So 2 Cor 5:8 cannot be used to prove instant ascension to heaven, not in view
  of the many many verses that clearly call death a sleep.</p>
  <p>But doesn't the Bible teach that Jesus, after his death, descended into
  Hell to preach there and free the captives?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eph 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
    captive, and gave gifts unto men.<br>
    Eph 4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
    into the lower parts of the earth?<br>
    Eph 4:10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all
    heavens, that he might fill all things.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Verse 9 is basically asking- What significance there is to the resurrection
  of Jesus if He did not first die and rest in the grave? The resurrection
  represents victory over death, the penalty for sin. For Jesus to have victory
  over the grave, He must first die. Jesus was dead, in the grave, and remained
  there until His resurrection early on Sunday. He went nowhere, and did nothing
  for that period of time.</p>
  <p><b><u>The Thief on the Cross</u></b></p>
  <p>Wait, you say, Jesus told the thief on the cross that He would be with him
  that day in paradise!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
    thou be with me in paradise.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The punctuation has been supplied in the translation and is not present in
  the original texts, let me just move one comma-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Verily I say unto thee To day, shalt
    thou be with me in paradise.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In English that sounds stilted and awkward. It would be properly
  interpreted as-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him,<br>
    <font color="#FF0000">Verily I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with me in paradise.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is a promise that the thief will see paradise, but it was not a promise
  to be fulfilled that day. But that is unfair, you say. It is not what the
  Bible means. You are twisting it to make it fit your own premise. Look at the
  following verse from John-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 20:17 Jesus saith unto her, <font color="#FF0000">Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
    to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
    Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here Jesus is very clearly telling Mary Magdalene that he has not yet
  ascended to heaven, and this was said on Sunday! So He could not possibly have
  ascended to heaven with the thief on Friday afternoon. Jesus had spent the
  entire Sabbath at rest, asleep in death in the tomb, to be resurrected on
  Sunday morning by His Father in a triumphal victory over death.</p>
    <p align="left"><u><font size="4"><a name="Paradise">Paradise</a> Proved to be Heaven from Scripture</font></u></p>
  <p>Paradise is mentioned 3 times in scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 23:43&nbsp; And Jesus said unto him, <font color="#ff0000">Verily I say 
    unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</font></p>
    <p>2 Cor 12:4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable 
    words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 2:7&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the 
    Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of 
    the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above verse says the tree of life is in the middle of paradise. Right?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 21:10&nbsp; And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high 
    mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, ...<br>
    ...<br>
    Rev 22:2&nbsp; In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, 
    was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded 
    her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of 
    the nations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That says the tree of life is in the New Jerusalem. Right?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 14:2&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I 
    would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</font><br>
    John 14:3&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and 
    receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That refers to the New Jerusalem, which is the Father's house, which is in 
  heaven. Right?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 21:2&nbsp; And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from 
    God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
    <p>Rev 21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high 
    mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out 
    of heaven from God,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That says the New Jerusalem comes to earth from heaven. Right?<br>
  Conclusion: the Bible teaches that paradise and heaven are the exact same 
  place!</p>
  <p><b><u>After the Second Death - No more Death</u></b></p>
  <p>Now let's move to the book of Revelation and the ultimate fate of death-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
    second death.<br>
    Rev 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
    into the lake of fire.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that death and hell (the grave) are cast into the lake of fire and
  destroyed. They will no longer be. Death and the grave will be ended, never
  again to plague mankind. If all believers receive the gift of eternal life,
  and they lead a life without sin, then there can be no death or grave. They
  both cease. This second death of the lake of fire is what faith in Jesus will
  keep you from-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 2:11 <font color="#FF0000">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
    churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
    on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and
    of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
    <p>Rev 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and 
    murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, 
    shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: 
    which is the second death.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The second death is permanent destruction. For the wicked it will mean
  eternal obliteration. It is the total destruction of the second death that
  Jesus gained victory over for us, if we have faith. Just as Matthew 16:18
  states, the gates of hell (the grave/death) shall not prevail against the
  faithful church, not even the second death.</p>
  <p><b><u>Satan's Final Fate</u></b></p>
  <p>So what is Satan's fate if there will not be anywhere for him to rule over
  sinners?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
    and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
    tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Satan will also be cast into the lake of fire (the second death), where he
  will perish, along with the beast, false prophet, death and the grave. Oh, but
  I hear you say, this verse says there will be torment forever. The Greek word
  translated as forever is aion (G165), which does not always mean forever as we
  understand it. From this Greek word aion we derive the word eon. An eon is an
  unspecified, indefinite period of time, but it does have an end. Geologists
  use the word to describe very long periods of geologic time or ages, but one
  eon does end and another begin.</p>
  <p>From Strong's (emphasis is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>165. aion, ahee-ohn'; from the same as G104; prop. <b>an age</b>; by
    extens. perpetuity (also past); by impl. the world; spec. (Jewish) a
    Messianic period (present or future):--<b>age</b>, course, eternal, (for)
    ever (-more), [n-]ever, (beginning of the, while the) world (began, without
    end). Comp. G5550.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here is another case for aion meaning an age, but not in perpetuity-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The term Aeon appears in the New Testament where Paul refers to &quot;the
    rulers of this age (aion)&quot; [1 Cor 2:6] and in the Johannine phrase
    &quot;life everlasting (zoe aionios). [John 3:16, 36; 4:14; 5:24; 6:27;
    6:40; 12:50] ...</p>
    <p>Yet, Aeon had another meaning in the ancient world which is frequently
    overlooked. It referred to the vast ages, the twelve Aeons or Platonic
    Months with make up the Great Year. Because of the precession of the
    equinoxes, the sun moves backward through the zodiac, one degree every
    seventy-two years. Every 2,160 years the spring point or vernal equinox
    slips into a new zodiacal sign. We are now entering the Age or Aeon of
    Aquarius (<em>circa</em> 2000-3000 A.D.), two thousand years ago, the Age of
    Pisces (<em>circa</em> 1-2000 A.D.) was getting underway.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>So Rev 20:10 can be saying that the torment will be for an eon, an
  unspecified but finite period of time, but that it will end. The lake of fire
  is where the concept of an eternal burning hell comes from. Yet the lake of
  fire is described as the second death as we saw in Rev 20:14. It is a death
  from which no one will ever be resurrected. It is obliteration for eternity.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Deu 15:17 Then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through his ear unto 
  the door, and <u>he shall be thy servant for ever</u>. And also unto thy 
  maidservant thou shalt do likewise.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above verse also speaks of forever in a finite sense. The word is 
  Strong's 5769. 'owlam:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>5769. 'owlam, o-lawm'; or 'olam, o-lawm'; from H5956; prop. concealed, i.e. 
  the vanishing point; gen. time out of mind (past or fut.), i.e. (practically) 
  eternity; freq. adv. (espec. with prep. pref.) always:--always (-s), ancient 
  (time), any more, continuance, eternal, (for, [n-]) ever (-lasting, -more, of 
  old), lasting, long (time), (of) old (time), perpetual, at any time, 
  (beginning of the) world (+ without end). Comp. H5331, H5703.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, however, the servant ceased to be a servant upon his death. 
  Forever, in this case lasted until the servant's death. In fact, the NIV reads 
  this way:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Deu 15:17 then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door, 
  and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Using the same manner of thinking, this is how Rev. 20:10 would be 
  understood:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
    and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
    tormented day and night for <u>as long as they shall live</u>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Need more definite proof? Let's look at Ezekiel, where the fate of Satan is
  more clearly described-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 28:12 Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and
    say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of
    wisdom, and perfect in beauty.<br>
    Ezek 28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone
    was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx,
    and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the
    workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day
    that thou wast created.<br>
    Ezek 28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
    so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in
    the midst of the stones of fire.<br>
    Ezek 28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast
    created, till iniquity was found in thee.<br>
    Ezek 28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of
    thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as
    profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering
    cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.<br>
    Ezek 28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast
    corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the
    ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.<br>
    Ezek 28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine
    iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a
    fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to
    ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="ark2.gif" width="309" height="138"></p>
  <p align="left">It is well recognized that this passage, though addressed to
  the King of Tyre, is actually speaking of Satan, who originally was a covering
  cherub (angel) in heaven. The covering cherubs are represented on either end
  of the ark of the testimony, in the sanctuary (Exo 25:19-21) above the mercy
  seat which covers the Ten Commandments. Satan will first be displayed before
  all so that they may see the father of sin. He will then be consumed by fire
  and destroyed, brought to ashes on the earth as he is cast into the lake of
  fire as Rev 20:10 describes. He will no longer exist!</p>
  <p>Satan's demise is also prophesied by a head wound in Genesis:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee (Satan) and the woman, and
    between thy seed and her seed; it (Jesus) shall bruise thy head, and thou
    shalt bruise his heel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The following passage from the King James also makes Satan's ultimate fate
  clear:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 2:14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
    he [Jesus] also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death
    he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;<br>
    Heb 2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
    subject to bondage.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The word translated as &quot;destroy&quot; above in the Greek is <em>katargeo</em>,
  which is defined in Strong's as follows (emphasis is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>G2673. katargeo, kat-arg-eh'-o; from G2596 and G691; to be (render)
    entirely idle (useless), lit. or fig.:--<b>abolish</b>, <b>cease</b>,

  <b><u>
  <p>Eternal Everlasting Fire - Does It Burn Forever?</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 18:8 <font color="#FF0000">Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and
    cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or
    maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting
    fire.</font><br>
    Mat 18:9 <font color="#FF0000">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee:
    it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having
    two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 25:41 <font color="#FF0000">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
    me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</font></p>
    <p>Jude 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
    manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange
    flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal
    fire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note carefully the last verse. Sodom and Gomorrha surely did burn, but are
  they burning now? Of course not. So just what is meant by an eternal or
  everlasting fire? Let me use a match as an illustration. If you light a match
  and let it burn to ashes, the match cannot be reconstituted into a match, it
  has been eternally burned and destroyed. The match burned until there was
  nothing left to burn, then the fire went out. This is what happened in Sodom
  and Gomorrha. They burned until there was nothing left to burn, and <em>then
  the fire went out.</em> The results of the fire are complete destruction, but
  the fire itself does not burn eternally.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Pet 2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes
    condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that
    after should live ungodly;</p>
    <p>2 Pet 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
    the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
    shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein
    shall be burned up.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here in 2nd Peter, Sodom and Gomorrha are explicitly held up as examples of
  the fate of the wicked, which will similarly be reduced to ashes in the lake
  of fire (hell fire) of Revelation 19 and 20. It will burn and destroy Satan
  and his angels as well as all sinners, but then it will go out. The <em>results</em>
  of that fire are everlasting, but the fire will indeed go out, just exactly as
  it did with Sodom and Gomorrha. Then there will be a new heaven and a new
  earth:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
    the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.<br>
    Rev 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God
    out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br>
    Rev 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
    tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall
    be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<br>
    Rev 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall
    be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
    more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The &quot;former things&quot; are sin, death, Satan and all the rest of the
  wicked. They will pass away in the lake of fire, be reduced to ashes and be no
  more.</p>
  <p><b><u>The Unquenchable Fire - Does It Burn Forever?</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 66:24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
    that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither
    shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</p>
    <p>Mat 3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
    cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he
    shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:<br>
    Mat 3:12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor,
    and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with
    unquenchable fire.</p>
    <p>Mark 9:43 <font color="#FF0000">And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee
    to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the
    fire that never shall be quenched:</font><br>
    Mark 9:44 <font color="#FF0000">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</font><br>
    Mark 9:45 <font color="#FF0000">And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
    enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the
    fire that never shall be quenched:</font><br>
    Mark 9:46 <font color="#FF0000">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</font><br>
    Mark 9:47 <font color="#FF0000">And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee
    to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be
    cast into hell fire:</font><br>
    Mark 9:48 <font color="#FF0000">Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</font></p>
    <p>Jer 17:27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day,
    and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the
    sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall
    devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The key to understanding the phrase <em>unquenchable fire</em> is in the
  last quote, Jer 17:27. Israel did not heed the warning and as a result
  Jerusalem and the Temple of God were burned to the ground by Nebuchadnezzar
  (See II Kings 25:8,9). Is Jerusalem burning today? Obviously not. An
  unquenchable fire clearly does not burn forever. So what does the phrase mean?
  A fire that cannot be quenched burns until its divine purpose has been
  accomplished <em>and then it goes out.</em> Man cannot extinguish or quench
  the fire, but it does indeed go out when there is nothing left to burn.</p>
  <p><b><u>Everlasting Punishment?</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 25:46 <font color="#FF0000">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
    righteous into life eternal.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The destruction of the wicked in the lake of fire is permanent. It is a
  punishment that cannot be reversed. The act of punishing will come to an end,
  but the consequences will last for eternity.</p>
  <p><b><u>Everlasting Destruction?</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 1:8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and
    that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
    2 Th 1:9 Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
    presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By now the pattern should be clear. Does this passage speak of the fiery
  act of destruction of the wicked as continuing forever? No, as we have seen in
  the preceding passages the fire will indeed go out, but the destruction caused
  by the fire is everlasting. The actual act of destruction is relatively brief,
  but the destruction caused by the lake of fire will be permanent. So once the
  lake of fire has done its destruction, the process is over, forever. That is
  what is meant by everlasting destruction.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 10:28 <font color="#FF0000">And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
    the soul: but rather fear him (God) which is able to destroy both soul and
    body in hell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What could be more clear? God will destroy the soul (life) and body of the
  wicked in hell (the second death or lake of fire). It will be <em>complete</em>
  destruction of the wicked.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
    shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</p>
    <p>Psa 37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
    be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume
    away.</p>
  <p>Psa 37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the 
  wicked shall be cut off.</p>
  <p>Psa 92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of 
  iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:</p>
  <p>Psa 104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked 
  be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all
    the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that
    cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them
    neither root nor branch.<br>
    Mal 4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
    with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of
    the stall.<br>
    Mal 4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under
    the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of
    hosts.</p>
    <p>Isa 47:14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
    they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall
    not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So clearly, when the all the above passages are considered in total, the
  fate of Satan as well as the wicked is destruction, complete and eternal
  destruction, not an eternal life of torture and torment. The lake of fire
  (hell fire) will be an unquenchable fire. It <em>is</em> complete destruction,
  but <em>not</em> eternal fire. It will burn until its divine purpose of
  destroying the chaff (the wicked) has been accomplished, and then it will go
  out, and there will not be so much as a warm coal remaining.</p>
  <p>Now before you come to the conclusion that I don't believe in Hell, let me
  say that I most certainly do, but it is clear that Hell's fire is a lot hotter
  than most Christians believe. Scripture makes it clear that Hell's fire is so
  hot that Satan and all the wicked will completely burn to ashes like stubble.
  They will be cut off and cease to exist! There <em>will</em> be punishing torment in the lake
  of fire, but <em>that torment will come to an end</em>, and the fire will go
  out when the wicked are destroyed by the second death.</p>
  <p><b><u>The Tree of Life and Immortality.</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
    to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of
    the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
    Gen 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to
    till the ground from whence he was taken.<br>
    Gen 3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of
    Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way
    of the tree of life.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Adam and Eve were expelled from the garden of Eden specifically so they
  could not eat from the tree of life and live forever a life of sin. To eat
  from the tree of life is to live forever, so had Adam and Eve eaten from that
  tree, sin would have existed forever, and could never come to an end. As a
  result of this deprivation, Adam and Eve and all of humanity were condemned to
  die. However, after their resurrection, the faithful people of God will again
  be permitted to eat from the tree of life:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 2:7 <font color="#FF0000">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
    churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life,
    which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
    right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the righteous will live forever because they will be given access to the
  tree of life, which will be in the New Jerusalem (Rev 22:2). Will the wicked
  live forever without such access? No. Eternal life in perpetual torment for
  sinners is simply <em>not possible</em> because they will not be able to
  partake of the tree of life.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
    river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and
    yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the
    healing of the nations.<br>
    Rev 22:3 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the
    Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No more curse means no more death, no more sin, no more sinners, no more
  sickness, no more graves. This verse is not limited to just heaven or the New
  Jerusalem, it is describing the entire universe. The universe will return to a
  state of complete perfection, as it was before Satan's rebellion.</p>
  <p><b><u>The Rich Man and Lazarus</u></b></p>
  <p>Many will try to use Luke 16:19-31 as proof that there is conscious life
  after death, and that there is a place of eternal torment (Hell). It is
  important to point out that Luke 16:19-31 is the fifth in a series of parables
  as follows -
  <ul>
    <p>1. The lost sheep - Luke 15:3-7<br>
    2. The lost coin - Luke 15:8-10<br>
    3. The lost boy - Luke 15:11-32<br>
    4. The unjust steward - Luke 16:1-13<br>
    5. The rich man and Lazarus - Luke 16:19-31</p>
  </ul>
  <p>Parables are designed to teach great moral principles. Each feature of the
  parable is not to be taken absolutely literally. The question in each parable
  is what are the great moral lessons. We get into deep trouble if we attempt to
  take each detail of the parable literally rather than seek the lesson that
  Jesus is trying to teach. Let's go ahead and assume for a moment that the
  parable of the rich man and Lazarus is a literally true story-
  <ul>
    <li>Do people actually have conversations between Heaven and Hell?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Can those in heaven see people burning in Hell?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Can they hear their screams?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Would a finger dipped in water actually lessen the torment of another?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Abraham must have a very large bosom to contain all the individuals who
      go there!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Heaven would be a terrible place if we beheld the constant, ever present
  suffering of our friends for all of eternity. So, why did Jesus use this story
  and tell it as He did? What lesson(s) was He trying to teach?</p>
  <p>The Jews had a common story describing death as passing through a valley of 
  darkness and they pictured salvation as fleeing to the security of Abraham's 
  bosom. The Jews also believed that riches were a sign of God's favor and 
  poverty a sign of His displeasure. The rich man living sumptuously represents the Jews, who had 
  access to the word of God but refused to share it. They were squandering and 
  wasting the spiritual riches for which they were the stewards, as in the 
  previous parable of the unjust steward. The Jews were the fig tree that bore 
  no fruit (Mark 11:13-14, 20, Luke 13:6-9), and the husbandmen of the 
  unproductive vineyard (Matt. 21:33-45, Mark 12:1-12, Luke 20:9-19). Lazarus represents the Gentiles, who the Jews 
  would not minister to. So the rich man in the story, whom the Jews thought 
  blessed of God, ends up in Hell, while the poor Lazarus is saved and greeted 
  by Abraham. Jesus had reversed the outcome from what the Jews expected. This 
  is why Jesus used the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in the way he did. 
  It was not intended to convey the exact circumstances of Heaven or Hell, but 
  rather to show to the Jews that they had grave misconceptions about who was 
  saved and who was lost.</p>
  <p>These are the main points the parable teaches:</p>
  <p>1. Like the parable of the talents (Matt 25:14-30), the unprofitable 
  servant who squanders what the Lord has given him will be lost. </p>
  <p>2. Riches gained by greed, dishonesty or oppressing the poor are not a sign 
  of God's favor. Wealth is simply not an indicator of one's salvation.</p>
  <p>3. The parable describes a great fixed gulf between the saved and the lost.
  Jesus clearly communicated that there is no second chance after death. The
  decision made in life determines our eternal destiny, and it simply cannot be
  changed after death.</p>
  <p>4. Jesus points out that if the Pharisees rejected the clear teachings of
  God's word regarding salvation, they would also reject such a mighty,
  supernatural spectacular miracle as one being raised from the dead.</p>
  <p>Note that a short while later in John 11:11-14,43,44 Jesus raised Lazarus
  from the dead. As a result the Pharisees and chief priests plotted to kill
  Jesus (John 11:53) and Lazarus (John 12:10). So the words of Jesus in Luke 16:31 were indeed
  prophetic and fulfilled.</p>
  <p>So parables are not meant to be taken literally as written. You must read
  beyond the literal text to see the important principle or lesson(s) being
  taught.</p>
  <p><b><u>Our God is a Consuming Fire</u></b></p>
  <p>Now I would like to pursue another line of thinking- the glory of God, and
  how it relates to this subject. Starting in the book of Matthew-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 24:30 <font color="#FF0000">And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and
    then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of
    man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 9:26 <font color="#FF0000">For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him
    shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in
    his Father's, and of the holy angels.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And then Revelation-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
    they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
    because of him. Even so, Amen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The key point to note here is that when Jesus next returns at His second
  advent, He comes in all his glory and every living person on earth (all the
  tribes and every eye) will see that glory. So how is that significant? Note
  the following-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
    consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness
    of his coming:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because Jesus will return in all His glory, His brightness will consume the
  man of sin (the antichrist). Sin and wickedness cannot look on the full glory
  of Jesus. It is destroyed.</p>
  <p>Note what Jesus had to say when Moses asked Him to see His glory in the
  book of Exodus-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man
    see me, and live.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>No man in a sinful fallen state can see the face of Jesus in it's full
  glory and live. To do so means instant death.</p>
  <p>Now note the following verses-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 24:17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
    on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.</p>
    <p>Isa 4:4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
    of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof
    by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.<br>
    Isa 4:5 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion,
    and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a
    flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.</p>
    <p>Isa 30:27 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
    anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation,
    and his tongue as a devouring fire:</p>
    <p>Deu 4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.</p>
    <p>Heb 12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If our God is a devouring and consuming fire, then what exactly does he
  consume? From the verses we have already looked at it should be clear. Sin,
  wickedness, and unrighteousness are consumed by the fire of the full glory of
  God.</p>
  <p>Now what follows builds on everything we have looked at so far. Note the
  words of Isaiah-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 33:14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
    hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us
    shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The question is asked, who will be able to dwell with the devouring fire,
  the everlasting burnings? Who is this consuming fire? As I have already shown
  it speaks about God himself, He is the eternally burning fire. Now for the
  answer to the question posed in verse 14-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 33:15 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
    despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of
    bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes
    from seeing evil;<br>
    Isa 33:16 (KJV) He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
    munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.<br>
    Isa 33:17 (KJV) Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall
    behold the land that is very far off.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Amazing! It is the RIGHTEOUS that will be able to dwell forever with
  eternal consuming fire! The RIGHTEOUS will see Him in all His beauty and His
  fully burning glory for all of eternity! Where God is in his full glory, there
  is an eternal consuming fire so great that sin cannot exist. The blazing glory
  of Jesus will expose and consume all sinners like stubble. Only the righteous
  will remain.</p>
  <p>Now think about this for a moment. Satan had lived with God as a covering
  cherub and was able to talk to and look upon the face of God. Then iniquity
  was found in him, and he rebelled against God and his law. Satan considered
  the law and rule of God as confining, oppressive, and most unreasonable. To
  Satan, heaven had become a place of torment, filled with the eternal fire of
  the presence of God, something Satan could no longer tolerate in his
  rebellious pride. To Satan, heaven had become what people today describe as
  --- Hell.</p>
  <p>So the description that the Catholic church (and much of Christianity) uses
  for Hell is actually Satan's concept of heaven!</p>
  <p>DUE TO FALSE CATHOLIC TEACHING, CHRISTIANITY TODAY FEARS A PLACE OF ETERNAL
  FIRE, WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW THE BIBLE DESCRIBES THE PRESENCE OF GOD IN ALL HIS
  GLORY IN HEAVEN.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:16 <font color="#FF0000">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
    that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
    life.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John 3:16 rings more true, and exposes more lies that you probably ever
  thought! ONLY the righteous will receive eternal life. Hell as taught by most
  of the Christian world is pure fiction and is not taught by the Bible.</p>
  <p>Now, I believe that you know the biblical truth.</p>
