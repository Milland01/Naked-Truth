<blockquote>
  <p>Pope Benedict XVI, when meeting the new ambassador of the Philippines to 
  the Holy See on October 27th, 2008, made this amazing statement regarding 
  church and state:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The Catholic Church is eager to share the richness of the Gospel’s social 
  message, for it enlivens hearts with a hope for the fulfillment of justice and 
  a love that makes all men and women truly brothers and sisters in Christ 
  Jesus,&quot; the Pontiff stated. &quot;She carries out this mission fully aware of the 
  respective autonomy and competence of Church and State. Indeed, we may say 
  that the distinction between religion and politics is a specific achievement 
  of Christianity and one of its fundamental historical and cultural 
  contributions.&quot; <font face="Times New Roman">—</font> <b> <a href="http://www.zenit.org/rssenglish-24079">Zenit</a></b>. 
  (<a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-24078?l=english">full text of the Pope's remarks</a>)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What makes this so remarkable? Note that the pontiff was meeting with an 
  ambassador to the Holy See. This is because Benedict XVI is the head of the 
  papal state (the king or monarch of the Holy See). At the same time he holds 
  the highest ecclesiastical office in the Roman Catholic Church, that of Pope. 
  This makes the <a href="vatican.html">Vatican</a> the 
  epitome of church and state combined.</p>
  <p>Relatively recent events in some countries of the world have also given the 
  Catholic Church the opportunity to give the appearance of being the champion 
  of religious freedom. For example, the Catholic Church has officially 
  protested the new legislation in Russia that is designed to restrict the 
  freedom of some religious groups. And in Cuba, the communist government of 
  Fidel Castro permitted the celebration of Christmas in 1997, for the first 
  time in many years, as a concession to the impending papal visit.</p>
  <p>Catholics can even point to Pope John Paul II's <strong>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <em>
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP960218.HTM">Angelus Message</a>

  Religious Freedom, </em><strong><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/V2RELFRE.HTM"><em>Dignitatis 
  Humanae</em></a></strong>, promulgated by Pope Paul VI on December 7, 1965, as 
  proof that the Catholic Church staunchly supports religious freedom. When Catholics and Catholicism are the subject of repression and 
  persecution, as they have been in Communist states during the 20th century, 
  you can be assured that they will champion religious freedom. But has this 
  also been the case when Catholicism has been the dominant religion, in a 
  position to exert her influence, and even persecute what they call &quot;heretics&quot; 
  via the secular authorities? What has been the historical position of the 
  Catholic Church on religious freedom and the separation of church and state?</p>

  </table>
  <p>Pius IX is advocating in the above passage that society <em>should</em> be 
  governed in such as way as to discriminate between the &quot;true religion&quot; 
  (Catholicism) and &quot;false religion&quot; (all non-Catholics). Pius IX continues:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>And, against the doctrine of Scripture, of the Church, and of the Holy 
    Fathers, they do not hesitate to assert that &quot;that is the best condition of 
    civil society, in which no duty is recognized, as attached to the civil 
    power, of restraining by enacted penalties, offenders against the Catholic 
    religion, except so far as public peace may require.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So heretics, according to Pius IX, maintain that the Catholic Church has no 
  right to compel secular civil authorities to arrest and prosecute 
  anti-Catholic protesters, with the exception of instances of public disorder. 
  In short, heretics advocate religious freedom.</p>
  <p>Now Pius IX clarifies his view further:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>From which totally false idea of social government they do not fear to 
    foster that erroneous opinion, most fatal in its effects on the Catholic 
    Church and the salvation of souls, called by Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, 
    an &quot;insanity,&quot;* [<sup>2</sup>] viz., that &quot;liberty of conscience and worship 
    is each man's personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and 
    asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in 
    the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no 
    authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly 
    and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by 
    word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.&quot;</p>
    <p><sup>2.</sup> Gregory XVI, encyclical epistle &quot;Mirari vos,&quot; 15 August 
    1832.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The assertion has just been made by two Popes that the concepts of 
  religious liberty and freedom of speech are nothing less than &quot;insanity&quot;, and 
  that Catholic and civil authorities have the right to restrict and abolish all 
  rights of anyone who is not Catholic. He also considers such principles of 
  liberty as <em>fatal blows</em> to the Catholic faith, that the Catholic faith 
  cannot survive in an atmosphere of freedom, but rather only by resorting to 
  repression and persecution as directed by the Church.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>But, while they rashly affirm this, they do not think and consider that 
    they are preaching &quot;liberty of perdition;&quot;[3] and that &quot;if human arguments 
    are always allowed free room for discussion, there will never be wanting men 
    who will dare to resist truth, and to trust in the flowing speech of human 
    wisdom; whereas we know, from the very teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
    how carefully Christian faith and wisdom should avoid this most injurious 
    babbling.&quot;[4]</p>
    <p>3. St. Augustine, epistle 105 (166).<br>
    4. St. Leo, epistle 14 (133), sect. 2, edit. Ball.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Religious liberty is equated here with lawlessness and chaos (perdition). 
  What is advocated here is nothing less than the abolishing of freedom of 
  religion and freedom of speech.</p>
  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>*It is interesting to note that in Quanta Cura, Pope Pius IX makes a point 
  of quoting Pope Gregory XVI as using the word &quot;insanity&quot; in describing the 
  principle of religious liberty in <em>Mirari vos</em>, yet if you check <em>
  Mirari vos</em> at Catholic sources on the web, you will discover the word has 
  been removed from the text. I offer the translation of <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <strong>
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/G16MIRAR.HTM">Mirari vos</a>
  </strong>at EWTN as one example of this kind of politically correct historical 
  revisionism that attempts to take the edge off past papal remarks and make 
  them appear more palatable. Here is an apparently more accurate translation of 
  what Gregory XVI actually said in section 14 of <em>Mirari vos</em>, and below 
  it is what EWTN's version says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>14. And from this most putrid font of indifferentism flows that absurd 
    and erroneous view, or rather insanity, that liberty of conscience should be 
    asserted and claimed for just anyone.</p>
    <p>[EWTN] 14. This shameful font of indifferentism gives rise to that absurd 
    and erroneous proposition which claims that liberty of conscience must be 
    maintained for everyone.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If the Catholics cannot present their own history faithfully, then how can 
  anything they say be considered trustworthy? They claim to be the sole 
  authority for interpreting scripture, yet apparently cannot even translate 
  their papal documents accurately. Perhaps Catholic translations of papal 
  encyclicals should be considered as &quot;edited for political correctness&quot; until 
  other sources are consulted.</p>
  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>Released at the same time as the encyclical <em>Quanta Cura</em>, Pius IX 
  issued a list or Syllabus of Errors. The following statements are from that 
  syllabus and are condemned as being in error:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>15. Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided 
    by the light of reason, he shall consider true.-- Allocution Maxima quidem, 
    June 9, 1862; Damnatio Multiplices inter, June 10, 1851.</p>
    <p>16. Man may, in the observance of any religion whatever, find the way of 
    eternal salvation, and arrive at eternal salvation.-- Encyclical Qui 
    pluribus, Nov. 9, 1846.</p>
    <p>17. Good hope at least is to be entertained of the eternal salvation of 
    all those who are not at all in the true Church of Christ.--Encyclical 
    Quanto conficiamur, Aug. 10, 1863, etc.</p>
    <p>18. Protestantism is nothing more than another form of the same true 
    Christian religion, in which form it is given to please God equally as in 
    the Catholic Church.--Encyclical Noscitis, Dec. 8, 1849.</p>
    <p>24. The Church has not the power of using force, nor has she any temporal 
    power, direct or indirect.—Apostolic Letter &quot;Ad Apostolicae,&quot; Aug. 22, 1851.</p>
    <p>55. The Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from 
    the Church.--Allocution Acerbissimum, Sept. 27, 1852.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because the above are errors, Pius IX is actually saying:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>15. No man is entitled to freedom of religion.<br>
    16-18. Salvation is found only in the Catholic Church, and not in any other 
    denomination, to include Protestantism.<br>
    24. The Catholic Church may employ force to achieve her ends.<br>
    55. Church and State should be united as one.</p>

  <p align="center">Excerpts from LIBERTAS PRAESTANTISSIMUM<br>
  ON THE NATURE OF HUMAN LIBERTY<br>
  ENCYCLICAL OF POPE LEO XIII JUNE 20, 1888</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>23. We must now consider briefly liberty of speech, and liberty of the 
    press. It is hardly necessary to say that there can be no such right as 
    this, if it be not used in moderation, and if it pass beyond the bounds and 
    end of all true liberty. For right is a moral power which -- as We have 
    before said and must again and again repeat -- it is absurd to suppose that 
    nature has accorded indifferently to truth and falsehood, to justice and 
    injustice. Men have a right freely and prudently to propagate throughout the 
    State what things soever are true and honorable, so that as many as possible 
    may possess them; but lying opinions, than which no mental plague is 
    greater, and vices which corrupt the heart and moral life should be 
    diligently repressed by public authority, lest they insidiously work the 
    ruin of the State.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, just who do you think Pope Leo XIII believes has the right and 
  authority to regulate both speech and the press to assure that only &quot;the 
  truth&quot; is presented?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>27. In faith and in the teaching of morality, God Himself made the Church 
    a partaker of His divine authority, and through His heavenly gift she cannot 
    be deceived. She is therefore the greatest and most reliable teacher of 
    mankind, and in her swells an inviolable right to teach them. Sustained by 
    the truth received from her divine Founder, the Church has ever sought to 
    fulfill holily the mission entrusted to her by God; unconquered by the 
    difficulties on all sides surrounding her, she has never ceased to assert 
    her liberty of teaching, and in this way the wretched superstition of 
    paganism being dispelled, the wide world was renewed unto Christian wisdom. 
    Now, reason itself clearly teaches that the truths of divine revelation and 
    those of nature cannot really be opposed to one another, and that whatever 
    is at variance with them must necessarily be false. Therefore, the divine 
    teaching of the Church, so far from being an obstacle to the pursuit of 
    learning and the progress of science, or in any way retarding the advance of 
    civilization, in reality brings to them the sure guidance of shining light. 
    And for the same reason it is of no small advantage for the perfecting of 
    human liberty, since our Savior Jesus Christ has said that by truth is man 
    made free: &quot;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot; [Jn 
    8:32] Therefore, there is no reason why genuine liberty should grow 
    indignant, or true science feel aggrieved, at having to bear the just and 
    necessary restraint of laws by which, in the judgment of the Church and of 
    reason itself, human teaching has to be controlled.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that Pope Leo XIII is saying that the Catholic Church should be the 
  judge of which laws are appropriate to restrain human liberty. The ultimate 
  result of this is governmental persecution of heretics pointed out by church 
  authorities, as amply demonstrated by European and Catholic history.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>42. From what has been said it follows that it is quite unlawful to 
    demand, to defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, of speech, 
    or writing, or of worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature 
    to man. For, if nature had really granted them, it would be lawful to refuse 
    obedience to God, and there would be no restraint on human liberty. It 
    likewise follows that freedom in these things may be tolerated wherever 
    there is just cause, but only with such moderation as will prevent its 
    degenerating into license and excess. And, where such liberties are in use, 
    men should employ them in doing good, and should estimate them as the Church 
    does; for liberty is to be regarded as legitimate in so far only as it 
    affords greater facility for doing good, but no farther.</p>
