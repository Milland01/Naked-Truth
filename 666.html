<hr align="center">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and
poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
foreheads:<br>
Rev 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,
or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.<br>
Rev 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is <i>Six
hundred threescore and six</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that according to verse 17, there are three different
characteristics that distinguish the beast: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>his mark (of authority) </li>
    <li>his name </li>
    <li>the number of his name (666).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It might be argued by some that 666 must be applied to one man's
name, and that this will then help identify him as <em>the</em>
antichrist. I would offer the following verse to show that 666 need not
apply solely to a man's name:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name
written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The same Greek word translated as name (onoma: G3686) that appears
in Revelation 13:17-18 is also used in chapter 19:16, so clearly the
word can also apply to a <em>title</em>, and not just one man's name.
Now, we are told that it takes a certain <em>understanding</em> and
wisdom to discern just how this number is actually applied. Based on
the fact that 666 can apply to a title, below are several words and
phrases that have been put forth over the centuries as probable
solutions to the enigma of 666.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Latin is the official language of the Roman Catholic Church.
Church Documents are usually published first in Latin, and then
translated from the Latin into other languages. The association of
"Lateinos" with 666 was first suggested by Irenæus (ca. 130-202 A.D.)
who proposed in his <i>Against Heresies</i> that it might be the name
of the fourth kingdom in Daniel 7:7.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Then also Lateinos has the number six hundred and sixty-six; and
it is a very probable [solution], this being the name of the last
kingdom [of the four seen by Daniel]. For the Latins are they who at
present bear rule: I will not, however, make any boast over this
[coincidence].</p>

  <hr>
  <p>This relationship of 666 in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew is only one
relatively small, yet important indicator that the Papacy is the
Antichrist and the beast from the sea of Revelation 13. This
association by itself proves little, as 666 can fit other people using
the same methods. All the other biblical characteristics of the
Antichrist must be considered and met as well, then this association
becomes significant.&nbsp;</p>
  <hr>An objection has been raised that the method of gematria used
above to calculate the Roman numeral value of phrases is incorrect. The
word VICARIUS it is argued, must be calculated with letters grouped as
follows: VI=6 C=100 A=0 R=0 IU= 4 S=0, for a value of only 110, instead
of 112. This is patently incorrect. The value of each individual letter
is to be added to yield a total value. It is totally irrelevant to the
calculation if adjacent letters can be combined in groups to give a
value. This assertion that letters must be grouped is nothing but sheer
nonsense.
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><b><u>666 and CÆSAR NERO</u></b></p>
  <p>Some will suggest that the book of Revelation was written only for
those living at the time, and that 666 most probably applies to Cæsar
Nero, who ruled Rome from 54 to 68 A.D., rather than someone from
latter centuries. This point of view, which suggests Revelation had an
immediate application to the first century, rather than being
prophetic, is known as <i>preterism</i>, and is commonly held by the
Catholic Church. So, just how is Nero linked to 666?</p>
  <p>The preterist takes a relatively uncommon form of Nero's name,
Nero Cæsar or Cæsar Nero, and adds an "n", resulting in Neron Cæsar.
Next the Latin is transliterated into Aramaic, resulting in <i>nrwn
qsr,</i> which when using the numeric equivalent of the letters, then
adds up to 666 as follows:</p>

  <p>An example of this spelling has apparently been recently
discovered in one of the Dead Sea scrolls. If you use the same process,
but without the added "n" the result is 616. Interestingly, some early
manuscripts have 616 rather than 666, but even scholars such as Irenæus
[A.D. 120-202] attribute the 616 to only a copyist error (<a
 href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxi.html">Against
Heresies: Book V <font size="3">Chapter XXX.</font></a><font size="3">),
"</font>this number [666] being found in all the most approved and
ancient copies" [of the Apocalypse]<font size="3"> and asserts that "</font>men
who saw John face to face bearing their testimony" [to it - 666].</p>
  <p>There is a problem though with the above calculation. According to
the rules of Jewish numerology, known as <i>gematria</i>, when the
letter Nun appears a second time in a word, it is known as a "Final",
and takes the value of 700.* So to be precise, NRWN QSR actually adds
up to 1316 and not 666.</p>
  <p>*Source: Behind Numerology, by Shirley Blackwell Lawrence,
copyright 1989, published by Newcastle Publishing Co., Inc., North
Hollywood, California, ISBN 0-87877-145-X, page 41.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> So the preterist calculation which
attributes 666 to Nero, however, is nothing more than a rather
desperate attempt to find some likely candidate for the Antichrist
other than the Papacy.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp; <b><u>THE WORD ANTI-</u></b></p>
  <p>Look up in Strong's Concordance word 473 in the Greek dictionary.
You will find the the word anti is often used to denote substitution-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>473. anti, an-tee'; a prim. particle; opposite, i.e. instead or
because of (rarely in addition to):--for, in the room of. Often used in
composition to denote contrast, requital, *substitution*,
correspondence, etc.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>An example of how anti is used this way can be found in the words
type and antitype, which are used with respect to Bible prophecy. The
"type" is the pattern or symbol, and the antitype is the fulfillment.
The Jewish Passover was a "type" and the crucifixion of Jesus is the
"antitype" or fulfillment of the example of the type. You substitute
the antitype into the symbolism of the type to arrive at the complete
meaning.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> The Catholic Church has essentially
confirmed this usage of the word anti. In the 1994 <i>Catholic Almanac</i>
on page 158 there is "the list of men who claimed or exercised the
papal office in an uncanonical manner." So these men tried to
substitute themselves for the true Pope, and usurp that office, so to
speak. The Catholic church denies the papal authority of the men on
that list because they attempted a substitute (false) claim on the
Papacy. That list is a list of ANTI-POPES! So the word anti can clearly
mean a substitute for something.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<b><u>THE WORD ANTICHRIST</u></b></p>
  <p>Antichrist (word 500 in Strong's Greek dictionary) can be
correctly interpreted then, as someone who substitutes himself for
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, just as an antipope substituted himself
into the office of the Papacy.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><font size="4">The Vicar of Christ (Vicarius
Christi)</font></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Vicar of Christ . . . Title used almost exclusively of the
Bishop of Rome as successor of Peter and, therefore, the one in the
Church who particularly takes the place of Christ; but used also of
bishops in general and even of priests. First used by the Roman Synod
of A.D. 495 to refer to Pope Gelasius; more commonly in Roman curial
usage to refer to the Bishop of Rome during the pontificate of Pope
Eugene III (1145-1153). Pope Innocent III (1198-1216) asserted
explicitly that the Pope is the Vicar of Christ; further defined at the
Council of Florence in the <i>Decree for the Greeks</i> (1439) and
Vatican Council I in <i>Pastor Aerternus</i> (1870). The Second
Vatican Council, in <i>Lumen Gentium</i> , n.27, calls bishops in
general "vicars and legates of Christ." All bishops are vicars of
Christ for their local churches in their ministerial functions as
priest, prophet, and king, as the Pope is for the universal church; the
title further denotes they exercise their authority in the Church not
by delegation from any other person, but from Christ Himself." </p>
    <p>Source: <i>Catholic Dictionary</i>, Peter M.J. Stravinskas,
Editor, published by Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., Huntington, 1993, pp.
484-485.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><u>THE WORDS VICARIOUS AND VICAR</u></b></p>
  <p>Now look up the word vicarious in almost any common dictionary.
Here is what you would find in the <i>Webster Handy College Dictionary</i>:
"substituting for or, feeling in place of another."</p>
  <p>Also in the <i>Webster's II New Riverside Desk Dictionary</i> for
the definition of Vicar-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. A parish priest in the Church of England.<br>
2. A cleric in the Episcopal Church in charge of a chapel.<br>
3. One who serves as a *substitute* for another.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A Vicar General is defined in the 1994 Catholic Almanac on page
330 as "a priest or bishop appointed by the bishop of a diocese to
serve as his deputy, with ordinary executive power, in the
administration of the diocese." So a vicar serves in the place of
(substituting for) the bishop, and assumes his power of office for
certain duties. </p>
  <p>So the Papal title of VICAR OF CHRIST which in Latin is VICARIUS
CHRISTI, means a SUBSTITUTE FOR CHRIST, which is synonymous with
Antichrist, i.e., assuming the power of God on earth! This blasphemous
claim is made repeatedly by various Popes and is the very foundation of
Roman Catholicism and it's Papacy.</p>
  <p>Some Catholics may protest that the Pope represents, but does not
substitute for Jesus Christ, to avoid the association.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Now, from the Webster Hand College Dictionary, the
definition of the word represent:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. portray; depict; describe.<br>
2. play the role of; impersonate.<br>
3. denote; symbolize; stand for.<br>
4. speak and act for; *be a substitute for*.<br>
5. set forth; assert.<br>
6. be composed of; consist in.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly then, Vicar of Christ (Vicarius Christi) and Antichrist
have exactly the same meaning. The Pope substitutes himself in place of
God on earth, and that is *exactly* the meaning of Antichrist.</p>

Some Catholics will claim that the title VICARIUS FILII DEI is an
anti-catholic fabrication, a complete fake, <em>never</em> used by the
Catholic church. One example of this was online at the Catholic <strong>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.envoymagazine.com/">Envoy Magazine</a></strong>
in the article titled<strong> <a
 href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031002094908/http://www.envoymagazine.com/backissues/2.2/mar_apr98_coverstory.html">Pope
Fiction</a></strong> by Patrick Madrid (See Fiction 5). <b> <a
 href="envoy.html">My complete discussion with Patrick Madrid</a></b>.&nbsp;
  <p>Another Catholic apologist, Karl Keating of the organization <a
 href="http://www.catholic.com/">Catholic Answers</a>, in a debate in
the fall of 1989 with Jose Ventilacion of <em>Iglesia ni Cristo, </em>stated
the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em style="font-style: normal;">The whole Iglesia argument
against the Catholic Church is a big fraud, and let me prove it to </em><em>you</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;">, from </em> <em>Pasugo</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;"> [</em><i>God's Message</i>]<em
 style="font-style: normal;">. I mentioned in my opening remarks,
Iglesia is </em><em>so</em><em style="font-style: normal;"> fond of
claiming that the Pope is the beast of Revelation. We know that the
beast of Revelation has the number 666, right? </em></p>
    <p><em style="font-style: normal;">Now here is the argument, follow
this carefully. The Pope's have what is known as a tiara, that means a
triple crown, a triply high crown, three levels. The beast can be
identified. You find a man whose name, when added up adds up to 666, or
a man whose title adds up to 666. Now, Iglesia ni Cristo says two
things. One, that the title of the Pope, in Latin, is Vicarius Filii
Dei, and second, that that title appears on the three bands of the
tiara. I have in front of me a photo copy of the September 1976 issue
of </em><em>Pasugo</em><em style="font-style: normal;">. Here is a
drawing made by the staff showing the tiara with those words on it.
This is just a pen drawing. Two things to say. Does the title Vicarius
Filii Dei add up to 666? Yes it does. But, is that a title of the
Popes? Have they </em><em>ever</em><em style="font-style: normal;">
used it? No. </em></p>
    <p><em style="font-style: normal;">Do you know what Vicarius Filii
Dei means? It means vicar, or representative, or agent, Vicar of the
Son of God. The Pope has </em><em>never</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;"> used that title. </em><em>No Pope ever</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;">. The official title of the pope, one of
several, is Vicar of Christ, </em><em>not</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;"> Vicar of the Son of God. We Catholics
claim he is the representative on earth of the God-man the Messiah, </em><em>not</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;"> of the second person of the Trinity as
such. But you see, the Vicar of Christ, in Latin, is Vicarius Christi,
and when you add up the letters, they don't add up to 666. </em></p>
    <p><em style="font-style: normal;">So the first thing, the first
thing, that the Iglesia ni Cristo has done, and as I say, it repeats
this </em><em>story</em><em style="font-style: normal;"> every four
issues or so in its magazine. The first thing is to claim that the
title of the Pope is Vicarius Filii Dei. </em> <em>That's a lie.</em><em
 style="font-style: normal;"> It's not at all. Why does it claim that? </em><em>Because
it wants to find a title that adds up to 666. It doesn't care about the
truth!</em></p>
Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDA1F0Ydztg">
video on YouTube</a>. <br>
H<em style="font-style: normal;">ere is <a
 href="keating-vfd.mp3">audio of the above quote
(mp3)</a>. <br>
Mr. Keating also stated this in print: </em><i> "Vicarius Filii Dei</i>
never has been used as a title by any Pope.", <i><b>Catholicism and
Fundamentalism</b>, </i>by Karl Keating, Ignatius Press, 1988, <a

The<b> <i><a
 href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/donatconst.html">Donation
of Constantine</a></i> </b>is the most famous forgery in European
history, and was discovered in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals in the
9th century (c. 847-853). The forger is thought to have been <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Hymonides">Johannes
Hymonides</a><b> (</b>John the Deacon of the 9th century). The
Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals are fictitious letters alleged to be from
early popes [Clement (A.D. 100) to Gregory the Great (A.D. 600)],
collected by Isidore Mercator in the 9th century. Since the scholarly
criticism of the fifteenth century they have been known to be forgeries
and have been called "Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals" or False Decretals,
to acknowledge that they are fraudulent.
  <p>The donation reads in part as follows in Latin: (caps added for
emphasis) -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... ut sicut B. Petrus in terris VICARIUS FILII DEI esse videtur
constitutus, ita et Pontifices, qui ipsius principis apostolorum gerunt
vices, principatus potestatem amplius quam terrena imperialis nostrae
serenitatis mansuetudo habere videtur, conscessam a nobis nostroque
imperio obtineant...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In English that is-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... as the Blessed Peter is seen to have been constituted vicar
of the Son of God on the earth, so the Pontiffs who are the
representatives of that same chief of the apostles, should obtain from
us and our empire the power of a supremacy greater than the clemency of
our earthly imperial serenity is seen to have conceded to it,<br>
(continuing beyond the Latin above)<br>
choosing that same chief of the apostles and his vicars to be our
constant intercessors with God. And to the extent of our earthly
Imperial power, we have decreed that his holy Roman Church shall be
honored with veneration, and that more than our empire and earthly
throne the most sacred seat of the Blessed Peter shall be gloriously
exalted, we giving to it power, and dignity of glory, and vigor, and
honor imperial. And we ordain and decree that he shall have the
supremacy as well over the four principal seats, Alexandria, Antioch,
Jerusalem, and Constantinople, as also over all the churches of God in
the whole earth. And the Pontiff, who at the time shall be at the head
of the holy Roman church itself, shall be more exalted than, and chief
over, all the priests of the whole world, and according to his judgment
everything which is provided for the service of God and for the
stability of the faith of Christians is to be administered.</p>

The Donation of Constantine has two parts, the first relates the
alleged conversion story of Constantine to the Christian faith, and is
called the "Confessio". The second part, called the "Donatio", lists
the authority, privileges and property bestowed on the papacy by the
emperor. It was later incorporated into most of the medieval
collections of Catholic canon law (Anselm's, Cardinal Deusdedit's <nobr>(c.
1087),</nobr> and Gratian's Decretum (c. 1148) also known as Concordia
Discordantium Canonum).

  <p>The Donation of Constantine was cited in writing by no less than
10 Popes as proof of their civil authority and sovereignty over Rome,
and what came to be known as the Papal States, which included a large
portion of Italy. It was also eventually exposed as a pious fraud in
1440 by <nobr>Laurentius Valla<b> </b></nobr>who proved the donation
had to have been written several centuries <i>after</i> the death of
Constantine (337 A.D.) The Vatican condemned Valla's scholarly work by
listing it in the <i><a href="ILP-1559.html#Valla"><b>Index
Librorum Prohibitorum</b></a></i>, the Index of Prohibited Books of
1559 (<a
 href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Qjo8AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum&amp;pg=PT46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">a
1569 printing at Google books</a>), and as late as 1580 the official
edition of the <i>Corpus Juris</i> upheld the genuineness of the False
Decretals. So the Donation of Constantine was held to be genuine for
centuries. </p>
  <p>Catholics finally abandoned the defense of the authenticity of the
Donation of Constantine shortly after <a
 href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02304b.htm">Cesare Baronius</a>
published his <i>Annales Ecclesiastici</i> in 1592, which admitted the
fraud, although the Donation and title Vicarius Filii Dei continued to
appear in Canon law and other Catholic publications well into the 19th
century. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> [Pg. 206] In his <i>Annales Ecclesiastici </i>(published
1588-1607) written in advocacy of the papacy and the Catholic Church,
he [Baronius] took the position that the falsity of the Donation had
been proven and, abandoning its defence, discussed it as a forgery.<sup>
2 <br>
    </sup>... <br>
[Pg. 207] ... Starting with his apologetic attitude on behalf of the
papacy, and the existence of Greek texts of the Donation, he advanced
the theory that Greeks had perpetrated the forgery and used it to
establish the antiquity of the See of Constantinople.<br>

Patriarch of Constantinople, he cites the "Donatio" to show that the
Holy See possessed both an earthly and a heavenly <i>imperium</i>, the
royal priesthood. ... Gregory VII himself never quoted this document in
his long warfare for ecclesiastical liberty against the secular power.
But Urban II made use of it in 1091 to support his claims on the island
of Corsica. Later popes (Innocent III, Gregory IX, Innocent IV) took
its authority for granted (Innocent III, <a

writers often adduced its evidence in favour of the papacy. The
medieval adversaries of the popes, on the other hand, never denied the
validity of this appeal to the pretended donation of Constantine ...
The authenticity of the document, as already stated, was doubted by no
one before the fifteenth century.</big></p>

Tracts Against Popery</a></i></b>, by Michael Geddes, LL.D., London,
1715. See pages 12 - 20. </big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big> In this letter, <u>which the
1913 <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> deems an official act</u>, Pope Leo
IX was asserting his primacy as the Bishop of Rome, and to that end he
reproduced that portion of the donation containing vicarius filii Dei
(see page 12 at left below) for the edification of the Greek Patriarch.
In the prologue of his citation of the donation, Leo IX said, in
affirming the donation as genuine:<img
 src="Geddes-p12.gif" alt="page"
 style="height: 508px; width: 300px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"
 align="left" border="0" hspace="12" vspace="12"></big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big> "But lest perhaps", saith <i>Leo</i>,
"some Scruple may still remain with you concerning it's earthly
Domination, (that is the Papacy's) and that you may not so much as
lightly suspect, that the holy <i>Roman</i> See seeks to vindicate and
defend its unshaken Honour with foolish and old Wives Fables, we will
here produce a few Privileges which were confirmed by the Hand of the
said <i>Constantine</i>, ... by which Truth will be confirmed, ... <i>we
do not follow learned Fables, but do manifest unto you the Power of Our
Lord Jesus Christ </i>[2 Pet. 1:16], ... Know ye that the same
glorious Prince in the aforesaid Privilege, did, ... thus promulgate
the special Dignity of the <i>Roman</i> Church". (pgs. 18, 19)</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <big> </big>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big> As Geddes says:</big></p>
  <big> </big>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was there
ever any Truth spoke of with more Assurance, or with a greater Air of
Devotion, than <i>Constantine's</i> Donation, and the <i>Roman</i>
Church's never having made use of Fables, as spoke of here by <i>Leo</i>."&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As <i>Leo</i> is, you see, in his Prologue to this
Donation, very peremptory that it is authentick, so he triumphs in his
Epilogue to it, as if its being so were made indubitable by him,
saying," ... '<i>Wherefore Truth being supported by these and many more
such Testimonies, does not blush, but impudent Vanity is
confounded.'&nbsp; "</i>If this Pope had any Shame in him, he would
never have ventured on this Occasion to have spoke either of Blushing
or of Impudence; or if he had had any Religion, would he have dared to
have made such a Grimace as this."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For as if he himself believed all that he saith
here so positively, and with so great an Air of Religion, concerning
these Donations being indubitably authentick, he was certainly the
simplest and most credulous Man that ever put Pen to Paper: So if he
did not believe it himself, as it is more than probable he did not, he
was a most profane and vile Hypocrite to cant about it, as he does.
However, what this Pope saith here so dogmatically of the Instrument of
    <i>Constantine's</i> Donation, and its being authentick, ought to
be remembered." (pgs. 19, 20)</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <big> </big>

was in response to a letter sent by Leo, Metropolitan of Achrida to
John, Bishop of Tranum (Bulgaria), that categorically attacked the
customs of the Latin Church that differed from those of the Greeks.
Especially criticized were the Roman traditions of fasting on the
Saturday Sabbath and consecration of unleavened bread. Leo IX</font> in
his letter accused Constantinople of historically being the source of
heresy and claimed in emphatic terms the primacy of the Bishop of Rome
over even the Patriarch of Constantinople*, who would have none of it.
After Leo's assertion of primacy was summarily rejected, Patriarch
Cærularius was excommunicated by papal legates who entered
Constantinople's St. Sophia during the liturgy on July 16, 1054, and
publicly threw down the Bull that anathematized Cerularius on the altar
table. By that dramatic act, the Church was split in two in the Great
Schism that has ever since divided East and West.</big></p>

Pope <a name="Innocent_III">Innocent III</a> — (1198-1216) — <em>Inter

  <p> Pope Innocent III popularized the title "Vicar of Jesus Christ".
In <i>Inter corporalia</i>, he claimed that as the Vicar of Jesus
Christ, only the Roman Pontiff could remove or transfer bishops,
because he acted not with human, but with divine power and authority
reserved for the Roman Pontiff alone:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Non enim humana sed potius divina potestate conjugium
spirituale dissolvitur, cum per translationem, vel depositionem
auctoritate Romani Pontificis (quem constat esse vicarium Jesu
Christi), episcopus ab ecclesia removetur: et ideo tria haec, quae

    <p> For it is not by human but rather divine power that spiritual
marriage is dissolved, when as by translation or cession by the
authority of the Bishop of Rome (Whom it is known to be the Vicar of
Jesus Christ) a Bishop is removed from his Church: These three are
reserved to the Roman Pontiff alone—not so much by Canonical
institution as by Divine institution.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In <i>Licet in tantum</i>, Pope Innocent III stated that he was
the successor of Peter and Vicar of Jesus Christ:</p>
  <p> Sicut legitimi matrimonii vinculum, quod est virum est et uxorem,
homo dissolvere nequit, Domino dicente in Evangelio, <i>Quod Deus
conjunxit, homo non separet (Matth. </i>xix,6) : sic et spirituale
foedus conjugii, quod est inter episcopum et Ecciesiam, quod in

  <p> For instance, man can not overthrow the bond of a legitimate
marriageof husband and wife, the Lord saying in the Gospel, That which
God hath joined together, let not man put asunder (Matt. xix, 6): so
also is the spiritual covenant of marriage, which is between the bishop
and the church, which begins in the election, is ratified in

bequeathed to the Pope when Constantine vacated Rome for
Constantinople, leaving the Bishop of Rome to fill the vacuum. This is
mentioned in both the Donation and in the book of Revelation: </p>

  </ul>
  <p>Dr. Johannes Quasten (1900-1987), a renowned Catholic patristics
scholar, considered perhaps the greatest authority in this field, when
questioned in 1943 about Vicarius Filii Dei, freely admitted in writing
that "The title <u>Vicarius Filii Dei</u> as well as the title <u>Vicarius
Christi</u> is very common as the title for the Pope." So, it is
reasonable to assume that Dr. Quasten was indeed aware of the title
appearing in <i>Summa,</i> and in Leo IX's letter, thus his concession
that it is very common. See <i><b><a
 href="vicarius-filii-dei-documentation.html">The
Search to Document and Authenticate Vicarius Filii Dei</a>.</b></i></p>
  <p>These extraordinary and blasphemous claims in <i>Summa</i>
deserve special attention:</p>
  <p>Question 6 Ad 1: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secunda ratio accipitur ex parte Papae. solus
Papa dicitur esse Vicarius Dei: quia solum quod ligatur vel solvitur
per eum, habetur solutum et ligatum per ipsum Deum. Sententia igitur
Papae et sententia Dei vna sententia est: sicut una sententia est
Papae, et auditoris eius. Cum igitur appellatio semper fiat a minori
iudice ad superiorem, sicut nullus est major seipso: ita nulla
appellatio tenet, facta a Papa ad Deum: quia unum consistorium est
ipsius Papae et ipsius Dei: cuius consistorij clauiger et ostiarius est
ipse Papa. Nullus ergo potest appellare a Papa ad Deum. Nullus ergo
potest appellare a Papa ad Deum, sicut nulla potest intrare ad
consistorium Dei, nisi mediante Papa, qui est aeternae vitae c<font
 face="Times New Roman">ó</font>nsistorij clauiger, et ostiarius et
sicut nullus pot appellare ad se ipsum: ita nullas p<font
 face="Times New Roman">ó</font>t appellare <font
 face="Times New Roman">à</font> Papa ad Deu. quia vna sententia est,
et vna curia Dei, et Pape.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second reason considering the role of the
Pope. Only the Pope is said to be the Vicar of God: because he alone is
able to bind and loose, possessing alone loosing and binding given to
him by God. The decision of the Pope and the decision of God constitute
one decision, just as the decision of the Pope and his disciple are the
same. Since, therefore, an appeal is always taken from an inferior
judge to a superior, as no one is greater than himself, so no appeal
holds when made from the Pope to God, because there is one consistory
of the Pope himself and of God Himself, of which consistory the Pope
himself is the key-bearer and the doorkeeper. Therefore no one can
appeal from the Pope to God, as no one can enter into the consistory of
God without the mediation of the Pope, who is the key-bearer and the
doorkeeper of the consistory of eternal life; and as no one can appeal
to himself, so no one can appeal from the Pope to God, because there is
one decision and one court of God, and the Pope.</p>

  <p>Question 9: De Exhibitione Honoris Papae. (pg. 71, 1582 edition.)<br>
Displaying honor to the Pope.</p>
  <p>Articulus 1: <br>
Utrum honor, qui debetur Christo secundum quod Deus, debeatur Papae.<br>
Whether the honor due Christ as God is due the Pope.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ad Primum sic proceditur. Videtur enim, quod honor, qui debetur
Christo secundum, quod Deus debeatur Papae. Quia honor debetur
potestati: sed una est potestas Christi secundum quod Deus, et Papae.
quod probatur.</p>
    <p>So proceeding on the first point. It is to be seen as fact that
the honor that is due Christ as God is due also to the Pope: because
the honor is due the power, and the power of Christ as God and the
[power of the] Pope are one, which is shown to be true.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p> Satan's policy in this final conflict with God's people is the
same that he employed in the opening of the great controversy in
heaven. He professed to be seeking to promote the stability of the
divine government, while secretly bending every effort to secure its
overthrow. And the very work which he was thus endeavoring to
accomplish he charged upon the loyal angels. The same policy of
deception has marked the history of the Roman Church. <u>It has
professed to act as the vicegerent of Heaven, while seeking to exalt
itself above God and to change His law.</u> (<i>Great Controversy</i>,
591)</p>

These 6 points regarding papal ability to grant dispensation, are
proposing that Pope's innately possess the authority to overrule the
Sabbath commandment of God as written in the Bible, and so are able to
change it in any aspect, however they should decree.<br>
  <br>
Nunc considerandum est de dispesatione tertij praecepti.<br>
Now we must consider dispensation of the third commandment.<br>
  <br>
Circa quod queruntur sex.<br>
In regard to six arguments.<br>
  <br>
Primo, Utrum Papa possit dispensare, quòd dies Sabbati servetur
secundum sensum spiritualem, non litteralem.<br>
First, whether the pope can grant dispensation, that the Sabbath day
should be observed in a spiritual sense, not literal [according to the
Bible].<br>
  <br>
Secundo, Utrum Papa possit dispensare, quòd dies Sabbati in diem
Dominicam sit mutata.<br>
Secondly, whether the pope can grant dispensation, changing the sabbath
day to the Lord 's day.<br>
  <br>
Tertio, Utrum Papa possit dispensare, quòd dies Dominica fiant servilia
opera.<br>
Third, whether the Pope can grant dispensation, permitting servile work
on the Lord's day.<br>
  <br>
Quarto, Utrum Papa debeat prohibere strictius opera servilia fieri in
die Dominica, quàm fuerint prohibita in die Sabbati.<br>
Fourth, whether the Pope may strictly prohibit servile work on the
Lord's day, as it was prohibited on the Sabbath.<br>
  <br>
Quinto, Utrum Papa possit dispensare, quòd in dies Dominica fiat forum
rerum emptionis, &amp; venditionis.<br>
Fifth, whether the Pope can grant dispensation, permitting market
buying and selling on the Lord's day.<br>
  <br>
Sexto, Utrum Papa possit dispensare, quòd in dies Dominica committatur
bellum.<br>
Sixth, whether the Pope can grant dispensation, so that war may be
waged on the Lord's day.
  <p align="center"> <img src="Question50-2.gif"

significatorum preeminentiam, factorum excellentiam, temporumque

day, due to the preeminence of things signified, and the excellent
factors in agreement with time and circumstance.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <b><font size="4">So, the same

    <p class="P3">Triumphus, an Italian, born in Ancona, 1243, made
archbishop of Nazareth and died at Naples, 1328, was a zealous advocate
of Boniface VIII. His leading treatise, The Power of the Church,—<i>Summa

decision on the question of evangelical poverty and for his opposition
to the emperor’s dominion in Italy.<sup><a

that certain wicked men dwelling in Basel have plotted in these days so
as to breach the unity of holy church, and since we fear that they may
seduce some of the unwary by their deceits and inject them with their
poisons, are forced to proclaim in like words to the people of our lord
Jesus Christ entrusted to us, depart from the tents of these wicked
men, particularly since the Christian people is far more numerous than
the Jewish people of those days, the church is holier than the
synagogue, and the vicar of Christ is superior in authority and status

supremecy and infallibilty, and strongly opposed the conciliarists.
Thomas Torquemada, the Grand Inquisitor, was his nephew.&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the second objection concerning the donation of
Constantine, it is answered by a minor denial. The Roman pontiff does
not have his primacy by Constantine, but by Christ to blessed Peter and
Peter's successors, as said in John: Feed my sheep. (John 21:16-17) And
for proof concerning c. Constantine dist - 96. the answer is that in
the entire c. can not conclude that by Constantine the Roman pontiff
had primacy, Constantine says that blessed Peter and his successor the
Roman Pontiff inherited this primacy from Christ, to whom he said, Thus
and so. The blessed Peter is said to be appointed as the <font
 color="red">Vicar of the Son of God</font> on earth, &amp;c. hence, he
[Constantine] did not give the privilege of primacy to the Roman
pontiff, but he believed it a command from Christ, to be observed and
honored by all the churches of the world, thus showing that he
[Constantine] is not the author of [papal] primacy, but rather the
executor of the law as Christ ordained, as has been said above in

    <p>And as much as to the first, since the pope is vicar of the Son
of God, as that God made the creatures as if by means of the mediation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But behold this present [name] (Vicarius Filii Dei)
in every way is such as is required. For first, it is a Latin name, and
most exactly renders with significant letters that Apocalyptic number;
then it harmonizes wholly and always with the papal order in itself
(even though by hypothesis [ex hypothesi]), as no pontiff denies; then
it is not offensive or vile as imposed upon him by adversaries, but is
especially honorable to this very one, venerable, and formidable to
others: which all the pontiffs have now already ascribed to themselves
for more than 600 years (as is apparent), and do ascribe today, and
wish to be ascribed: on which account they vehemently glory and boast
with an execrable voice that they hold, shared as it were with the
omnipotent God, the rule throughout the earth in human affairs. This
[is] what, among other things (for who may investigate all the swelling
words of papal bulls?), that decretal of Pope Aeneas Sylvius (who
wished later to be called Pius) makes clearly evident—[that decretal]
published in the year 1459 at Mantua which John Sleidan notes in his
historical commentaries, vol. 2—in which he [the pope] took care that
nobody should appeal from the pope to a Council because he said that,
in the nature of things, nothing greater could be found above the Vicar
of Christ." <font face="Times New

transfer of power from the emperor to the papacy. On February 23, 1520,
about four years before the Raphael's painting of the Donation was
completed, Martin Luther, in a letter to Spalatin, wrote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left;">I have at hand Lorenzo Valla's proof
that the Donation of Constantine is a forgery. Good heavens, what
darkness and wickedness is at Rome. You wonder at the judgment of God
that such unauthentic, crass, imprudent lies not only lived, but
prevailed for so many centuries, that they were incorporated in the
canon law ... and became as articles of faith. I am in such a passion
that I scarcely doubt that the pope is the Antichrist expected by the
world, so closely do their acts, lives, sayings, and laws agree.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p style="text-align: left;">9. ... All these excessive,
over-presumptuous, and most wicked claims of the Pope are the invention
of the devil, with the object of bringing in antichrist in due course
and of raising the Pope above God, as indeed many have done and are now
doing. It is not meet that the Pope should exalt himself above temporal
authority, except in spiritual matters, such as preaching and
absolution; in other matters he should be subject to it, according to
the teaching of St. Paul (Rom. xiii.) and St. Peter (I Peter iii.), as
I have said above. He is not the vicar of Christ in heaven, but only of
Christ upon earth. For Christ in heaven, in the form of a ruler,
requires no vicar, but there sits, sees, does, knows, and commands all
things. But He requires him "in the form of a servant" to represent Him
as He walked upon earth, working, preaching, suffering, and dying. But
they reverse this: they take from Christ His power as a heavenly Ruler,
and give it to the Pope, and allow "the form of a servant" to be
entirely forgotten (Phil. ii. 7). He should properly be called the
counter-Christ, whom the Scriptures call antichrist; for his whole
existence, work, and proceedings are directed against Christ, to ruin
and destroy the existence and will of Christ.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">It is also absurd and puerile for the
Pope to boast for such blind, foolish reasons, in his decretal
Pastoralis, that he is the rightful heir to the empire, if the throne
be vacant. Who gave it to him? Did Christ do so when He said, "The
kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, but ye shall not do
so" (Luke xxii. 25, 26)? Did St. Peter bequeath it to him? It disgusts
me that we have to read and teach such impudent, clumsy, foolish lies
in the canon law, and, moreover, to take them for Christian doctrine,
while in reality they are mere devilish lies. Of this kind also is the
unheard-of lie touching the "donation of Constantine." It must have
been a plague sent by God that induced so many wise people to accept
such lies, though they are so gross and clumsy that one would think a
drunken boor could lie more skillfully. How could preaching, prayer,
study, and the care of the poor consist with the government of the
empire? These are the true offices of the Pope, which Christ imposed
with such insistence that He forbade them to take either coat or scrip
(Matt. x. 10), for he that has to govern a single house can hardly
perform these duties. Yet the Pope wishes to rule an empire and to
remain a pope. This is the invention of the knaves that would fain
become lords of the world in the Pope's name, and set up again the old
Roman empire, as it was formerly, by means of the Pope and name of
Christ, in its former condition. </p>

  <p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">O John, O John, Vicar
of my well-beloved Son, I shall snatch thee, as it were, from thy foe.
Thee who art Pope, I make my Vicar for the solemn gift which I sought
from My Son and have obtained by my prayers. So, it behooveth thee to
grant a favor and confirmation to my holy and devout Order of Carmel,
which took its rise with Elias and Eliseus on the mountain of that
name. Whoso maketh profession, whoso observeth the Rule drawn up by my
servant Albert the Patriarch, whoso unfailing shows obedience thereunto
and to that which has been approved by my dear son Innocent, so that
thou mayest accept through the true Vicars of My Son on earth what My
Son hath ordained in Heaven: that he who shall have persevered in holy
obedience, poverty and chastity, or shall enter the Holy Order, shall
be saved.<br>

commissioned its construction, the Salone Sistino (or <a
 href="http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/?f">Apostolic
Library</a>) is on the top floor of the building that s the north end
of the Cortile del Belvedere from east to west, connecting the
Belvedere and the Vatican Palace. Richly decorated by Giovani Guerra,
Cesare Nebbia, and assistants, there are several frescoes of note. On
the east end of the grand hall, there is a <a
 href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_THE_COUNCIL_OF_NICEA_Fresco_in_the_Sistine_Salon_Vatican.html">fresco
of the First Nicean Council</a> of 325 A.D. Beneath the fresco is the
inscription:</p>

reads:</p>
<p align="center">SANCTVS SILVESTRO PAPA FLAVIO CONSTANTINO MAGNO
IMPERATORE CHRISTVS DEI FILIUS PATRI</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The inscription states that Pope
Silvester I and Emperor Flavius Constantine declare Christ the Son and
God the Father consubstantial, condemning the Arian heresy. In the
fresco, Bishop Hosius of Cordoba is presiding and is seated at top
center. He is flanked by Pope Sylvester's legates, Victor and
Vincentius. The crowned emperor Constantine, who convened the council,
is seated in the left center foreground, and Christ and God the Father
are seated in a cloud at top left.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <a
 href="Sources/Temporal-140-141.gif">[pg. 140]</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">... there are Catholics who talk
against the temporal power of the Pope, either because they have been
stunned by the clamours of a Protestant people, or because they are
white-hearted, and have not courage to stand in the face of popular
falsehood for an unpopular truth. The spirit of Protestant England<font
 face="Times New Roman">?</font>its lawlessness, its pride, its
contempt, and its enmity to the Church of God<font
 face="Times New Roman">?</font>has made Catholics too to be
cold-hearted, even when the Vicar of Jesus Christ is insulted. We have
need, then, to be upon our guard. It shall happen once more with some,
as it did when the Son of God was in His Passion<font
 face="Times New Roman">?</font>they saw Him betrayed, bound, carried
away, buffeted, blindfolded, and scourged; they saw Him carry His Cross
to Calvary, then nailed upon it, and lifted up to the scorn of the
world; and they said, "If he be the king of Israel, let him now come
down from the cross, and we will believe him."* So in like manner they
say now, "See this Catholic Church, this Church of God, feeble and
weak, rejected even by the very nations called Catholic. There is
Catholic France, and Catholic Germany, and Catholic Italy, giving up
this exploded figment of the temporal power of the Vicar of Jesus
Christ." And </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <a
 href="Sources/Temporal-140-141.gif">[pg. 141]</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">so, because the Church seems weak, and
the <b>Vicar of the Son of God</b> is renewing the Passion of his
Master upon earth, therefore we are scandalized, therefore we turn our
faces from him. Where, then, is our faith? But the Son of God foretold
these things when He said, "And now I have told you, before it come to
pass; that when it shall come to pass, you may believe."*</p>
  <p align="center">* St. John xiv. 29.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <a
 href="Sources/Temporal-230-231.gif">[pg. 230]</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">... Lastly, the only other point upon
which I shall speak to is this. We have already seen how the powers and
glories of the Holy See have been progressively unfolding; how the time
of St. Gregory I. was a period of apostolic missions, converting the
nations to the faith; how the time of St. Leo III. was a period</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <a
 href="Sources/Temporal-230-231.gif">[pg. 231]</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">of creating the Christian world; how
the time of St. Gregory VII. was a period of purifying the sanctuary of
the Church; and how the time of Alexander III. was a period of royalty
of government and of ecclesiastical order, when the divine power of the
church directed, by a firm and sacred authority, the civil powers of
the world within the sphere of the law of God and of obedience to the
faith. Now I observe these powers of the Holy See have been always
rising, always culminating. The temporal power in the hand of St.
Gregory I. was a fatherly and patriarchal rule over nations not as yet
reduced to civil order. In the hands of St. Leo III. it became a power
of building empires. In the hands of St. Gregory VII. it was a scourge
to chasten them. In the hands of Alexander III. it was a dynasty,
ruling supremely, in the name of God, over the powers of the world. And
now in these later times the temporal sovereignty has become a law of
the conscience, an axiom of the reason. Through long contests and
denials it has passed into consciences, intellects, and hearts of men.
Like the great dogmas of the Church, through controversy it has reached
its analysis and expression. It stands by the side of the Immaculate
Conception a theological certainty, if not a definition. So that I may
say there never was a time when the temporal power of the <strong>Vicar
of the Son of God</strong>, though assailed as we see it, was more
firmly rooted through-</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"> <a
 href="Sources/Temporal-232.gif">[pg. 232]</a></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">out the whole unity of the Catholic
Church in the hearts and convictions of its members; and that by a
double process, not only by its own proper evidence, not only by the
light of God's dealing with the world, but by contrast. For the nations
of Europe have already seen that the society of the world, without the
guidance and preservation of the Church of God, resolves itself into
confusion. They have seen every form of political society, and the
confederations of kingdoms and nations, dissolve and pass away. While
all the floating societies of the world have drifted down the stream,
the centre of obedience has become more stable. Men have learned from
the history of modern Europe that the law which is called the law of
nations—that is, the rule of justice which regulates the relations of
people with people—has become weak and powerless. And why? Because the
nations have broken the bonds which bound them to the centre of
obedience, and have shaken off the noble submission to a tribunal
higher than man, from which came forth, in other days, the judgments of
equity and of justice. It was a dignified obedience to bow to the <strong>Vicar
of the Son of God</strong>, and to remit the arbitration of their
griefs to one whom all wills consented to obey.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In the many hundreds of years that the
Donation of Constantine appeared in Catholic Canon Law, it was
apparently always presented as a genuine historical document legally
granting the papacy temporal power and authority, for to acknowledge it
as a fraud would have been to admit that power and authority of the
papacy to be likewise fraudulent. With the forced loss of the papal
states from 1798 to 1870, the territorial sovereignty that the papacy
had acquired via the donation was gone, until 1929, when Mussolini in
the Lateran Pact granted it sovereignty over the Vatican City State.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Again in the April 18th, 1915 edition of <em>Our
Sunday Visitor, </em>Rev. John F. Noll, editor, the following question
was addressed on page 3, in the section titled Bureau of Information:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>What are the letters supposed to be
in the Pope's crown, and what do they signify, if anything?</i></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">The letters inscribed in the Pope's
mitre are these: <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>, which is the Latin for the
Vicar of the Son of God. Catholics hold that the church which is a
visible society must have a visible head. Christ, before His ascension
into heaven, appointed St. Peter to act as His representative. Upon the
death of Peter the man who succeeded to the office of Peter as Bishop
of Rome, was recognized as the head of the Church. Hence to the Bishop
of Rome, as head of the Church, was given the title "Vicar of Christ."</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Enemies of the Papacy denounce this
title as a malicious assumption. But the Bible informs us that Christ
did not only give His Church authority to teach, but also to rule.
Laying claim to the authority to rule in Christ's spiritual kingdom, in
Christ's stead, is not a whit more malicious than laying claim to the
authority to teach in Christ's name. And this every Christian minister
does.</p>

<p><a name="1917" style="margin-left: 40px;"></a><i>Our Sunday Visitor</i>
had the following denial in the Bureau of Information section of the
September 16, 1917 edition:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>What application has the number 666
to Pope Benedict XV?<br>
&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman">—</font></i>None whatever. Such an
interpretation of Chapter XIII, Verse 18 of the Apocalypse is entirely
unfounded and is nothing more than a display of malignant hatred. It is
the effervescense of vacuous minds. Earlier commentators spent
considerable time in trying to determine the personality of the beast,
and they referred it to Nero Caesar; for by supplying the numerals for
the Hebrew characters in his name, the number 666 was obtained. During
the period of the Reformation and for years after, the Apocalypse
furnished the basis of much political and religious incrimination. In
later years, really reliable commentators have ceased the silly prattle
about the Popes, Napoleon, Rome and subjecting the Book to the Rules of
exegesis see a reference to conditions existing at the time of St.
John. (This interpretation, of course, does not include the
Resurrection, the millennium, and the plagues preceding the
consummation of the world, as referring to principle events in the
first century). In a "Dictionary of the Bible" edited by William
Schmidt, a Protestant author, page 1038, will be found the following;
"Ebrard reckons that not less than eighty systematic commentaries are
worthy of note, and states the less valuable writings on this
inexhaustible subject are unnumbered if not innumerable. Fanaticism,
theological hatred, and vain curiosity may have largely influenced
their composition." Also on page 1039 we find the following: "Against
the Historical scheme it is urged, that its advocates differ very
widely among themselves; that they assume without any authority that
the 1260 days are so many years; that several of its applications<font
 face="Times New
            Roman">—</font>e.g., of the symbol of the
ten-horned beast to be the Popes, and the sixth seal to the conversion
of Constantine<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>are inconsistent
with the context; that attempts by some of this school to predict
future events by the help of Revelation have ended in repeated
failures."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, if present-day writers are so anxious to see the
fulfillment in the person of the Pope, why not be consistent? Such
interpreters have never shown that the title "Vicarius Filii Dei" is
really inscribed upon the Pope's tiara. Moreover, the passage states
that the number refers to a man, in other words the numerals
represented by the letters in his name, which total the sum 666. The
words Vicarius Filii Dei are not the name of the Pope, they do not even
constitute his official title. The name of our President is Woodrow
Wilson. His title is President of the United States. If we take the
name Benedict XV and follow out the same numerical addition, we find
that his number instead of being 666 would be 1123.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This question was submitted to Rev. Earnest R. Hull and
answered in the following manner: "Almost every eminent man in
Christendom, who has enjoyed the privilege of possessing enemies, has
had his name turned and twisted till they could get the number 666 out
of it. In past history there have been numberless beasts or
Anti-Christs, all of whose names counted up to 666. I fancy that <i>my
own name</i>, especially in Latin form, might give the number of the
beast:</p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">The following challenge
to Adventists appeared on page 5:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;Lufkin, Texas</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;Most Rev. Bishop
Noll: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think your readers will be interested in the
following letter, which was written in the interest of truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">Editors, "Present
Truth". <br>
Washington, D. C.:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have just paid a visit to the Angelina County Jail here in Lufkin,
Texas, where, through the courtesy of the Judge and the Sheriff, an
opportunity was given to interview Glenn M. Warren (incarcerated on the
charge of murder) whom you have won to your anti-Catholic belief. There
he sits, poor fellow, using part of his dreary time and artistic
talents in drawing, according to your directions, a picture of the
tiara of the Pope with the words inscribed upon it "Vicarius Filii Dei"
(Vicar of the Son of God) which he has figured out, as Seventh Day
Adventism directs, to total the numerical value 666. This is intended
to prove that the Pope is the beast, the anti-Christ in the 13th.
Chapter of the Book of Revelation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your publications have so completely captured the
mind of Glenn M. Warren (as it has others) that he, unfortunate young
man, does not sense the falsity nor the viciousness of your contention.
He knows only that were the anti-Christ to enter the Angelina County
Jail he would be more easily recognized by his work of turning minds
against the Catholic Church than by the numerical value of the name he
fears. He would not be seen, as is the representative of the pope, the
priest, going around from cell to cell directing the minds of prisners
to Christ, to the Church of Christ, and to the sacraments Christ
instituted to reconcile sinners with God. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hereby enter a protest against the
distribution of your misrepresentation among prisoners or sinners. It
is an offense against Christian charity, which does not permit the
intensification of religious animosity. You can see the evil result of
it upon the sinner who is very likely to be sent to the electric chair.
It turned his mind against Catholic Christians instead of towards
Christ and Him crucified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If "Present Truth" is published, as you say,
to tell the truth, then would its editors and publishers refrain from
filling its pages with a mass of oft-refuted statements against the
Church that owes its origin to Jesus Christ, the Church to which
Catholics have paid honor to their Lord and their God for 1900 years.
Obedience to the law of charity calls upon you to cease embittering
hearts and minds with the monstrous notion that the pope is the 666 in
the book of Revelation. If it were a crime as well as a sin, you may be
assured that you and your associated Seventh Day Adventists would be
under lock and key for murdering truth. You are not just guilty of
misrepresenting the Catholic, but you are also guilty of abusing the
use of public places by your wanton disregard of the courtesy due to
citizens and taxpayers who are Catholics. This you have done here in
Lufkin, as elsewhere, by placing racks in the Court House, railway
station and hotels that are filled with your insulting effusions. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before going into a detailed reply to your
charge it were well to let you know that this is not the first time
that I have contacted your evil work. I have met it in all parts of the
United States during the 70,000 mile lecture journey of the Catholic
Campaigners For Christ. Heretofore I have contented myself with the
reply that appears in my Campaigners For Christ Handbook, and by
answering your Seventh Day Adventist clientele whenever they were
brazen enough to present their offensive reference to the pope at
outdoor meetings. It is the vicious work of drawing a man indicted for
murder into the maelstrom of Seventh Day Adventist misrepresentation
that promps me to write directly to headquarters in Tacoma Park to find
out whether the time has come when a dispassionate, detailed refutation
of the charge will turn you from furthering the assault for which God
will surely punish its perpetrators if they do not repent and make
reparation for their offense. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place Protestant authorities of repute
today are not, as you claim, "in practical agreement" that the
beast—the anti-Christ—is the papal authority. To quote two in one book:
"Word Studies In The New Testament", by Marvin R. Vincent, D. D.
Baldwin Professor of Sacred Literature in Union Theological Seminary,
New York, 1905 (vol. II)—says rightly: "The interpretations of the
number form a jungle from which escape is apparently hopeless. Reuss
says: 'This famous number has been made to yield almost all the
historical names of the past eighteen centuries: Titus, Vespasian,
Simon Groras; Julian the Apostate and Genseric; Mahomet and Luther;
Benedict IX and Louis XV; Napoleon I., and the Duke of Ruchstadt; and
it would not he diffcult, on the same principles, to read in any one's
name'."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The correctness of this fact was demonstrated by the
able Jesuit Father Hull of Bombay who Latinized his name—(Ernestus
Reginalus Hull) to show the Seventh Day Adventists of India that
according to their system of reckoning, he himself and not the pope is
the anti-Christ in the Book of Revelation, for his name totals 666.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the second place Protestant authorities of high
standing are agreed that the name referred to in the 13th. Chapter of
the Book of Revelation is that of a man and not the title of a man. I
name the Unabridged Edition of Cruden's Concordance (page 411) as one
of many authorities that sustain this contention. The name of the
occupant of the Chair of Peter is Pope Pius XI, and not Vicarius Filii
Dei, and it does not total 666 in any language. But more than all,
there is no such inscription on the Pope's tiara.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vicarius Filii Dei is not the pope's title,
though he is the vicar of Jesus Christ Who is the Son of God. His
title, as can be found in Volume XV of the Catholic Encyclopedia, is
(in Latin) Vicarius Christ and that totals (V 5-i I-c 100-i I u 5-c
100-i I I) 214 and not 666. The Catholic Encyclopedia says that at
times the pope has been called Vicar of St. Peter, Vicar of the
Apostolic See. But neither in the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Catholic
Directory, nor in papal documents, is the pope titled Vicarius Filii
Dei. Besides what warrant is there for assuming the name of the man
referred to in the Book of Revelation is to appear in Latin? St. John
wrote the Book in Greek and Vicar or Vicegerent of the Son of God in
Greek does not total numerically 666 according to your ingenious system
of reckoning. Evidently, you failed to examine, or thought your readers
too undiscerning to note, that the quotation from "Labbe and Cossart's
History" in "Present Truth" (Page 3, Vol. 3, No. 20) rightly designates
the pope as vicar of Christ, and not vicar of the Son of God. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fourth place if you will not go to Catholic
authorities, as every just person should, to learn the title of the
pope, then you might go to our leading dictionaries for the
information. Ah no! Seventh Day Adventists find it more in harmony with
their monstrous claim to draw upon their imagination or to go to some
anti-Catholic source for their material. Webster's New International
Dictionary says that "vicar of (Jesus) Christ—the pope; is a title
assumed with reference to his claim to represent Christ as head of the
church on earth". Please note that Webster says "head of the church ON
EARTH" for "the papacy"' does not (as you insist in "Present Truth")
"set up a man as head of the church in place of Christ, offering him
divine worship and addressing him in terms and titles which belong only
to the Son of God". Every one of the three hundred and more millions of
Catholics in the world knows that such a thing would be a violation of
the Law of God. The pope is, as Webster says,"head of the church on
earth", for Christ Jesus is held by Catholics to be the Supreme Head,
the heavenly Head of His Universal Church which He promised to be with
until the end of the world. Webster's Dictionary says that a
vicegerent, a vicar is a representative, one "having or exercising
delegated power; acting by substitution, or in place of one delegating
hi. power."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My hope is that "Present Truth" will cease bearing
false witness against Catholics by printing real truth. My hope is that
its editors and associated preachers will call a halt to nailing Truth
to the Cross as did Pilate, the Jews, and the Roman soldiers, through
the circulation of error, slander and incentive to uncharitableness. I
await your answer to this challenge.</p>

What Does Vicarius Filii Dei Mean?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Q. </strong>Vicarius Filii
Dei? What does this mean? Is it a phrase referring to the pope or
priest? I have heard that it is inscribed on the pope’s hat, or
something. Just curious to know what is it.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>— Lloyd Howell</strong></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>A</strong>. Here’s a reply from
Father Reginald Martin:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> means
“Vicar [or representative] of the Son of God,” a term scholars believe
first appears in a document known as the “Donation of Constantine,”
dated to the eight or ninth century. This is an apt description of the
Pope, who is frequently referred to as “the Vicar of Christ,” and, at
present, probably only the most bitterly anti-Catholic individuals
would take offense at the title.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, this has not always been the
case. Foes of Catholicism from the 16th to the 19th centuries delighted
in pointing out that the title could be turned into the “666” that is
the “mark of the beast” in the Book of Revelation. (Those who have
enjoyed Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” may smile as they remember that
Napoleon’s name and title can be similarly manipulated).</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">An early reader asked Our Sunday
Visitor about the title, and the newspaper replied (April 18, 1915)
that it was inscribed on the papal tiara. A short time later, the
journal printed a correction, which was repeated in a 1922 article.
Scholars have examined the existing papal regalia (this amounts to
quite a collection) and have found no evidence that any papal crown
carries the title. </p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Papal Miter</h3>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Q. </strong>Why would the pope
have inscribed on his miter <em>vicarius filii dei,</em> which is not
an official title for the pope, instead of <em>vicarius Christi</em>,
which is an official title? </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Ben Bohman</strong>,
Auburndale, Wis.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>A.</strong> The pope can do
whatever he wants as long as he is faithful to Christ. The Code of
Canon Law states, “No appeal or recourse is permitted against a
sentence or decree of the Roman Pontiff” (Canon 333.3). So, the Holy
Father himself can determine what is an official title, because he is
the official.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">All the same, there is really no
difference between the term vicarius filii dei and vicarius Christi.
The first means “Vicar of the Son of God,” and the second is translated
“Vicar of Christ.” As the Son of God is Christ, the two mean the same
thing.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
most plausible name we have ever seen suggested as containing the
number of the beast, is the blasphemous title which the pope applies to
himself, and wears in jeweled letters upon his miter or pontifical
crown. That title is this: Vicarious filii Dei: "Vicegerent of the Son
of God." Taking the letters out of this title which the Latins use as
numerals, and giving them their numerical value, we have just 666. Thus
we have V, 5; I, 1; C, 100; (a and r not used as numerals;) I, 1; U
(formerly the same as V) 5; (s and f not used as numerals;) I, 1; L,
50; I, 1; I, 1; D, 500; (e not used as a numeral;) I, 1. Adding these
numbers together, we have just 666.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following extract on this point is from a work
entitled "The Reformation,"[*] bearing the date of 1832:<font
 face="Times New Roman">?<br>
  </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. A., said Miss. Emmons, I saw a very
curious fact the other day; I have dwelt upon it much and will mention
it. A person, lately, was witnessing a ceremony of the Romish church.
As [pg. 226] the Pope passed him in the procession, splendidly dressed
in his pontifical robes, the gentleman's eye rested on these full,
blazing, letters in front of his miter: "VICARIOUS FILII DEI," The
Vicar of the Son of God." His thoughts, with the rapidity of lightning,
reverted to Rev. xiii, 18. Will you turn to it? said Mrs. A. Alice
opened the New Testament and read:<i> '</i>Let him that hath
understanding count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a
man; and his number is six hundred three score and six.'<i> </i>She
paused, and Miss. Emmons said, He took out his pencil, and, marking the
numerical letters of the inscription on his tablet, it stood 666."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we have indeed the number of a man, even the
"man of sin;" and it is a little singular, perhaps providential, that
he should select a title which shows the blasphemous character of the
beast, and then cause it to be inscribed upon his miter, as if to brand
himself with the number 666.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="justify">Note that Anne Bullard,
on page 247, presents the title with the word VICARIVS, the old Latin
spelling that uses a "V" for a "U". This is likely to be the form of
the word used if it appeared on a papal tiara or mitre. Uriah Smith on
the other hand, misquotes Bullard, using the unlikely English spelling,
VICARIOUS, which has "OU". Smith in his later publications changes this
to the more modern Latin, VICARIUS, using only a "U", as shown below,
which also may be the way it was inscribed with jewels on the papal
mitre or tiara.</p>
<hr style="margin-left: 40px;" color="#000000">
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">. . . The most plausible expression we have seen
suggested as containing the number of the beast, is the title which the
pope takes to himself, and allows others to apply to him. That title is
this: <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>, "Vicegerent of the Son of God."
Taking the letters out of this title which the Latins used as numerals,
and giving them their numerical value, we have just 666. Thus we have
V, 5; I, 1; C, 100; (<i>a</i> and <i>r</i> not used as numerals); I,

numeral); I, 1. Adding these numbers together, we have just 666.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This title, there is reason to believe, was formerly
inscribed upon the pope's crown. The following testimony on this point
is given by the late Elder D. E. Scoles, of Washburn, Mo.:—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have met two men who declare that they have seen
this specific crown; and their testimony is so perfectly in agreement
that I am convinced that what they saw is true. The first man was M. De
Latti, a Sabbath-keeper who had previously been a Catholic priest, and
had spent four years in Rome. He visited me when I was pastor in St.
Paul, Minn., several years ago. I showed him my tract,&nbsp; <a
 href="http://jewel.andrews.edu/record=b1736206">'The Seal of God and
the Mark of the Beast.'</a> He at once told me that the inscription was
not correctly placed in my illustration. He stated that he had often
seen it in the museum at the Vatican, and [pg. 625] gave a detailed and
accurate description of the whole crown. <img
 src="VFD-Scoles.gif" align="left" border="0"
 height="498" width="322">When my tract was published [Feb. of 1895], I
was ignorant of the arrangement of the words of the Latin inscriptions,
hence, in the illustration of the crown, placed them in one line.
Brother De Latti at once pointed out the mistake, and said the first
word of the sentence was on the first crown of the triple arrangement,
the second word on the second part of the crown, while the word <i>Dei</i>
was on the lower division of the triple crown. He also explained that
the first two words were in dark-colored jewels, while the <i>Dei</i>
was composed entirely of diamonds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "During a tent-meeting which I held in Webb City,
Mo., I presented the subject, 'The Seal of God and the Mark of the
Beast.' I used charts to illustrate it, one being a reproduction of the
crown as Brother De Latti had described it. A Presbyterian minister was
present, Rev. B. Hoffman, and when I described the crown, he spoke out
publicly and made a statement to the congregation, saying that while in
Rome studying for the priesthood, he had seen this very crown, and
noted its inscription, and that the word <i>Dei</i> was composed of
one hundred diamonds. I met him and learned his name, and visited him
at his home, and was convinced from his description that this was the
identical crown that Brother De Latti had seen, but which has been
denied by many. I then asked him for a written statement, and he gave
me the following:—<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " ' To Whom It May Concern:</i> This is to
certify that I was born in Bavaria in 1828, was educated in Munich, and
was reared a Roman Catholic. In 1844 and 1845 I was a student for the
priesthood in the Jesuit College in Rome. During the Easter service of
1845, Pope Gregory XVI wore a triple crown upon which was the
inscription, in jewels, <i>Vicarius Filii Dei.</i> We were told that
there were one hundred diamonds in the word <i>Dei;</i> the other
words were of some other kind of precious stones of a darker color.
There was one word upon each crown, and not all on the same line. I was
present at the service, and saw the crown distinctly, and noted it
carefully.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " ' In 1850 I was converted to God and to
Protestantism. Two years later I entered the Evangelical Church
ministry, but later in life I united with the Presbyterian Church, of
[pg. 626] which I am now a retired pastor, having been in the ministry
for fifty years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " ' I have made the above statement at the request
of Elder D. E. Scoles, as he states that some deny that the pope ever
wore this tiara. But I know that he did, for I saw it upon his head.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I have received what seems to be reliable
information that a photo may exist (similar to the one below) of a
papal funeral in St. Peter's Basilica near the beginning of the 20th
century, in which the tiara inscribed with Vicarius Filii Dei can be
seen. Combined with the above claims of Our Sunday Visitor, this would
indicate that it was the funeral of either Leo XIII (1878-1903), or
Pius X (1903-1914), and that previous popes probably wore the tiara in
question. If anyone can turn up any photos and make them available to
me, I will post them in this article.</p>

<p>Note the following item in a widely circulated Catholic publication
from 1938. In it the title Vicarius Filii Dei and 666 is discussed, but
the validity of Vicarius Filii Dei as a papal title is not denied:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>345.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard that he [the pope] is
Anti-Christ, and that he was described by St. John as 666, the
numerical equivalent of the Latin words of the Pope's title, Vicarius
Filii Dei.</b></p>
  <p>That interpretation is absurd, and rejected by all reputable
scholars, Catholic and non-Catholic alike. In any case, St. John wrote
in Greek, and there is no warrant whatever for the translation to the
Latin language. Moreover, whatever be the true interpretation of this
mystical number, it certainly refers to some one individual being. If
it referred to one particular Pope, it could refer to none of the
others. To which Pope will people refer it? To a past Pope? Then he is
dead and gone, and we need not worry about him. To the present Pope? He
is the very antithesis of all the conditions of the Beast as described
by St. John. However, the number does not refer to any of the Popes at
all.</p>

<p>The letter "w" is asserted to be the equivalent of a double "v" or
"u", which has a value of 5 and is therefore 10 when doubled.. However,
in Latin and Roman numerals there was no "w" with a value of 10. A
single "v" was used to represent the "w", "v" and "u" sound, The
double-u (w) apparently evolved many centuries later in other
languages, but not Roman numerals. The valid Roman numerals are:</p>

<p>So, ELLEN GOVLD WHITE does <em>not, in fact,</em> add up to 666. Be
that as it may, for the moment, lets accept the application to Ellen
White. Does this indicate that she is a likely candidate for the
Antichrist or beast described in Revelation 13? Even the Catholics that
raised this issue do not seriously consider Ellen White to be the
Antichrist that scripture warns about. She will simply not fit the many
other characteristics attributed to the Antichrist. Using this random
method of application to individuals, it is apparent that there might
be literally <em>thousands</em> of names that add up to 666,
particularly if they are manipulated and Latinized as Rev. Ernest R.
Hull demonstrated in the <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> article above.
Clearly this approach is sheer foolishness, and proves nothing, but
this deliberate attempt at obscurantism by Catholics in no way
invalidates Roman numeral gematria as the solution to 666.</p>
<p>Logically, all the other characteristics of "the Antichrist" must be
considered and successfully met <i>first</i>. Only then should solving
the mystery of 666 be attempted, after all the other biblical criteria
have been solved satisfactorily, eliminating all who do not qualify.
Then applying 666 will surely result in a unique, unambiguous, and
extraordinarily powerful validation that will prove impossible to
duplicate with any other entity. See the series of articles beginning
at <b><a href="3-Angels.html">The 3 Angel's
Messages</a></b> and also <b><a

<p><b><a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/index_en.htm"><i>Acta
Apostolicae Sedis</i> (Acts of the Apostolic See)</a></b> is the
official publication of the Holy See, and documents published in it are
considered authentic and officially promulgated. The Vatican's web site
for their Secret Archives estimates the total number of papal documents
to be <a
 href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101202103927/http://asv.vatican.va/en/dipl/1_papaldocuments.htm">above
<i>30 million</i></a>. This is a staggering number of documents, and
makes it a virtual certainty that Vicarius Filii Dei was used in other
official documents that have yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>So, since the Donation of Constantine, which was held by the Roman
Catholic Church for over 600 years to be a valid document transferring
authority from Emperor Constantine, Vicarius Filii Dei continued to
appear in Catholic publications, and official papal decrees, well into
the 20th century. This is irrefutable proof that it is <i>not</i> a
Protestant invention.</p>
<p>English translations of the above Apostolic Constitutions are not
available on the Vatican web site. However, regarding the translation
of <i>Rivi Muniensis</i>, a similar wording in Latin was used by
Cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1542-1621) that can act as a guide. Here is
one example in his <i>De Ecclesia militante</i>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As thus understood, the definition of the Church given by
Bellarmine is that usually adopted by Catholic theologians: "A body of
men united together by the profession of the same Christian Faith, and
by participation in the same sacraments, under the governance of lawful
pastors, more especially of the Roman Pontiff, the sole vicar of Christ
on earth" (Cœtus hominum ejusdem christianse fidei professione, et
eorumdem sacramentorum communione colligatus, sub regimine legitimorum
pastorum et praecipue unius Christi in Terris vicarii Romani
Pontificis.—Bellarmine, De Eccl., III, ii, 9). </p>

1908 by Robert Appleton Co., and 1913 by The Encyclopedia Press, entry

745</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in the above translation of the Latin: "unius Christi in
Terris vicarii Romani Pontificis", "vicarii" does not apply to "Romani
Pontificis" (i.e., vicar of the Roman Pontiff), but rather it applies
to the preceding "Christi" (vicar of Christ on earth). This indicates
that in the similarly worded <i>Rivi Muniensis</i>, "Vicarii" applies
to "Filii Dei" (Son of God's vicar upon the earth), not "Petrique
Successores" (vicar of Peter's successor, or vicar and successor of
Peter) as an English speaker might presume. It is also worth noting
that Cardinal Bellarmine's definition of the Christian Church excludes
those who do not consider themselves subject to the authority of the
Roman Pontiff, which is to say that Protestants are not part of the
Church.</p>

The Threshold of Hope</a></i></b>, by Pope John Paul II:<br>
First Chapter: "The Pope": A Scandal and a Mystery (bold emphasis is
mine):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[pg. 3] The leader of the Catholic Church is defined by the faith
as the <strong>Vicar of Jesus Christ</strong> (and is accepted as such
by believers). The Pope is considered the man on earth who <strong>represents
the Son of God</strong>, who "takes the place" of the Second Person of
the omnipotent God of the Trinity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>[pg. 6] Have no fear when people call me the "Vicar of Christ,"
when they say to me "Holy Father," or "Your Holiness," or use titles
similar to these, which seem even inimical [hostile] to the Gospel.
Christ himself declared: "Call no one on earth your father; you have
but one Father in heaven. Do not be called 'Master'; you have but one
master, the Messiah" (Mt 23:9-10). These expressions, nevertheless,
have evolved out of a long tradition, becoming part of common usage.
One must not be afraid of these words either.</p>
  <p>[pg. 13] The Pope is not the only one who holds this title. With
regard to the Church entrusted to him, each bishop is <i>Vicarius
Christi.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that on page three of the Pope's book, "represents the Son of
God" is synonymous with "Vicar of Jesus Christ". A vicar clearly
represents, substitutes for, or "takes the place" of another, as
stated. Consequently "represents the Son of God" can be translated in
Latin as <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>, which in Roman Numerals will add
up to 666. The title <i>Vicarius Christi</i>, translated into English,
means a substitute for Christ, i.e., Antichrist, as demonstrated above,
which is applied by the Pope to every bishop of the Catholic Church!<a

<p>The <i>Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary</i> for Revelation
13:18 states:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18. Here is wisdom.</b> Compare the phrase,
“here is the mind which hath wisdom” (ch. 17:9). The wisdom here
commended is doubtless that to which Paul refers in Eph. 1:17. Only by
divine enlightenment will men understand the mysteries of the Word of
God (see on 1 Cor. 2:14).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Understanding.</b> Or, “intelligence.” Those who
wish to know the meaning of the cryptic number may understand.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Count.</b> Or, “calculate.”&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Number of the beast.</b> It should be noted that
the beast has already been conclusively identified (see on vs. 1–10).
The number provides confirmatory evidence of this.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the early days of Christianity there has been
much discussion as to the significance of 666. One of the earliest to
write on the subject was Irenaeus (c. a.d. 130–c. 202). He identified
the beast as the Antichrist, and believed that the numerical values of
the letters of his name would add up to 666. He suggested the name <i>Teitan</i>,
a name sometimes accounted divine, as having great probability. He also
suggested, but as much less probable, the name <i>Lateinos</i>, this
being the name of the last kingdom of the four seen by Daniel. At the
same time he warned that “it is therefore more certain, and less
hazardous, to await the fulfillment of the prophecy, than to be making
surmises, and casting about for any names that may present themselves,
inasmuch as many names can be found possessing the number mentioned” (<i>Against
Heresies</i> v. 30. 3; <i>ANF</i>, vol. 1, p. 559).&nbsp; Since
Irenaeus’ day 666 has been applied to many names. The number alone
cannot identify the beast since numerous names can add up to 666.
However, inasmuch as the beast has already been identified, the number
666 must have a relationship to this power. Otherwise there would be no
valid reason for the angel giving John the information contained in v.
18, at this point in the prophetic narrative.&nbsp;An interpretation
that gained currency in the period following the Reformation was that
666 stood for <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>, meaning “vicar of the Son of
God,” one of the titles for the pope of Rome. The numerical value of
the component letters of this title totals 666 as follows: </p>

  <p>This interpretation was based on the identification of the pope as
Antichrist, the historic Reformation concept. The principal exponent of
this interpretation was Andreas Helwig (c. 1572–1643; see L. E. Froom, <i>The
Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers</i>, vol. 2, pp. 605–608). Many since
his day have adopted this interpretation. Inasmuch as this commentary
identifies the beast as the papacy, it also accepts this view as being
the beast thus far presented, though recognizing that there may be more
implied in the cryptogram than this interpretation provides.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the title <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>, the
Catholic journal <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i>, of April 18, 1915,
reported in answer to a query, “What are the letters supposed to be in
the Pope’s crown, and what do they signify, if anything?” “The letters
inscribed in the Pope’s mitre are these: <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>,
which is the Latin for Vicar of the Son of God. Catholics hold that the
Church which is a visible society must have a visible head” (p. 3). The
issue of November 15, 1914, admitted that the Latin numerals added
together total 666, but went on to declare that many other names also
yield this total. In the issue of August 3, 1941, page 7, the subject
of <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> again came up for discussion, and the
statement was made that this title is not inscribed on the pope’s
tiara. The tiara, it averred, bears no inscription whatsoever (p. 7).
The <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> distinguishes between the mitre and
the tiara by describing the tiara as a non-liturgical ornament and the
mitre as one worn for liturgical functions. Whether the inscription <i>Vicarius
Filii Dei</i> appears on the tiara or the mitre is really beside the
point. The title is admittedly applied to the pope, and that is
sufficient for the purposes of prophecy. </p>

An open email to Patrick Madrid and Karl Keating, </p>
<p>I quote both of you:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"If the person making this claim disputes these facts, ask him to
furnish an example of the alleged title, <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>,
being used officially by a pope. You won't encounter papal decrees,
conciliar statements, or other authentic, official Catholic documents
in which the pope calls himself the 'Vicar of the Son of God.' Why?
Because no such examples exist. <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> has never
been an official title of the pope." (<i>Pope Fiction</i>, by Patrick
Madrid, 1999, pg. 91.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>"<i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> never has been used as a title by any
Pope." (<i>Catholicism and Fundamentalism, </i>by Karl Keating, 1988,
pg 221.)</p>

<p>Pope Paul VI used the title twice, in 1965 and 1968, in Apostolic
Constitutions, applying the title to himself, and in plural form to all
Peter's successors. See http://biblelight.net/666.htm#OFFICIAL<br>
I invite the two of you to respond to this papal use of the title, and
I will also append your response to my web page.</p>

</blockquote>
In the above rebuttal by Stephen Haws, it is conceded that Vicarius
Filii Dei applies to Peter, but he tries to make the case that it does
not apply to Peter's successors. Was Peter the first Pope, according to
Catholics? Yes, of course he was. Then Stephen Haws has in effect
conceded that Vicarius Filii Dei is a genuine papal title.
