by Pope Gregory I (the Great, 590–604 A.D.)</strong></font></center>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
  <strong>BOOK XIII</strong>
  <p>In the Sixth Indiction, and the Thirteenth Year From His Ordination.
  <p><strong>EPISTLE I.</strong>
  <p>To the Roman Citizens. Gregory, servant of the servants of God, to his most
  beloved sons the Roman citizens.
  <p>It has come to my ears that certain men of perverse spirit have sown among
  you some things that are wrong and opposed to the holy faith, so as to forbid
  any work being done on the Sabbath day. What else can I call these but
  preachers of Antichrist, who, when he comes, will cause the Sabbath day as
  well as the Lord's day to be kept free from all work. For, because he pretends
  to die and rise again, he wishes the Lord's day to be had in reverence; and,
  because he compels the people to judaize that he may bring back the outward
  rite of the law, and subject the perfidy of the Jews to himself, he wishes the
  Sabbath to be observed.
  <p>For this which is said by the prophet, Ye shall bring in no burden through
  your gates on the Sabbath day (Jerem. xvii. 24), could be held to as long as
  it was lawful for the law to be observed according to the letter. But after
  that the grace of Almighty God, our Lord Jesus Christ has appeared, the
  commandments of the law which were spoken figuratively cannot be kept
  according to the letter. For, if any one says that this about the Sabbath is
  to be kept, he must needs say that carnal sacrifices are to be offered: he
  must say too that the commandment about the circumcision of the body is still
  to be retained. But let him hear the Apostle Paul saying in opposition to him,
  If ye be circumcised, Christ profiteth you nothing (Galat. v. 2).
  <p>We therefore accept spiritually, and hold spiritually, this which is
  written about the Sabbath. For the Sabbath means rest. But we have the true
  Sabbath in our Redeemer Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ. And whoso acknowledges
  the light of faith in Him, if he draws the sins of concupiscence through his
  eyes into his soul, he introduces burdens through the gates on the Sabbath
  day. We introduce, then, no burden through the gates on the Sabbath day if we
  draw no weights of sin through the bodily senses to the soul. For we read that
  the same our Lord and Redeemer did many works on the Sabbath day, so that he
  reproved the Jews, saying, Which of you doth not loose his ox or his ass on
  the Sabbath day, and lead him away to watering (Luke xiii. 15)? If, then, the
  very Truth in person commanded that the Sabbath should not be kept according
  to the letter, whoso keeps the rest of the Sabbath according to the letter of
  the law, whom else does he contradict but the Truth himself?
  <p>Another thing also has been brought to my knowledge; namely that it has
  been preached to you by perverse men that no one ought to wash on the Lord's
  day. And indeed if any one craves to wash for luxury and pleasure, neither on
  any other day do we allow this to be done. But if it is for bodily need,
  neither on the Lord's day do we forbid it. For it is written, No man ever
  hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it (Ephes. v. 29). And
  again it is written, Make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts
  thereof (Rom. xiii. 14). He, then, who forbids provision for the flesh in the
  lusts thereof certainly allows it in the needs thereof. For, if it is sin to
  wash the body on the Lord's day, neither ought the face to be washed on that
  day. But if this is allowed for a part of the body, why is it denied for the
  whole body when need requires? On the Lord's day, however, there should be a
  cessation of earthly labour, and attention given in every way to prayers, so
  that if anything is done negligently during the six days, it may be expiated
  by supplications on the day of the Lord's resurrection.
  <p>These things, most dear sons, being endowed with sure constancy and right
  faith, observe; despise the words of foolish men, and give not easy belief to
  all that you hear of having been said by them; but weigh it in the scale of
  reason, so that, while in firm stability you resist the wind of error you may
  be able to attain to the solid joys of the heavenly kingdom.
