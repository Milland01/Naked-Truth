<p align="center"><b><font size="5">The Search to Document and
Authenticate Vicarius Filii Dei<br>
</font><font size="4">as told by Robert Franklin Correia</font></b></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story begins at Loma Linda
[California]
back in 1941 where elder J. L. Shaw, former [Seventh-day Adventist]
General Conference Treasurer, was a patient, and I, a student at <b> <a
 href="http://www.lasierra.edu/">La Sierra College</a></b>, was his
night nurse. One night about midnight Elder Shaw couldn't sleep. <img
 alt="" src="http://biblelight.net/Robert F. Correia 1983.jpg" align="left" height="266"
 hspace="10" vspace="10" width="207">Something seemed to
disturb him. When asked why he was so restless he
replied: "I'm very worried. For many years we have been preaching that
the Pope has the title Vicarius Filii Dei which adds up to 666 and now
we have been challenged officially by the Catholic church to prove this
allegation by producing not some Protestant testimony; but reliable
Catholic sources."</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Elder Shaw told how it all started 
  with Elder [Francis D.] Nichol who had written an article in the &quot;Signs&quot; which 
  stated someone in Rome saw the title Vicarius Filii Dei on the Pope's tiara. 
  No sooner was this published, than Elder Nichol was challenged by an editor of 
  a Jesuit paper (by letter and by editorial) who wrote that Adventists for 
  years had maintained the Pope had this undocumented title and now the Catholic 
  church demanded that we either prove this or desist from preaching such 
  preposterous assumptions. [Apparently Nichol did not author any such article, 
  however a challenge was addressed to the editors of
  <em>Present Truth and Signs of the Times</em> by David Goldstein of Catholic Campaigners for Christ, 
  and published in<i> <a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Jun 2 1935.pdf"><strong>Our Sunday Visitor</strong></a></i><a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Jun 2 1935.pdf"><strong> on June 2, 1935</strong></a>, in apparent reply 
  to articles such as &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; by C. P. Bollman<i>,<em>
		  The Present Truth</em> </i> for 1922 - Vol. 38 - No. 06, March 16, 
  1922,
  <a href="http://docs.adventistarchives.org/docs/PT/PT19220316-V38-06__C/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=5">
  <strong>pgs. 5 &amp; 6</strong></a><i>. Our Sunday Visitor </i> is not a Jesuit publication, but 
  in his challenge Goldstein mentions Ernest R. Hull, 
  the Jesuit editor of <a href="http://www.the-examiner.org/"> <i><strong>The
Examiner</strong></i><strong> of Bombay, India</strong></a>, whose June 18, 1910 editorial on &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; 
  was adapted and summarized in
  <a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Nov 15 1914.pdf"><i><strong>Our Sunday Visitor</strong></i><strong>, Nov. 15, 1914</strong></a>.] </p>
	<p align="justify">Elder Nichol, who was known as
a great defender of the faith, did not take this challenge lightly. He
immediately wrote to our scholars around the world to share with him
any information they might have on this subject. Eventually it was put
in the hands of a special G. C. committee. So far nothing had resulted,
and our church for some years had discontinued to preach and publish
this, hoping somehow, someday, we would have more reliable evidence to
prove the Pope had this title.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="4">The General Conference of
Seventh-day Adventists</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a young, ardent theological
student, I was
so completely shocked to hear all this from a high official of our
church, that I decided to do what I could to help to defend our
position. I requested and received a letter of introduction from Elder
Shaw to Elder Howell, the chairman of the special committee. With my
wife and all my belongings in my "29 Ford" we headed for Washington,
D.C. which cost $25.00 for gas in those days. Arriving in Takoma Park,
I parked in front of the <b> <a href="http://www.adventist.org/">General
Conference</a></b> and presented my letter of introduction to Elder
Howell who said, "Who are you, and why are you here?" I replied that I
came to Washington volunteering to help discover evidence to
substantiate our position regarding the Pope's title. Elder Howell
said, "My young brother, for years we have had our best scholars around
the world working on this and so far we have not found anything
substantial. We even sent Elder Froom in a futile trip to the Vatican,
posing as a distinguished American scholar on a special research
assignment, and now here you are offering to help. What is your
background? How many languages do you speak? What gives you the
impression you can find something that we have been unable to find?"
Responding, I told Elder Howell that I was still in college; that I
felt like little David hoping somehow with God's help to do something
in defense of our church. Permission was granted by Elder Howell for me
to assist in the search for the Pope's title. I enrolled as a student
in Washington Missionary College [now <a href="http://www.wau.edu/"><strong>
  Washington Adventist University</strong></a>] and commenced my exhaustive research in the
religious deck of the Library of Congress. </p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="4">The Apostolic Legation</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone suggested that in the
inauguration of
the Pontiff, the title was used in his coronation. Assuming the
Apostolic Legation in Washington [now the Apostolic Nunciature of the
Holy See] was the best place to get the coronation litany, with another
student from W. M. C. who could speak Italian, we visited the Legation
where we posed as seminary students writing a special paper on the
"Holy Father" and as a fitting climax we were seeking a copy of the
coronation ceremony. We were informed by the Legation secretary that
the Archbishop temporarily was out of town and the best he could do was
to give us a letter of introduction to the [National] Catholic Welfare
Conference in downtown Washington, D.C.. Before leaving the Legation,
for some unaccountable reason (which later proved to be providential),
I requested and was granted the privilege of visiting their chapel
where the Pope [Pius XII] had his devotions when he was in America as
Papal Secretary of State.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="4">Catholic Welfare Conference</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the letter of introduction
from the Papal
Legation, we immediately visited the <b><a
 href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/whoweare.htm"> Catholic Welfare
Conference</a></b> (their General Conference) little realizing we held
in our hands the highest Catholic credentials. We were received with
the utmost courtesy and cooperation. While there, we learned that in
the Papal Coronation, the title Vicarius Christi is used (not Vicarius
Filii Dei). [See: <b> <a href="http://biblelight.net/Coronation-1939.htm">The Coronation of
Pope Pius XII</a></b>]</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="4">Our Sunday Visitor</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some years previous to this
time, one of our
ministers in Huntington, Indiana was able to get a photo-copy of an
article in <b><i> <a href="http://www.osv.com/">Our Sunday Visitor</a></i></b>
  (the largest Catholic weekly in America) which stated the Pope's tiara had the 
  title Vicarius Filii Dei. [<a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Apr 18 1915.pdf"><b>The April
18, 1915 article from <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i></b></a>] When this
information
was presented to the G. C. Committee, we were informed that one of
their influential members insisted that this source was unreliable
because in the very next issue of <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i>, the
editor published a denial indicating that he was mistaken about what
was mentioned in the previous issue regarding the Pope's title. In
order for us to check on this alleged denial, it was necessary to
review the back copies of <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> which the Library
of Congress informed us were available only at the publishing house in
Indiana. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this was our primary lead
thus far, we
decided to drive to Indiana to verify the original statement and the
alleged denial. My college buddy in this project was Conrad Stoehr from
Brazil, who was a linguist. This was during World War II and gas was
rationed. We went to an SDA service station in Takoma Park requesting
gas for our extra containers despite insufficient gas ration tickets.
We were informed this was not only impossible but also illegal. A
nearby stranger, hearing us insisted that this was not for us but for
the Lord, stepped forward and gave the attendant his whole book of
tickets (we never saw that man before or since). </p>
  <p align="justify"> <img src="http://biblelight.net/OSV-pc.jpg" align="left" border="0"
 height="255" hspace="12" width="389">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skipping our
college
classes, we drove day and night arriving in Huntington, Indiana the
next day at 15 minutes to 12 noon. Quickly we changed into our black
suits at a service station where we learned the location of the
publishing house. We arrived there as the town bell was tolling noon
and the workers were leaving the building&#8213;about the size of the R H.
(Review and Herald). We attempted to enter but were stopped by the
doorman who informed us that no more visitors were permitted for they
were closing for the week-end. However, we insisted saying we were
seminarians and had come a long distance from Washington, D.C. and
surely there must be someone to receive us. The security guard left us
and returned with the secretary to the editor who invited us inside
locking the door after all the employees had left. (It was providential
that she should be the one to receive us under such circumstances.) </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking us to her office, she
took special note
that we were both Latinos with black suits. She said: "I was told by
the doorman you were seminarians from Washington, D.C. Rarely do we
have such visitors. I have a sister that teaches at Catholic University
at the Capital. Which seminary do you attend?" We were hard-pressed for
a satisfactory answer; but a quick prayer caused us to reply: "You know
the location of the Atonement Seminary at C. U.? Our seminary is right
around the corner and over the hill." (Takoma Park). She seemed
delighted to escort us all through the publishing house. Returning to
her office she seemed to question who we were. She asked:
"Incidentally, you are Catholics, are you not?" turning to my buddy, I
said: "She asked us if we are Catholics. Just look at us. Catholicism
is the common faith of Latin people. My family and relatives have been
Catholics for many centuries." (which is true) Quickly changing the
subject, I asked her the strangest question: "What has been the most
memorable experience in your life?" With a gleam in her eyes, she said:
"When I was a young child, Cardinal Gibbons<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;</font>the
first American Cardinal&#8213;visited our home in Baltimore and took me on
his lap and my yellow locks got caught in the crucifix hanging from his
neck. My hair was so tangled my mother had to cut them and I have kept
them as a precious memory of the Cardinal." Turning to me she
questioned: "Now, what is your most special experience?" For a moment I
was at a loss to reply, then all of a sudden I remembered my visit to
the Papal Legation in Washington and now I had the answer: "My special
experience was a visit to the same chapel in the Papal Legation in
Washington, D.C. where the "Holy Father" had his private devotions when
he visited America as the Papal Secretary of State." This assured her
and from then on she appeared to be completely relaxed. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally she asked, "Is there
anything more you
would like to see?" I said, "Yes, we'd like to see the very first issue
of <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i>." She said, "This is a unique request for
it so happens we have the only complete file of this paper in all the
world, and you came to the right place to see it. Our back files are
locked upstairs in the editor's private library for safe keeping. He's
not here; but I have the key, so follow me." There she showed us the
first issue of the paper published in 1912 [May 5th], bound in yearly
volumes. Next, we requested to see the book of 1915 (in which [<b><a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Apr 18 1915.pdf">April
18, 1915.</a></b>] was
published the material regarding Vicarius Filii Dei). To our utter
dismay the 1915 book was missing. Then she told us she remembered that
because of certain unfortunate past experiences regarding certain
issues in 1915, that particular volume was kept in the private safe
downstairs in the editor's office. "However, the editor [<a
 href="http://www.osv.com/AboutUsNav/ArchbishopJohnNollBiography/tabid/396/Default.aspx"><b>John
F. Noll</b></a>] is out of town and I happen to know the safe
combination, so if you will excuse me, I'll get the 1915 volume." Soon
she returned with that particular volume&#8213;the special object of our
visit. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a strange thing happened.
She informed us
that the editor was a bit unorganized and if we'd excuse her for a few
minutes she was going to straighten out the documents in the safe. That
providential act gave us just the very opportunity for which we came.
Quickly and carefully we checked and found the original issue and
confirmed its statement regarding Vicarius Filii Dei and even had time
to go through several following issues and verify that there was no
subsequent denial by the editor. The Catholics strongly deny that the
present tiara of the Pope has any inscription; but they never have
denied that the Pope has the title of Vicarius Filii Dei. [Denials
appeared in the <b><a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Sep 16 1917.pdf">September 16, 1917</a> </b>and
  <b> <a href="http://biblelight.net/Sources/OSV Aug 3 1941.pdf">August 3, 1941</a></b> issues. However,
even today Catholic apologists will admit that Vicarius Filii Dei is
"theologically accurate", but at the same time they deny that it is an
"official" title. See: <b><a href="http://biblelight.net/envoy.htm#accurate">VICARIUS FILII
DEI and 666.</a></b>]</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we saw the original
statements, we
thought our work was completed; but how mistaken we were; for soon she
returned with several loose early copies of <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> 
  complaining the editor's safe was not well organized and so she straightened 
  it all out and was returning the loose copies to the library. As she 
  approached us with the rare copies in her arms, I noticed that the top paper 
  was the very one with the valuable quotation. My prayerful reaction: &quot;Lord 
  help get this paper for my church.&quot; Reaching out I requested to see one of 
  those early precious papers and picked up the top issue. Then something 
  unusual happened. As I looked at the printing at the top of the paper, wishing 
  I had it as my own, I noticed that it was published on April 18, 1915&#8213;the day 
  I was born. What a surprise! Calling this to her attention, I said, &quot;Miss 
  Cavanaugh, I have a special request: because of this remarkable coincidence, 
  I'm asking you to give this particular paper to me as an unforgettable 
  treasured souvenir of my visit here.&quot; With blushing face, she reminded me this 
  was the only extra copy in all the world; but I told her she would never know 
  how much it meant to me and after all we had come a long way for this visit. 
  Taking the paper from my hand, she replied: &quot;Since this issue was published on 
  the day you were born, I cannot deny such a request.&quot; Taking her pen she wrote 
  on the top of the paper: &quot;Happy birthday greetings&quot; and after signing her 
  name, Mary Helen Cavanaugh, she returned the paper to me. In the meantime, 
  while all this was taking place, my alert colleague was going through the rest 
  of the special stack of papers and found the two following issues which she 
  generously gave him upon his request. After thanking her for her unusual 
  kindness, we left.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We deeply felt then and still
believe to this
day that only the special blessing and guidance of God could have made
such success possible and give Him all the glory. The contributing
factors: we were both enthusiastic Latinos, both young seminarians,
both had staunch Catholic backgrounds, both dressed in black, both
loved and leaned heavily on the Lord, and the unique coincidence of my
birthday was the date of publication of the important issue which
stated Vicarius Filii Dei was the title of the Pope. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to Takoma Park, we
went directly to
the General Conference and reported to the special committee giving
them the copies, saying: "God gave these to us so that we can give them
to you." When it was verified that we returned with the only extra
original copy of <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> as well as two of the
following issues proving there was no denial of the Pope's title of
Vicarius Filii Dei, the brethren asked, "How was it possible to get
these valuable issues?" We indicated that it was not us but God who was
with us and whose blessing made it possible.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="4">Catholic University of America</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a consequence of this, the
committee
assigned Elders Yost [Dr. Frank R. Yost, Professor of Church History,
Adventist Theological Seminary, Washington D.C.] and Andreasen [Milian
Lauritz Andreasen (1876&#8211;1962), field secretary of the General
Conference (1941 - 1950)] as our mentors to advise and direct us to see
if something else could be turned up at <b><a href="http://cua.edu/">Catholic
University</a></b>. They indicated it might take six months or a year,
but to follow the leadings of the Lord. The very first day [Nov. 14?,
1942] we went to
C. U. dressed in our black suits as seminarians, we were astonished at
the reception we received. The professors tipped their hats to us in
respect to our sacred calling. We were not accustomed to such
treatment. As we approached the library desk, the man in charge stood
up as if seeing a ghost. Coming up to me and throwing his arms a round
me he stated: "Patricio, patricio." (Portuguese for "countrymen,
countrymen"). We had not yet said a word and here we were received in
this fashion. As he gave us his card he said: "I'm Dr. <b> <a
 href="http://books.google.com/books?id=or0SAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Cardozo%2C%20Manoel%20da%20Silveira%20Soares&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q=Cardozo,%20Manoel%20da%20Silveira%20Soares&amp;f=false">Cardozo</a></b>,
if you ever need any assistance, please call on me." We could hardly
believe that we would have such a unique reception within 15 minutes
after we arrived at C. U.. I responded that sometime at his convenience
we would like him to introduce us to their specialist on canon law. Dr.
Cardozo indicated that this was a simple request. <img alt=""
 src="http://biblelight.net/Monsignor Joseph Cifford Fenton.jpg" align="left"
 height="323" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="225">Reaching for the
phone, he made arrangements then and there for us to go to the office
of Dr. Fenton. [Monsignor <em style="font-style: normal;">Joseph
Clifford <b> <a
 href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lr0SAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Fenton.%20Rev.%20Joseph%20Clifford%22&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fenton.%20Rev.%20Joseph%20Clifford%22&amp;f=false">Fenton</a></b>
  </em>(1906-1969)<em style="font-style: normal;"> became editor of</em>
  <i> The American Ecclesiastical Review </i>(1944-1966) and is
considered one of most eminent theologians of the 20th Century.] When
we arrived at Fenton's office, we told him that we were seminarians
writing a special research paper on the "Holy Father" and wished to
verify if possible one of his titles which was Vicarius Filii Dei. <b><a
 href="http://biblelight.net/fenton.jpg">[The Fenton document]</a></b> Dr.
Fenton, at that point, phoned the office of the Rector of the
University, transmitting our request. Mgr. [Francesco Giuseppe] <b> <a
 href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lr0SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=Francesco+Lardone+CUA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=61ss7jSTKz&amp;sig=tYvuXiPMYuA1qyO7_3Yjz1OwuLI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sldATMWkJY-ksQPMvpX3DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Francesco%20Lardone%20CUA&amp;f=false">Lardone</a></b>
informed Dr. Fenton that this was a very special matter which he must
take up with the Papal Legation and requested us to return the next day
for an answer.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We returned to our advisers at
the General
Conference who, upon learning of all these rapid developments and
checking the men we had contacted at Catholic University, were very
concerned, for all of them were Jesuits and they counseled us to use
extreme caution. They said they would be praying for us as we continued
our C. U. contacts. The next day, when we returned to Dr. Fenton's
office, we were told to deal directly with the Rector's office, where
we were given an envelope stating that they had carefully checked and
found no source mentioning Vicarius Filii Dei as a title of the "Holy
Father." However, they requested that if we found this title in any
Catholic source, they would be willing to give us an appraisal of such.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several weeks, our G. C.
mentors made up
a packet of documents and told us to notify C. U. that we had documents
for their appraisal which contained the title Vicarius Filii Dei. One
Friday afternoon [March 5, 1943] I was mopping the floor at the college
cafeteria when
the phone rang which I answered. I was told that the Rector's office
was calling from C. U. advising me that Monsignor Lardone was ready to
appraise our documents. I immediately phoned my colleague, Conrad, who
was teaching a Portuguese language class of army officers in downtown
Washington. He replied that he couldn't come because it was against the
rules to cancel his class and suggested that I contact the GC to sent
someone in his place. They chose Elder Mondics to accompany me. I told
him to dress in black and remove all identification, because we were
dealing with Jesuits.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arriving at the office of the
Rector, we were
ushered into the presence of the Monsignor. It almost seemed we were
standing before Satan himself. Before us was a strange, bent-over man,
whose beady eyes seemed to penetrate within. Silently he stared at us
for a long <img alt="" src="http://biblelight.net/Francesco Lardone.gif" align="left"
 height="235" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="163">time as if wondering
who we were and what was our objective.
Formerly, he was the editor of the Vatican newspaper and now he was in
a very responsible position at Catholic University. After carefully
checking our documents, he commented first on the <a
 href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10576a.htm">Moroni</a> document,
saying he had used it in his classes and was unaware that it mentioned
the Pope's title, Vicarius Filii Dei. He translated this Italian
document* and said its reference to the Pope's title was vague.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Yost had previously briefed
us on all these
documents and at his suggestion, we said to Dr. Quasten: "Putting all
documents aside, do you as a recognized Catholic authority accept the
title Vicarius Filii Dei as a proper and legitimate title of the "Holy
Father?" At that point, Dr. Quasten asked me, "Why do you question me
about this title of the Pope?" I was on the spot, not knowing how to
respond. Suddenly I remembered that in the Catholic system (not always
in ours) great respect is shown to superiors. <img alt=""

 hspace="10" vspace="10" width="432">Now, I had the answer to his
question by
saying that we had just come from the office of his superior who had
sent us to him for his appraisal. (In other words, we, not he, were
authorized by his superior to ask the questions.) He got the point, and
obviously was a bit embarrassed since he had dared to question us. In a
submissive attitude, Dr. Quasten acknowledged, "The Pope has many
titles. Although Vicarius Filii Dei is not as common, it is, however,
an ancient title and should be accepted by any good Catholic scholar."
Suddenly I realized that his excellent testimony was insufficient
because it was only verbal. Speaking to him, I said, "Dr. Quasten, I
have a friend who has been working on this project who could not be
here today. We accept your appraisal but for the sake of my colleague,
would you be kind enough to write a simple statement that this is a
recognized and accepted title?" Dr. Quasten, questioned, "Is this
necessary? I responded, "If this is a legitimate title, why not admit
it in writing?" Instead of using his typewriter, Dr. Quasten pulled out
his pen and in his own handwriting wrote on official Catholic
University stationary the following: "The title <u>Vicarius Filii Dei</u>
as well as the title <u>Vicarius Christi</u> is very common as the
title for the Pope." and signed his name. [<a

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we returned with his
signed statement to
the General Conference, they could hardly believe what had happened.
They asked us, "How in the world did you get this?" We replied, "Don't
give us any credit, the Lord gave it to us for our church." Then they
reminded us that we had been dealing with the Jesuits and forbade us to
ever return to Catholic University; that our part was completed.
Calling in a lawyer and a notary, a statement of our witnessing the
Quasten's statement and signature was added to the bottom of the page
making it a legal deposition which was given to the General Conference
for safe-keeping. Several days later we were called before the full G.
C. Committee and given a personal commendation by Elder
McElhany&#8213;president of the General Conference. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preceding the coming of Christ,
there will be
an unmasking of the "Man of Sin" who is identified by a number which is
the number of a man and the number of his name. We are thankful to God
that we had a small part in the verification of that name whose Latin
letters make up that number and that our preachers and publications are
no longer inhibited in their proclamation of this important part of our
message.</p>
