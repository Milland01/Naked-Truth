FOR KEEPING THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH?</font></center>
<hr>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Our One Distinctive
View on the Law</font></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; <b></b>There is
  really only one difference between us and Protestants in general regarding the
  law. We understand the fourth commandment differently. We believe that the
  phrase <i>the seventh day </i>means the seventh day of the weekly cycle. And
  so did everyone else, until the end of the sixteenth century, when Nicholas
  Bownde developed the idea that the phrase meant simply one day in seven, and
  thus provided Puritan reformers with an apparent Scriptural support for
  Sundaykeeping. If our critics wish to prefer charges against us for failure to
  adopt a relatively new interpretation of a Scriptural phrase, we are ready to
  answer the charge with this simple inquiry: Why should we be asked to accept a
  new interpretation when the holy prophets and the apostles all understood the
  words <i>the seventh day </i>to mean the seventh day of the week? The holy
  women who rested on the day between crucifixion Friday and resurrection Sunday
  &quot;rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.&quot; Luke 23:56.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But even though our critics have to agree that our
  interpretation is anchored to history and the prophets, they seem still to be
  sure there must be something spiritually off-color, legalistic, in our keeping
  of the seventh day of the week, and particularly in our calling upon others to
  keep the seventh-day Sabbath. We may make impassioned appeal to the licentious
  man to flee from the wrath to come upon the head of all who violate the
  seventh command. We may do the same in regard to the thief, the liar, the
  murderer, the covetous man, the parent-dishonoring child, the blasphemer, and
  the idolater. To each we may say that his life is a violation of the law of
  God, which is binding on all men in all ages. To each</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 534]</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">we may appeal to implore God for
  forgiveness and for a new heart on which is written the law by the miraculous
  work of the Divine Spirit. Have not all great evangelists done this? Did not
  Dwight L. Moody preach a whole series of revival sermons on the Decalogue?
  (Later printed under the title <i>Weighed and Wanting.</i>)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we may do all this and be considered orthodox in the
  matter of grace and law. But let us include in our appeal to men the fourth
  commandment, and a storm breaks around our heads. Moody included the fourth
  commandment in his fervent series on the Decalogue. But no storm broke over
  him. No one accused him of legalism, of setting up another standard for
  salvation than Jesus Christ. But then Moody did not call on men to keep the
  &quot;Sabbath day according to the commandment&quot;; he called on them to
  keep holy the first day of the week!</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A Strange Situation</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; <b></b>Here is a
  strange situation indeed. It is even more strange when viewed in the setting
  of the fact that legalism is often directly involved in the urge that is put
  on people to keep Sunday. Have not our critics heard of Sunday laws that have
  been put on the statute books by ardent preachers, and vigorously invoked by
  them?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just why we who invoke only the grace of God to enable man
  to obey the command to keep holy the seventh day, should be charged as
  legalists, while the hosts of Sundaykeeping ministers, who often invoke the
  strong arm of the law in order to compel men to rest on the first day of the
  week, should claim to be the exponents of grace, is surely a strange
  contradiction. Seventh-day Adventists have ever been vigorous opponents of the
  idea of approaching Sabbath rest from a legal standpoint, whereas
  Sundaykeeping preachers are the ones who have lobbied almost every legislative
  body in Christian lands into enacting strong laws to protect Sunday! We who
  are Seventh-day Adventists must suffer the constant strictures of a large
  majority of the Sundaykeeping ministry for our refusal to support their
  program of Sunday legislation. They declare that we are in league with the
  lawless</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 535]</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">element who want an open Sunday.
  But whenever we urge the keeping of the seventh-day Sabbath, and invoke the
  law of God, some of those same ministers cry out that we are legalists! Why
  the difference?</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">A Situation Still
  More Strange</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To repeat the
  question asked earlier in this book, for it bears repeating: Just what is
  there about preaching first-day sacredness from the fourth commandment—as
  Protestant denominations in general have done through all the years—that
  transports such preachers to the balmy paradise of grace, whereas the
  preaching of seventh-day sacredness from the same fourth commandment consigns
  such preachers to the chill limbo of legalism? We who preach seventh-day
  sacredness certainly do not do so more sternly and rigorously than first-day
  preachers. Even a cursory acquaintance with Protestant history reveals that
  Sunday sacredness has quite frequently been proclaimed with a severity that
  frightened into conformity the majority and thrust into jail the remainder. If
  today there is a certain relaxation of this severity, it certainly does not
  reflect any fundamental difference of view toward the first day by religious
  leaders, for they bemoan the laxity that has crept in.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps some of our critics will say that they do not
  believe in this view of first-day sacredness. But that is surely not to the
  point. The charge of legalism is made by critics who represent a variety of
  Protestant bodies, which bodies have been parties to Sunday legislation. We
  therefore return to the question: Why is it a display of grace and faith to
  preach first day sacredness from the Decalogue, but a non-Christian display of
  legalism to preach seventh-day sacredness from the same law?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In substance, we are charged as being &quot;heretical&quot;
  because of our beliefs on the law in general and the fourth precept in
  particular. The question is: Wherein does the heresy lie? In our view of the
  law in general, that it is God's unchangeable code for all men in all ages?
  No, for we declare our complete harmony with</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 536]</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">the classic confessions of faith
  on this point. Is it because of our view of the fourth precept in particular?
  And if so, why, in view of the facts presented in the proceeding paragraphs?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time ago I fell into conversation with a Baptist
  minister. He deplored the Modernist-Fundamentalist controversy that was
  shattering his denomination. He said he judged that every denomination was
  thus troubled, however, I replied that ours was not. He marveled. No marvel. I
  said; the explanation is simple. Seventh-day Adventists could not possibly be
  evolutionists, for we keep the seventh day of the weekly cycle as a memorial
  of the completion of God's creative work in the first week of time. We keep
  this day holy because &quot;in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, ...
  and rested the seventh day.&quot; When we rest on the seventh day, we think of
  Him who rested on that day and blessed it. Ever remembering the Sabbath, we
  cannot forget creation. And ever believing in the Sabbath, we must ever
  believe in creation. We think rather of Eden than of Sinai when we keep the
  Sabbath.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete freedom from Modernism in the Seventh-day
  Adventist denomination, even in its colleges, is an eloquent proof of the
  truth of what we here claim regarding the Sabbath. Yet, behold, this Sabbath
  doctrine, which is our strong bulwark against Modernism, proves to be part of
  the reason for a withering indictment of us by Fundamentalists, in whose ranks
  our critics are generally found. ...</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 541]</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Sabbath Kept
  Joyfully</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is more,
  our critics know that Adventists keep the fourth commandment—the Sabbath
  command—with a joyfulness and sincerity with which they (the critics) fain
  would have their communicants keep Sunday. They know that while they, or their
  fellow opponents of Adventism, seek laws to undergird Sunday, Adventists keep
  the Sabbath without the aid of any legal statutes by the state, and are indeed
  militantly opposed to any legal approach to the matter of Sabbathkeeping.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, and our critics, who are generally of the
  Fundamentalist ranks, know that Adventists are untainted by skeptical,
  evolutionist doctrines, and that they are ever protected from such heresy by
  their weekly keeping of the Sabbath in memory of God's having created the
  heavens and the earth.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Warm and
  Spontaneous Liberality</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; <b></b>Our critics
  also know that Seventh-day Adventists give gladly and with a liberality that
  far out distances the giving of virtually all other churches in Christendom,
  and they know that such warm liberality could not spring from cold legalism.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides all this, our critics know that Adventists conduct
  a mission program out of all proportions to their size, that they go into the
  heart of Africa, the recesses of Asia, and the jungles of the South Seas, and
  that as a result of their preaching raw savages turn from</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 542]</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">devil worship, from filthy,
  enslaving habits, to live circumspect happy Christian lives. Our critics know
  that legalism is powerless to do this. Have they not, as good Fundamentalists,
  often declared that Modernists lack either the urge to go as missionaries or
  the power to transform lives if they went?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this and more must trouble the thinking of our critics
  in their quiet moments. We think it should!</font></p>
