  <title>The Contextual Biblical Exegesis Of 666 In Revelation 13:18</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">The Contextual Biblical Exegesis Of
666 In Revelation 13:18</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"><big>We will begin in the book of Daniel, which gives
us important information in a repeat and enlarge format regarding the
Antichrist that is paralleled in Revelation.</big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><big>Dan 7:8 I considered the horns, and, behold,
there came up among them another <b>little horn</b>, before whom there
were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in
this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, <b>and a mouth speaking
great things.</b></big></p>
    <p align="left"><big>Dan 7:19 Then I would know the truth of the
fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding
dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which
devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;<br>
Dan 7:20 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other
which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had
eyes, and <b>a mouth that spake very great thing</b>s, whose look was
more stout than his fellows.</big></p>
    <p align="left"><big>Dan 7:25 And he shall <b>speak great words
against the most High</b>, ...</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>Now to Daniel 8 for the parallel there:</big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><big>Dan 8:9 And out of one of them came forth a <b>little
horn</b>, ...<br>
Dan 8:10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast
down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon
them.<br>
Dan 8:11 Yea, <b>he magnified himself even to the prince of the host</b>,
...</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>We continue to the willful king of Daniel 11:</big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><big>Dan 11:36 And the king shall do according to
his will; and <b>he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above
every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods,</b></big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>Next to Paul's second epistle to Thessalonica:</big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><big>2 Th 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means:
for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first,
and that <b>man of sin</b> be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
2 Th 2:4 Who opposeth and <b>exalteth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God</b>.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>The key to understanding this important
characteristic of the Antichrist is found in Revelation, where it is
very clearly defined for us:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Rev 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea,
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten
horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the <b> <u>name
of blasphemy.</u></b></big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>Note that this "name of blasphemy" is associated
with <i> all</i> the heads of the sea beast. The word translated
"name" of blasphemy in Rev. 13:1 is <i>onoma</i>:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>G3686. onoma, on'-om-ah; from a presumed der.
of the base of G1097 (comp. G3685); a "name" (lit. or fig.) [authority,
character]:--called, (+ sur-) name (-d).</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>The same word is translated "name" in the
following verse:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Rev 13:6 And <b>he opened his mouth in
blasphemy against God, to </b> <u><b>blaspheme his nam</b>e</u>, and
his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>Now, who cannot immediately see that in Daniel
7, 8, 11, and 2 Thes. 2:3-4 the great words, the words by which he, the
Antichrist, magnifies himself, are blasphemous words, from Revelation
13? The Antichrist is not an open violent opposer of Christ, he is a
subtle usurper within the church that is guilty of blasphemy. This
"name of blasphemy" of the sea beast is again mentioned in the key
verses that are the focus of this discussion:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Rev 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell,
save he that had the mark, or <b> <u>the name of the beast, or the
number of his name.</u></b><br>
Rev 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is
Six hundred threescore and six.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>So from the blasphemous name of the beast from
the sea, the Antichrist, the number 666 can be counted. </big></p>
  <p align="left"><big>The solution to the enigma:</big></p>
  <ul>
    <big> </big>
    <li><big> </big>
      <p align="left"><big>The mark of authority of the papal system is
that it thinks to change times and laws of the most high (Dan. 7:25)
This is defined clearly in Rev. 14:7 by the first angel's message as
the pre-advent judgment and the Sabbath commandment.</big></p>
      <big> </big></li>
    <big> </big>
    <li><big> </big>
      <p align="left"><big>The blasphemous name of the beast, which is
in fact a title, is Vicarius Filii Dei, by which the papal system
usurps Christ's authority, claiming for itself the power to dispense
with the law of God, or modify it at will. Two commandments of God's
law have been altered by the papacy, the second regarding idolatry, and
the fourth regarding the seventh day Sabbath. The title clearly reveals
the character of the Antichrist, in fact Antichrist and Vicarius Filii
Dei are synonymous, they both mean one who takes the place of Christ, a
usurper.</big></p>
      <big> </big></li>
    <big> </big>
    <li><big> </big>
      <p align="left"><big>We are told to find a boastful blasphemous
title that yields six hundred sixty six <i>arithmetically</i>. The
number six hundred sixty six is the <u>number of his name</u>
(arithmos G706 onoma G3686) mentioned in Rev. 13:17,18, and 15:2. The
number is not readily apparent from the title, it must be counted or
reckoned, as the text clearly indicates.</big></p>
      <big> </big></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <blockquote><big> </big>
      <p align="left"><big>G706. arithmos, ar-ith-mos'; from G142; a
number (as reckoned up):--number.<br>
G3686. onoma, on'-om-ah; from a presumed der. of the base of G1097
(comp. G3685); a "name" (lit. or fig.) [authority, character]:--called,

the reader to count the number of the beast. There John uses the word
psephizo (G5585) for "count", which is derived from G5586, the same
Greek word that composes Isopsephy. John was indicating that
numerology, counting the numeric value of a name, was the way to arrive
at the solution of six hundred
sixty six. "Pythagorean sources

indicate that this practice goes back at least six or seven centuries

These each have a different numerical value. They are&nbsp; Chi = 600,
Xi = 60, Stigma = 6. Papyrus 47 (P47) is considered to be perhaps the
earliest extant copy of any portion of Revelation. Early church fathers
within a few years of Revelation being penned were already applying
isopsephy (Greek), gematria (Hebrew), or Roman numeral values to solve
the riddle.</big></p>
  <p><big><b><font size="4"><big><a
 href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08130b.htm"> St. Irenaeus of
Lyons</a> (c. 130-202)<br>
  </big></font></b>Adversus haereses (inter A.D. 180/199)<br>
Book V, Chapter 30</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p><big>1. Such, then, being the state of the case, and this number
being found in all the most approved and ancient copies [of the
Apocalypse], and those men who saw John face to face bearing their
testimony [to it]; while reason also leads us to conclude that the
number of the name of the beast, [if reckoned] according to the Greek
mode of calculation [isopsephy] by the [value of] the letters contained
in it, will amount to six hundred and sixty and six; that is, the
number of tens shall be equal to that of the hundreds, and the number
of hundreds equal to that of the units (for that number which
[expresses] the digit six being adhered to throughout, indicates the
recapitulations of that apostasy, taken in its full extent, which
occurred at the beginning, during the intermediate periods, and which
shall take place at the end) ...</big></p>
    <big> </big>
    <p><big>Moreover, another danger, by no means trifling, shall
overtake those who falsely presume that they know the name of
Antichrist. For if these men assume one [number], when this
[Antichrist] shall come having another, they will be easily led away by
him, as supposing him not to be the expected one, who must be guarded
against. ...<br>
    <br>
2. These men, therefore, ought to learn [what really is the state of
the case], and go back to the true number of the name, that they be not
reckoned among false prophets. But, knowing the sure number declared by
Scripture, that is, six hundred sixty and six, let them await, in the
first place, the division of the kingdom into ten; then, in the next
place, when these kings are reigning, and beginning to set their
affairs in order, and advance their kingdom, [let them learn] to
acknowledge that he who shall come claiming the kingdom for himself,
and shall terrify those men of whom we have been speaking, having a
name containing the aforesaid number, is truly the abomination of
desolation. ...</big></p>
    <big> </big>
    <p><big>3. It is therefore more certain, and less hazardous, to
await the fulfillment of the prophecy, than to be making surmises, and
casting about for any names that may present themselves, inasmuch as
many names can be found possessing the number mentioned; and the same
question will, after all, remain unsolved. For if there are many names
found possessing this number, it will be asked which among them shall
the coming man bear. It is not through a want of names containing the
number of that name that I say this, but on account of the fear of God,
and zeal for the truth: for the name Evanthas (EUAN QAS) contains the
required number, but I make no allegation regarding it. Then also
Lateinos (LATEINOS) has the number six hundred and sixty-six; and it is
a very probable [solution], this being the name of the last kingdom [of
the four seen by Daniel]. For the Latins are they who at present bear
rule: ...</big></p>

is calculated: Lambda (30), Alpha (1), Tau (300), Epsilon (5), Iota
(10), Nu (50), Omikron (70) and Sigma (200), giving a total of six
hundred and sixty six.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p><big>Irenaeus, while also noting 3 sixes in the first paragraph,
and equating that with apostasy, wisely recommends subsequently that no
serious attempt be made to solve the riddle until it becomes plainly
evident who it should be applied to when the little horn of Daniel 7 is
identified, as he has a zeal for the truth and a fear of God. This
method will eliminate erroneous results. This methodology is not
evident in Herb's video <font size="3"><big> <b><a
 href="http://vimeo.com/15027758">What is
666?</a></b> He needs to retract it.</big></font></big></p>
  <p align="left"><big>Below is verse 18 in the Greek <a
 href="http://www.libertyparkusafd.org/lp/Burgon/electronic books/Greek New Testament (Textus Receptus) Scrivener 1894.pdf">
Textus Receptus</a>. Again, as in P47, at the end of the verse we have
Chi Xi Stigma, 600 60 6.</big></p>
  <p align="center"><big><img src="rev13-18.gif" border="0" height="97"
 width="817"></big></p>
  <p align="left"><big>Attempts to interpret this based on 6 tripled
are erroneous, that is <i>not</i> how it is expressed. The total
calculation is the number six hundred sixty six, not 3 sixes. See also
this <a href="http://bible.zoxt.net/hex/_1298.htm">1841 English Hexpla</a>
which has the Greek and 6 English translations. Below is verse 18 in
the <a href="http://www.csntm.org/Manuscript/View/GA_02">Codex
Alexandrinus</a>. Here the Greek in
the bottom line reads <b>hexakosioi</b> (six-hundred) <b>hexakonta</b>
(sixty) <b>hex</b> (six). Click the image to see the whole page.</big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"> <a

  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><big>Below is Revelation 13:18 in the <a
 href="http://www.codexsinaiticus.com/en/manuscript.aspx?book=59&amp;chapter=13&amp;lid=en&amp;side=r&amp;verse=18&amp;zoomSlider=0">Codex
Sinaiticus</a>.<br>
&nbsp;Beginning
on the second line from the bottom it reads <b><br>
hexakosioi</b> (six-hundred),&nbsp; <b>hexakon<br>
ta</b> (sixty)&nbsp; <b>hex</b> (six)<b> ·</b></big></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"> <img src="sinaiticus.jpg" border="0"
 height="278" width="472"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>Again it is
not expressed as three sixes, but rather six hundred sixty six. The
three sixes / imperfect number 6 interpretation is a case of eisegesis,
forcing into the text something that simply is not there. The number
666 mathematically is 111 sixes, if you must, not 3, and we are told to
count the <i>number of a name</i>, not to discern a symbolic meaning
from 6, or from 666. For the next important bit of
context in
this mystery, we notice this verse:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Rev 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on
his
thigh a <u> name</u> written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>The same Greek word<i> onoma</i> is used in that
verse for "name". Note that it refers to a <i>Title of Jesus</i>. So
Revelation 13:1, 6, 17 and 18 can refer to a <i> blasphemous title</i>
assumed by the heads of the sea beast. In the Hebrew of Isaiah we also
see a name can be a title: </big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Isa 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a
son
is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his <u>name</u>
shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
Father, The Prince of Peace.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>The same wisdom that unlocks the name/number of
the
sea beast is mentioned in Revelation 17:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Rev 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit
into
the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, <u>full
of names of blasphemy</u>, having seven heads and ten
horns.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>So there are <i>many</i> blasphemous titles
assumed
by the Antichrist, not just the one in particular that adds up to 666.</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>Rev 17:9 And here is the mind which hath
wisdom.
The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>When all the other characteristics of the
Antichrist
are listed and examined first, and only then the subsequent addition of
what is presented here, this points us directly and unerringly with
laser-like precision to the apostate harlot woman (church) seated in
Rome, the Roman Catholic Church.</big></p>
  <p align="left"><big>So, now let's let scripture tell us a definition
of
blasphemy:</big></p>
  <blockquote><big> </big>
    <p align="left"><big>John 10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again
to
stone him.<br>
John 10:32 Jesus answered them, <font color="#ff0000">Many good works
have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone
me?</font><br>
John 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man,
makest thyself God.</big></p>
    <big> </big></blockquote>
  <p align="left"><big>With the above in mind:</big></p>

that is, he is head of the family in the place of Christ, Luke 12:42.</big></font></big></p>

  <p align="left"><big>So, among the blasphemous titles of the popes,
which
the Bible so clearly reveals to be the Antichrist, is there one from
which we can count the number 666? Yes, VICARIVS FILII DEI (Taking the
place of, or substitute for the Son of God) is a blasphemous title that
has a long history of use in Roman Catholic documents, to include
official Apostolic Constitutions (papal bulls), and it does equal 666
when the Roman numeral value of the letters are added up. See <a
 href="666.html">http://biblelight.net/666.htm</a>
for the historical documentation. Whether it ever appeared on a tiara
or not is no longer of any importance, although I believe it probably
did.</big></p>
  <p align="left"><big>It is also worth noting that Roman Catholics,
while
denying any "official" standing for VICARIVS FILII DEI, will readily
admit that the synonymous VICARIVS CHRISTI is the proper and official
papal title (it does not add up to 666). Well, another perfectly valid
way of saying VICARIVS CHRISTI is ANTICHRIST, both of which mean
"Taking the place of, or a substitute for Christ".</big></p>
