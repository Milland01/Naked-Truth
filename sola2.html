<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>When discussing the topic of Sola Scriptura (the Bible only for doctrine)
  with Catholics, you are like to run into something similar to the following
  rational from the Experts Forum of EWTN to discredit it:</p>

            of the Bible in early history<br>
            Question from Brian on 12-05-1999:</a></b>
            <p>I have three arguments, dealing with the history of the early
            Church, against those who believe in the &quot;Bible Alone&quot;
            theory, and I'm wondering about the validity of these statements:</p>
            <p>1) Isn't it true that written manuscripts, of any kind, were VERY
            rare to the &quot;common folk&quot; and peasants back in the days of
            the early Church?</p>
            <p>2) Isn't it true that a full-length Bible would be VERY expensive
            back then, virtually putting it out of the reach of most of these
            common folk?</p>
            <p>3) Isn't it true that most peasants and commoners simply couldn't
            read or write back in the time of the early Church, so even if they
            did have a Bible, it wouldn't do them much good without some oral
            teaching?</p>
            <p>Based upon these 3 statements, it seems to me that its simply
            common sense to say that oral tradition was necessary in early
            Church history, to keep Christ's teachings alive. Are these fair
            statements to make?</p>
            <p><b>Answer by Warren H. Carroll, Ph.D on 12-06-1999:</b></p>
            <p>These are all excellent arguments against Sola Scripture.</td>

  <p>The above premise is that Sola Scriptura fails if you do not have access to
  or own a personal copy of the Bible, but that is a total misconception of the
  Sola Scriptura principal. It is quite true that the Protestants made every
  effort to put a vernacular Bible into the hands of the laity despite strenuous
  efforts of the Catholic Church to prevent it. Protestants wanted everyone to
  be able to read the Word of God in their own tongue, in a Bible they could
  call their own, but that is not the meaning of Sola Scriptura. The term was
  coined by Martin Luther, who was trying to reform the Church and return it to
  scriptural truths that Tradition had so effectively obscured. Sola Scriptura
  is epitomized by Martin Luther's appearance at the Diet of Worms:</p>
  <p>The Archbishop of Trier, John Eck asked Martin Luther:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I ask you, Martin - answer candidly and without horns - do you or do you
    not repudiate your books and the errors which they contain?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To which Luther replied,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Since then Your Majesty and your lordships desire a simple reply, I will
    answer without horns and without teeth. Unless I am convicted by Scripture
    and plain reason - I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for
    they have contradicted each other - my conscience is captive to the Word of
    God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience
    is neither right nor safe. Here I stand, I can do no other. God help me.
    Amen.&nbsp; (Martin Luther, the Diet of Worms - April 18, 1521)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because the Bible was effectively locked away from the common people while
  in Latin, and very scarce too, the reformers felt compelled to translate it
  into the common languages that people could read, and make it cheaply, so that
  <i>every</i> church might have one. Even the average person could then hope to
  eventually own and read his own copy of the Bible. But distribution of the
  Bible among the laity was viewed as a dangerous threat to Catholic authority
  and Church Tradition and stirred the anger of the Church, whose Traditions
  were exposed as apostasy. They diligently went about banning and burning as
  many vernacular Bibles (and its owner or translator) as they could get their
  hands on, until the task became unmanageable, and then impossibly huge.</p>
  <p>The Catholic mentality was that if the Bible could be kept scarce (in the
  custody of the Church) and in Latin, the laity would remain ignorant of what
  it really contained, and Church Authority and Tradition would be unchallenged.
  The Catholic Church also claimed sole authority to interpret Scripture's
  meaning, and declared anyone who dared to depart from its definitions (like
  Martin Luther) was a criminal, punishable under the law:</p>

          his own conception, presume to interpret them contrary to that sense
          which holy Mother Church, to whom it belongs to judge of their true
          sense and interpretation, has held and holds, or even contrary to the
          unanimous teaching of the Fathers, even though such interpretations
          should never at any time be published. Those who act contrary to this

  <p>Martin Luther was standing firmly on Scripture as his only guide and
  counselor regarding doctrine, and not the dictates of popes or Church councils
  which were contrary to the Word of God and promoted their own unbiblical
  Traditions. This is the true meaning of Sola Scriptura, and it is not
  dependent on the availability of the Bible to each and every person. Were
  there only a single copy of the Bible in existence, Sola Scriptura would not
  be diminished in the slightest degree. It would still contain the authentic
  Word of God and be the only sure ruler for faith and doctrine, to the complete
  exclusion of Church Councils, Traditions, and Papal decrees. One need not be
  able to read, or even have a Bible, for Sola Scriptura to be in effect.</p>
  <p>Let the pulpits and churches echo with the doctrines of the Gospel found in
  God's Word, the Holy Scriptures, and not with the Traditions and decrees of
  men, whether there be only one Bible or as many as the leaves of Autumn - <i>that</i>
  is Sola Scriptura and the only safe ground on which to stand!</p>
