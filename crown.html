<p class="auto-style3">I have come as a pilgrim to the house of 
	the blessed statue of Our Lady of Charity, <i>la Mambisa</i> as you call 
	upon her with affection. Her presence in this town of El Cobre is a gift 
	from heaven for all Cubans. ... </p>
	<p align="left" class="auto-style3">Let all those you meet know, whether 
	near or far, that I have entrusted to the Mother of God the future of your 
	country, advancing along the ways renewal and hope, for the greater good of 
	all Cubans. &mdash;

	Benedict XVI</a>: Tuesday, 27 March 2012.</p>
	<p align="left" class="auto-style3">I too greatly have wished to come among 
	you as a pilgrim of charity, in order to thank the Virgin Mary for the 
	presence of her venerable statue of the Sanctuary of El Cobre, whence for 
	four centuries she has accompanied the journey of the Church in this nation 
	and given encouragement to all Cubans ... </p>
	<p align="left" class="auto-style3">As I bid you a heartfelt <i>adios</i>, I 
	ask our Lady of Charity of El Cobre to protect all Cubans under her mantle, 
	to sustain them in the midst of their trials and to obtain from Almighty God 
	the grace that they most desire. <i>Hasta siempre, </i>Cuba, a land made 
	beautiful by the maternal presence of Mary. &mdash;

	Benedict XVI</a>: Wednesday, 28 March 2012.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">This is a blatant example of how far Catholicism has 
departed from the Gospel of Jesus Christ, corrupting it's biblical simplicity 
with pagan idolatry. The Bible does not teach that Mary has ever been given any 
intercessory or mediatorial role that she carries out in heaven. In fact, the 
Bible clearly explains that:</p>
<p class="auto-style3">1 Tim 2:5 (KJV)&nbsp;For <i>there is</i>
<a id="essa" name="33752x4"></a>one God, and <a id="essa0" name="33752x7"></a>
one <a id="essa1" name="33752x8"></a>mediator between God and men, the man 
Christ Jesus; <br>1 Tim 2:5 (KJV)&nbsp;Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be 
testified in due time. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style6">&nbsp;In the Old Testament, the unique mediatorial role 
of Jesus was typified by the high priest of the Hebrew sanctuary. No woman was 
ever allowed to minister in the sanctuary in a priestly role. It is an absolute 
impossibility that Mary is engaged in any such role in a biblical Gospel, rather 
it is an antichrist doctrine of deception that perverts the true Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. The Bible does not teach that Mary was ever taken to heaven, or that she 
is anything more than dead in the grave, awaiting her resurrection at the second 
coming. It was Satan's first lie in the garden of Eden that:</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Gen 3:4 (KJV) And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye 
shall not surely die:</p>
<p class="auto-style6">The Catholic zeal for attributing special abilities and 
powers to the idols Mary and other saints is pure pagan pantheism and idolatry, 
strictly condemned by God. Catholics will strenuously object that they are not 
guilty of idolatry, that they are merely "venerating" what they know to be a 
statue, and that this does not constitute a transgression of God's law, because 
this veneration is directed not to the statue of wood, stone, silver or gold, 
but rather their veneration is directed to the worthy person depicted, and so is 
acceptable and pleasing to God. But the Bible does not teach this to be an 
acceptable practice. Merely the act of bowing down before any statue constitutes 
the sin of idolatry, it is clearly prohibited and condemned by God in very 
strong terms:</p>
<p class="auto-style3">Ex 20:4 (KJV)&nbsp;Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven 
image, or any likeness <i>of any thing</i> that <i>is</i> in heaven above, or 
that <i>is</i> in the earth beneath, or that <i>is</i> in the water under the 
earth: <br>Ex 20:5 (KJV)&nbsp;Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve 
them: for I the <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">Lord</span> thy God <i>am</i> 
a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the 
third and fourth <i>generation</i> of them that hate me;</p>
