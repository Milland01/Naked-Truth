<p><font size="5">The Oath of a Jesuit Catholic during the Reformation.</font></p>
</center></strong>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>The following oath is said to be on record in Paris, among the &quot;Society of 
  Jesus&quot;, the Jesuits.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The Jesuits Oath.</em> -- I, A. B., now in the presence of Almighty 
    God, the blessed Virgin Mary, the blessed Michael the archangel, the blessed 
    St. John Baptist, the holy apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, and the saints 
    and sacred hosts of heaven, and to you my ghostly father, do declare from my 
    heart, without mental reservation, that his holiness Pope Urban is Christ's 
    vicar general, and is the true and only head of the Catholic or universal 
    church throughout the earth; and that by the virtue of the keys of binding 
    and loosing given to his holiness by my Saviour Jesus Christ, he hath power 
    to depose heretical kings, princes, states, commonwealths, and governments, 
    all being illegal, without his sacred confirmation, and that they may safely 
    be destroyed; therefore, to the utmost of my power I shall and will defend 
    this doctrine, and his holiness's rights and customs against all usurpers of 
    the heretical (or Protestant) authority whatsoever; especially against the 
    now pretended authority and Church of England, and all adherents, in regard 
    that they and she be usurpal and heretical, opposing the sacred mother 
    Church of Rome. I do renounce and disown any allegiance as due to any 
    heretical king, prince, or state, named Protestants, or obedience to any of 
    their inferior magistrates or officers.</p>
    <p>I do further declare, that the doctrine of the Church of England, of the 
    Calvinists, Huguenots, and of other of the name Protestants, to be damnable, 
    and they themselves are damned, and to be damned, that will not forsake the 
    same. I do further declare, that I will help, assist, and advise all, or any 
    of his holiness's agents in any place, wherever I shall be, in England, 
    Scotland, and Ireland, or in any other territory or kingdom I shall come to; 
    to do my utmost to extirpate the heretical Protestants' doctrine, and to 
    destroy all their pretended powers, regal or otherwise. </p>
    <p>I do further promise and declare, that notwithstanding I am dispensed 
    with to assume any religion heretical for the propagating of the mother 
    church's interest, to keep secret and private all her agents' counsels from 
    time to time, as they intrust me, and not to divulge, directly or 
    indirectly, by word, writing, or circumstances whatsoever; but to execute 
    all that shall be proposed, given in charge, or discovered into me, by you 
    my ghostly father, or by any of this sacred convent. </p>
    <p>All which I, A. B., do swear by the blessed Trinity, and blessed 
    sacrament, which I now am to receive, to perform, and on my part to keep 
    inviolably; And do call all the heavenly and glorious host of heaven to 
    witness these my real intentions to keep this my oath. In testimony hereof, 
    I take this most holy and blessed sacrament of the eucharist; and witness 
    the same further with my hand and seal in the face of this holy convent, 
    this ------- day of -------- An. Dom., &amp;c. <font face="Times New Roman">—</font>

  <blockquote>
    <p>I ______, now in the presence of Almighty God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, 
    the Blessed Michael the Archangel, the Blessed St. John the Baptist, the 
    Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and all the Saints, sacred hosts of Heaven, 
    and to you, my ghostly Father, the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, 
    founded by St. Ignatius Loyola, in the Pontification of Paul the Third, and 
    continued to the present, do by the womb of the virgin, the matrix of God, 
    and the rod of Jesus Christ, declare and swear that his holiness, the Pope, 
    is Christ's Vice-regent, and is the true and only head of the Catholic or 
    Universal Church throughout the earth; and that by the virtue of the keys of 
    binding and loosing, given to his Holiness by my Savior, Jesus Christ, he 
    hath power to depose heretical kings, princes, states, commonwealths and 
    governments, all being illegal without his sacred confirmation, and that 
    they may be safely destroyed.</p>
    <p>I do further declare, that I will help and assist and advise all or any 
    of his Holiness' agents in any place wherever I shall be, and do my utmost 
    to extirpate the heretical Protestant or Liberal doctrines and to destroy 
    all their pretended powers, legal or otherwise. </p>
    <p>I do further promise and declare, that notwithstanding I am dispensed 
    with to assume any religion heretical, for the propagating of the Mother 
    Church's interest, to keep secret and private all her agents' counsels, from 
    time to time as they may instruct me, and not to divulge directly or 
    indirectly, by word, writing, or circumstances whatever; but to execute all 
    that shall be proposed given in charge or discovered unto me, by you, my 
    ghostly father. ... </p>
    <p>I do further promise and declare, that I will have no opinion or will of 
    my own, or any mental reservation whatever, even as a corpse or cadaver but 
    unhesitatingly obey each and every command that I may receive from my 
    superiors in the Militia of the Pope and Jesus Christ. </p>
    <p>That I will go to any part of the world, whatsoever, without murmuring 
    and will be submissive in all things whatsoever communicated to me. ... I do 
    further promise and declare, that I will, when opportunity presents, make 
    and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, 
    Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do to extirpate and 
    exterminate them from the face of the whole earth, and that I will spare 
    neither sex, age nor condition, and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, 
    strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics; rip up the stomachs and 
    wombs of their women and crush their infants heads against the wall, in 
    order to annihilate forever their execrable race. </p>
    <p>That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poison 
    cup, the strangulation cord, the steel of the poniard, or the leaden bullet, 
    regardless of the honor, rank, dignity or authority of the person or persons 
    whatsoever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at 
    any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or superior of 
    the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith of the Society of Jesus. </p>
