<p><font size="6">THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES<br>
</font>by William Cathcart, D.D.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</font>U <font size="4">P</font>IN 
  declares that: &quot;In the first three centuries, yes, and in the beginning of the 
  fourth, images were very scarce among Christians. Towards the end of the 
  fourth century they began, especially in the East, to make pictures and 
  images; and they grew very common in the fifth; they represented in them the 
  conflicts of martyrs and sacred histories to instruct those who could not 
  read. Those of the simpler sort, moved by these representations, could not 
  forbear expressing the esteem, respect, and veneration they had for those 
  represented therein. Thus was image worship established.&quot; *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is no doubt when paganism was the prevailing religion, 
  but that it would have been dangerous for Christians to have had images, 
  because they might have given occasion of idolatry to those just reclaimed 
  from it; and they might have given the pagans reason to object to Christians, 
  that they had, and worshipped idols as they did; therefore it was fitting that 
  there should be <i>no images in those first ages, especially in churches, and 
  that there should be no worship paid them.</i>&quot; *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This statement is truthful, and for a friend of image 
  worship, extremely candid. The practice became general over the East, but was 
  unknown in England, France, and Germany, though in these Western nations the 
  worship of relics was universal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In A. D. 730, Leo the Isaurian issued an imperial edict 
  ordering images to be removed out of the churches and sacred places, 
  commanding them to be thrown into the fire, and inflicting penalties upon 
  those who ventured to disobey him. The decree was generally executed in the 
  East, though it excited a great amount of indignation.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="right">[pg. 329]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantine Copronymus, the son and successor of Leo, 
  assembled a council of 338 bishops at Constantinople, A. D. 754, to complete 
  the work of his father.* They showed the sternest opposition to the worship of 
  images of Christ, and of the saints; they denounced it as a taint of 
  heathenism, condemned by the Scriptures, and by such fathers as Chrysostom and 
  Athanasius; and they forbade the use of all images in private houses or 
  churches. The effort of Constantine seemed to be successful, that is, it 
  controlled the public acts of his subjects, but evidently failed to carry 
  their consciences along with it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Empress Irene was instrumental in calling a council, 
  which permanently settled the controversy in favor of the worship of images; 
  though quietness did not immediately fall upon the excited passions of men.† 
  Her synod met first at Constantinople A. D. 786, but was scattered by military 
  violence; it assembled afterwards A. D. 787, at Nice. It numbered 350 bishops, 
  and passed a number of argumentative and idolatrous decrees in favor of the 
  worship of images. And as this synod gave shape to all subsequent views and 
  conflicts about images, we present a portion of one of its celebrated decrees.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We ‡ therefore as is aforesaid, honor and salute, and 
  honorably worship the holy and venerable images, that is to say, the image of 
  the humanity of our Great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and of our immaculate 
  lady, and holy Mother of God, of whom he was of our immaculate lady, of whom 
  he was pleased to be made flesh, and to save and turn us away from impious 
  love of idols; and the forms and representations of the holy and incorporeal 
  angels, for they also appeared to the righteous as men; in like manner of the 
  divine apostles, worthy of all praise,</p>

  <p>and of the inspired prophets, of the victorious martyrs, and of holy men.&quot; 
  . . . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the doctrine of Adrian, then pope, and the decisions 
  of the council were speedily received in Italy; but in France, Charlemagne 
  opposed them with the greatest vehemence, and had a work prepared by the 
  famous Aleuin, and issued in his name, denouncing the <i>adoration</i> of 
  images. He did not object to their presence in churches, but the worship 
  demanded for them by the second synod of Nice was an intolerable iniquity. He 
  sent the book to the pope by Angilbert his embassador; and His holiness 
  replied to the work of Aleuin.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>Charlemagne against images.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever ridiculous distinction Rome has 
  tried to recognize between the worship of images and that of God, a 
  distinction which first appears in the decrees of the second Council of Nice, 
  Charlmagne only saw in these idolatrous edicts: &quot;<i>adoration, worship.</i>&quot; 
  His book says of the prelates of the second Council of Nice: &quot;The bishops of 
  this synod order images to be adored;&quot; &quot;Whenever they find images spoken of 
  either in the Scriptures or in the writings of the fathers, they conclude from 
  them that they ought to be worshipped.&quot; * &quot;Let us,&quot; adds he, &quot;adore God 
  alone.&quot; He declares that &quot;miracles performed by images are no proof that they 
  should be adored, for then thorn bushes should be adored, because God spake to 
  Moses out of a burning bush; fringes should be adored because Jesus Christ 
  healed the woman who touched the fringe of his garment; and shadows too, 
  because St. Peter's shadow wrought miracles.&quot; The whole controversy between 
  Charlemagne and the pope and council was based on the <i>worship</i> of 
  images. He honored them so far as to permit them to remain in the churches. He 
  would not worship them. The pope and second council insisted that they should 
  be adored, and cursed all who did not worship them. † And the empire of 
  Charlemagne and the Christian world, in the process of time, followed Irene, 
  Pope Adrian, and the second Synod of Nice.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="right">[pg. 331]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing could be more untruthful or 
  pernicious than the principle upon which the bishops of the Deutero-Nicene 
  Council justified their idolatry. &quot;He, who worships the figure,&quot; said the 
  council, &quot;worships the substance of that which is represented by it.&quot; * 
  According to this theory every heathen in the world could plead exemption from 
  the charge of idol-worship under the pretence that he adored the great God 
  represented by a statue of Jupiter, or by the shining sun. Myriads have 
  worshipped images in Christian churches without exercising a thought beyond 
  the figure itself. And they have reverenced one image, rather than another 
  representing the same adored one, because of some special virtue supposed to 
  dwell in that particular image.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>Other Catholic Authorities copy the exact Spirit, if not 
  the Letter,<br>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council of Trent says: † &quot;Moreover the images of 
  Christ, of the Virgin mother of God, and of the other saints are to be had and 
  retained particularly in temples, and that due honor and veneration are to be 
  awarded them; not that any divinity or virtue is in them on account of which 
  they are to be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of them, or that 
  confidence is to be reposed in images as was of old done by the Gentiles, who 
  place their hope in idols; but because the honor which is shown unto them is 
  referred to the prototype which they represent.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>Creed of Pope Pius IV.</i></p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Moreover it is not only lawful to have 
  images in the Church and to pay them honor and worship.&quot; † . . . . . .<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such, then, are the fundamental laws for the government of 
  the Papal Church about the worship of images. From the very start, it was not 
  mere honor to the pictures or statues of saints; Charlemagne was willing to 
  render that; it was the <i>veneration, adoration, the burning of incense, 
  worship.<br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote the worship of images, wonderful prodigies were 
  narrated about them.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>A Statue of Jesus bleeds.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In A. D. 561, a Jew, ‡ by stealth, carried 
  off a statue of Christ, out of a church, and having brought it unobserved to 
  his house, he pierced it with a dart; and, as he was going to burn it in the 
  fire, he found himself bathed in blood which flowed from the wounded image. 
  Greatly terrified, he changed his mind, and concealed the wonderful wood. The 
  Christians sought for it, and found it by means of the traces of blood, and 
  recovered it, stained with gore. They subsequently stoned the Jew for his 
  impiety.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>An Image of Jesus speaks.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a celebrated synod § convened by St. 
  Dunstan, at Winchester, in the heat of a violent discussion, the image of the 
  Lord, in the church, close to the disputants, spoke distinctly: &quot;Expressing 
  such opinions as rendered the secular clergy dumb.&quot;</p>

  <p align="center"><i>An image of the Virgin works Prodigies.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; At Sardenai, * six miles from Damascus, A. D. 
  1204, there lived a venerable nun, who sadly lamented the fact that she had no 
  image of the Virgin to show her features when she offered up her prayers. A 
  certain monk promised to bring her an image or picture of Mary from Jerusalem. 
  He forgot his promise; and, as he started out of Jerusalem, a voice from 
  heaven said to him: &quot;Where is the image thou didst promise to take to the 
  nun?&quot; He felt rebuked, and immediately returned and procured the image. As he 
  left the holy city again and came to Gith, a fierce lion, accustomed to eat 
  men, came to meet him and licked his feet. Afterwards, robbers came forth to 
  assail him, but the voice of an angel rebuked them, and frightened them away. 
  Seeing the power of the image, he concluded he would keep it; and he went to 
  sea to reach his home, but a violent storm compelled all on board to cast 
  their goods into the sea; and as he was about to throw his baggage into the 
  ocean, an angel forbade him, and said: &quot;Lift the image up towards the Lord;&quot; 
  he obeyed, and immediately there was a calm. He took it quickly as possible to 
  the nun, who erected a suitable house for such a wonderful figure, and 
  forthwith it began to drip oil, and it never ceased sending it forth from that 
  time. Then the image formed breasts of <i>flesh</i>, and below them it was 
  covered with flesh. This image performed great numbers of miracles; and, among 
  other marvels, it gave sight to the blind Sultan of Damascus, who prostrated 
  himself in prayer before it. &quot;The image then began to be greatly revered by 
  all, and every one admired the great and wonderful works of God in it.&quot;</p>

  out of a tree that grew on Mount Olivet, and painted by St. Luke while the 
  artist was asleep; it is an ugly-looking babe. † The Church

  especially at the birth of children. On these</p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the church of St. Salvador, there is an 
  ancient image of Jesus. It has a wig on its head, it face looks black and 
  disfigured, its features are so indistinct that you are not certain which sex 
  it is intended to represent; it is located in a small chapel behind the choir. 
  This image can work great miracles. When any public calamity is threatened it 
  is always ready. And as a consequence it enjoys the devout worship and the 
  warm love of the whole people for many miles around. When rain is needed so 
  badly that the harvest is threatened, a day is fixed to take out the crucifix 
  attended by its friends. The procession is composed of the priests, friars and 
  devout people, with visible marks of penance. The archbishop, viceroy and 
  magistrates assist in robes of mourning. Twelve priests dressed in black, take 
  the crucifix on their shoulders; and wherever the procession moves the 
  crucifix is adored as if its wooden Jesus was the very flesh and blood of the 
  Son of God. It is naïvely added, that &quot;The image is never taken out but when 
  there is a great want of rain, and when there is <i>sure appearance of 
  plenteous rain</i>; so they are never disappointed in having a miracle 
  published after such a procession.&quot; †</p>

  10. Nor to thy neighbor's goods aspire.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In no way does this prayer-book, &quot;so widely 
  circulated,&quot; recognize the second commandment; while it mutilates and divides 
  the tenth to obtain a substitute for the expunged second.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &quot;Key of Heaven,&quot; * another well-known Catholic 
  prayer-book, recommended by Archbishop Hughes, makes precisely the same 
  changes in the decalogue, and utterly ignores the commandment forbidding the 
  manufacture and worship of graven images.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One distinguished writer on the papal controversy says: &quot;In 
  the ordinary catechisms used in Great Britain by Roman Catholics the second 
  commandment is expunged from the decalogue, and the tenth is split into two to 
  preserve the number of ten.&quot; † Another author, who had made a very extensive 
  examination of catechisms, says: &quot;Here there are twenty-nine catechisms in use 
  in Rome and in Italy, France, Belgium, Austria, Bavaria, Silesia, Poland, 
  Ireland, England, Spain, and Portugal, and in twenty-seven of them the second 
  commandment is totally omitted; in two it is mutilated, and only a portion 
  expressed.&quot; ‡<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is there any difference between the Vulgate version of 
  this commandment and our own to justify this extraordinary procedure. The 
  Catholic translation into English faithfully renders it: &quot;Thou shalt not make 
  to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven 
  above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters 
  under the earth; thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them.&quot; §<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where Roman Catholics have no Bible they are ignorant of 
  any such divine prohibition of image worship. Belcher quotes a missionary of 
  Malta whose teacher, an Italian, observed the ten commandments in a tract on 
  his table one morning, and imme-</p>

  <p align="left">diately expressed great surprise at the second, and asked if 
  it was a part of the decalogue. Mr. Temple, the missionary, showed him this 
  commandment in Martini's translation of the Vulgate. As he read it in a work 
  authorized by the pope, he exclaimed: &quot;I have lived fifty years; I have been 
  publicly educated in Italy, but till this hour I never knew that such a 
  commandment was written in the pages of the Bible.&quot; *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is in the solemn prohibitions of Sinai, and no earthly 
  authority can remove it from the place assigned it by the Almighty Jehovah. 
  And while it is unrepealed, the worship of any image is an act of forbidden 
  idolatry; more detestable in one claiming to be a Christian than in any 
  devotee of heathenism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of its hatefulness to the God of the Bible, the compilers 
  of the &quot;Mission Book&quot; and other &quot;Manuals of Worship,&quot; and of various 
  catechisms, are fully aware; and for this reason alone they blot it out of the 
  ten commandments, that it may not condemn the degraded adoration rendered to 
  images, which their worship so constantly exhibits.</p>

    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08459b.htm">Damascene</a> (De Fide 
    Orth. iv, 16) quotes <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02330b.htm">
    Basil</a> as saying: &quot;The
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> given to an 
    image reaches to the prototype,&quot; i.e. the exemplar. But the exemplar 
    itself--namely,
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Christ<!--</a>-->--is to be
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> with the
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->adoration<!--</a>--> of &quot;<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>&quot;; 
    therefore also His image. </p>
    <p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As the
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01713a.htm">Philosopher</a> says 
    (De Memor. et Remin. i), there is a twofold movement of the
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> towards an
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->image<!--</a>-->: one indeed towards 
    the image itself as a
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->certain<!--</a>--> thing; another, 
    towards the image in so far as it is the image of something else. And 
    between these movements there is this difference; that the former, by which 
    one is moved towards an image as a certain thing, is different from the 
    movement towards the thing: whereas the latter movement, which is towards 
    the image as an<!--k03--><!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->image<!--</a>-->, 
    is one and the same as that which is towards the thing. Thus therefore we 
    must say that no reverence is shown to
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->image<!--</a>-->, as a thing--for 
    instance, carved or painted wood: because reverence is not due
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->save<!--</a>--> to a rational 
    creature. It follow therefore that reverence should be shown to it, in so 
    far only as it is an
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->image<!--</a>-->. Consequently the 
    same reverence should be shown to
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> image as 
    to <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself. 
    Since, therefore, <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">
    Christ</a> is <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a>

    </p>
    <p><strong>I answer that,</strong> As stated above (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4025.htm#3">Article 
    3</a>), <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> or 
    reverence is due to a rational creature only; while to an insensible 
    creature, no <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> 
    or reverence is due
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->save<!--</a>--> by reason of a 
    rational <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. 
    And this in two ways. First, inasmuch as it represents a rational
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: secondly, 
    inasmuch as it is united to it in any way whatsoever. In the first way
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->men<!--</a>--> are wont to venerate 
    the king's
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->image<!--</a>-->; in the second way, 
    his robe. And both are venerated by
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with the same 
    veneration as they show to the king. If, therefore, we speak of the
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->cross<!--</a>--> itself on which
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was 
    crucified, it is to be venerated by us in both ways--namely, in one way in 
    so far as it represents to us the figure of
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> extended 
    thereon; in the other way, from its contact with the limbs of
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and from 
    its being saturated with His blood. Wherefore in each way it is
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->worshiped<!--</a>--> with the same
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->adoration<!--</a>--> as
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, viz. the
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->adoration<!--</a>--> of &quot;<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09036a.htm">latria</a>.&quot; 
    And for this reason also we speak to the
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->cross<!--</a>--> and
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to it, as to 
    the
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->Crucified<!--</a>--> Himself. But if 
    we speak of the effigy of

    whatever--for instance, in
    <!--k03-->
    <!--<a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">-->stone<!--</a>--> or wood, silver or 
    gold--thus we venerate the
    <!--k03-->
