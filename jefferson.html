  <p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Thomas Jefferson's Draft Bill for Religious
  Freedom <br>
  (Proposed in </strong>1777<strong>)</strong></font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><strong>A BILL FOR ESTABLISHING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM </strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>SECTION I.</strong></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="6">W</font>ELL aware that <em>the opinions
  and belief of men depend not on their own will, but follow involuntarily the evidence
  proposed to their minds; that </em>Almighty God hath created the mind free, <em>and
  manifested his supreme will that free it shall remain by making it altogether
  insusceptible of restraint;</em> that all attempts to influence it by temporal
  punishments, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of
  hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our
  religion, who being lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions
  on either, as was in his Almighty power to do, <em>but to exalt it by its influence on
  reason alone;</em> that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well
  as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed
  dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as
  the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath
  established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through
  all time: That to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of
  opinions which he disbelieves <em>and abhors</em>, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the
  forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving
  him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose
  morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to
  righteousness; and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards, which
  proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to
  earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have
  no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or
  geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by
  laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he
  profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those
  privileges and advantages to which, in common with his fellow citizens, he has a natural
  right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles of that very religion it is meant to
  encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, those who will
  externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not
  withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; <em>that
  the opinions of men are not the object of civil government, nor under its jurisdiction;</em>
  that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion and to
  restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency
  is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of
  course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or
  condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own;
  that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government for its officers to
  interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and
  finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself; that she is the proper
  and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict unless by
  human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors
  ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.</p>
  <p><strong>SECTION II. </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><font size="6">W</font>E the</em> [<big>B</big><small>E it
  therefore enacted by the</small>]* General Assembly <em>of Virginia do enact</em> that no
  man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry
  whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or
  goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but
  that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in
  matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their
  civil capacities. </p>
  <p><strong>SECTION III. </strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="6">A</font>ND though we well know that this Assembly,
  elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to
  restrain the acts of succeeding Assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and
  that therefore to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are
  free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights
  of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to
  narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right.</p>
