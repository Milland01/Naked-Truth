  <hr>
  <p>Mario Derksen's article is presented in the boxes, and my comments in
  rebuttal follow them.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">Seventh-Day Adventists (SDAs) love to spread their
          teaching that the Pope must be the Antichrist and the Catholic Church
          the Whore of Babylon.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, if you don't know much about your Catholic faith, their
          arguments may sound very convincing, and, of course, they look like
          they are &quot;Bible-based.&quot; Oh well. You can tell the Bible has
          become the play-toy of heretics, for countless different denominations
          which all teach different things say their teachings are
          &quot;Bible-based.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          But anyway. I already have issued a challenge against the SDAs about
          the 666 game, and it has so far remained unanswered. If you're a SDA,
          please check out my challenge <a
          href="http://www.cathinsight.com/apologetics/adventism/666.htm">&quot;The
          Pope, the Beast, and 666.&quot;</a> Here now, though, I would like to
          give brief but irrefutable proof that the Catholic Church cannot be
          satanic, not the Whore of Babylon, and therefore the Pope cannot be
          the Antichrist. How am I going to do this? Easy. I'm going to use the
          Bible. The Catholic Church is accused of being satanic; she is said to
          be the &quot;apostate church.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Well, our Savior Jesus Christ had, when He was on earth, kind of the
          same problem. He was driving demons out, and so some said He was doing
          this by the power of the devil. What did Jesus respond? Let me quote
          it for you:
          <blockquote>
            <p><b>Mark 3:23-26</b><br>
            <br>
            And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables:
            How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against
            itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against
            itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan be risen up against
            himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Jesus responded that if He were of the devil, He could not drive
          out demons, because that would not work, for &quot;a divided kingdom
          cannot stand.&quot; Satan would be destroying himself in the process.<br>
          <br>
          Now, listen to this:<br>
          The Catholic Church <b>drives out the devil, too. This practice is
          called &quot;exorcism.&quot;</b> You can't deny that the Catholic
          Church has been doing exorcisms on people and driven out Satan that
          way for nearly two millennia. Therefore, we must reason just like
          Jesus: if the Catholic Church were from the devil, it could not drive
          the devil out. For, as Jesus said, &quot;A divided kingdom cannot
          stand.&quot; The Catholic Church, however, has been standing for
          nearly 2,000 years. Jesus refuted the argument that He is of the devil
          by saying that Satan could not stand then, and I claim the same about
          the Church.</p>
          <p>This now is my quick-response to any and all arguments of the SDAs.
          There is no need for me to refute any other argument as long as there
          is no qualified and effective counter-response by the SDAs.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:22 <font color="#FF0000">Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
    Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out
    devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</font><br>
    Mat 7:23 <font color="#FF0000">And then will I profess unto them, I never
    knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that at the end of time <i>many </i>will say to the Lord they have
  done many wonderful works in His name, to include casting out devils, a
  practice Catholics define as exorcism. However, as the above passage in
  Matthew makes quite clear, even those who profess to cast out devils (perform
  exorcisms) <i>can indeed be workers of iniquity</i>.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">As a last point, the Bible plainly tells us what kind
          of person the Antichrist is: <b>1 John 2:22</b>: &quot;Who is a liar,
          but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who
          denieth the Father and the Son. SDAs would have to admit that the
          Catholic Church does NOT deny the Father, or the Son, or the Holy
          Ghost--just browse through any Catholic catechism.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

  </div>
  <p>On the contrary, Adventists need admit no such thing, the evidence being to
  the contrary. Regarding 1 John 2:22, see my essa<font size="3">y <img
  border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="antichrist_and_jesus.html"><b>Antichrist: Denying Jesus Christ is Come in
  the Flesh</b></a><b> </b>which goes into this point in some detail, and shows
  quite clearly that the Roman Catholic Church in fact denies Jesus is <i><b>the</b></i>
  Christ, and so deny the Father as well.</font></p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%"

          Scripture, cannot possibly be the Whore of Babylon, nor the Pope the
          Antichrist.</td>
