        <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Amazing Papal Quotes on God's Law</font></b></p>
        <hr>
  <p>Excerpts from Pope Benedict XVI's speech, given during the papal audience 
  for the international congress on natural law, Feb. 12th, 2007:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;It is precisely in the light of this contestation that all the 
          urgency of the necessity to reflect upon the theme of natural law and 
          to rediscover its truth common to all men appears. The said law, to 
          which the Apostle Paul refers (cf. Rom 2:&nbsp;14-15), is written on the 
          heart of man and is consequently, even today, accessible.&quot;</p>
          <p>&quot;This law has as its first and general principle, 'to do good and to 
          avoid evil'.&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
  <p>The Pope also stated regarding God's law being written in the heart:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;They are, in fact, norms that precede any human law: as such, they are 
    not subject to modification by anyone.&quot;<br>
        ...<br>
        &quot;Therefore, no law made by man can override the norm written by the 
    Creator without society becoming dramatically wounded in what constitutes 
    its basic foundation.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here is the scripture on the law of God that the Pope referred to: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 2:13 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the 
    doers of the law shall be justified.<br>
    Rom 2:14 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the 
    things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto 
    themselves:<br>
    Rom 2:15 Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their 
    conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing 
    or else excusing one another;)</p>

        <p>The only law written by the Creator, by His own finger on tables of 
        stone, was the Ten Commandments. This law, which according to scripture 
        is to be written in the hearts of the Christian, which the Pope says no 
        one can alter, the Catholic Church has boldly thought to change (Dan 
        7:25), by substituting Sunday keeping in place of keeping the seventh 
        day Saturday Sabbath (Exodus 20:8-11).</p>

<span class="text">
              <b>I. THE NATURAL MORAL LAW</b> 
  <p><b>1954</b> Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Creator who 
  gives him mastery over his acts and the ability to govern himself with a view 
  to the true and the good. The natural law expresses the original moral sense 
  which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil, the truth and 
  the lie: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd><span class="text1">The natural law is written and engraved in the soul 
    of each and every man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good 
    and forbidding him to sin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But this command of human reason would not 
    have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a higher 
    reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be submitted.<sup>5</sup>
    </span></dd>
  </dl>
  <p><b>1955</b> The &quot;divine and natural&quot; law<sup>6</sup> shows man the way to 
  follow so as to practice the good and attain his end. The natural law states 
  the first and essential precepts which govern the moral life. It hinges upon 
  the desire for God and submission to him, who is the source and judge of all 
  that is good, as well as upon the sense that the other is one's equal. Its 
  principal precepts are expressed in the Decalogue. This law is called 
  &quot;natural,&quot; not in reference to the nature of irrational beings, but because 
  reason which decrees it properly belongs to human nature: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd><span class="text1">Where then are these rules written, if not in the 
    book of that light we call the truth? In it is written every just law; from 
    it the law passes into the heart of the man who does justice, not that it 
    migrates into it, but that it places its imprint on it, like a seal on a 
    ring that passes onto wax, without leaving the ring.<sup>7</sup> The natural 
    law is nothing other than the light of understanding placed in us by God; 
    through it we know what we must do and what we must avoid. God has given 
    this light or law at the creation.<sup>8</sup> </span></dd>
  </dl>
  <p><b>1956</b> The natural law, present in the heart of each man and 
  established by reason, is universal in its precepts and its authority extends 
  to all men. It expresses the dignity of the person and determines the basis 
  for his fundamental rights and duties: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd><span class="text1">For there is a true law: right reason. It is in 
    conformity with nature, is diffused among all men, and is immutable and 
    eternal; its orders summon to duty; its prohibitions turn away from offense 
    . .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To replace it with a contrary law is a sacrilege; failure to apply 
    even one of its provisions is forbidden; no one can abrogate it entirely.<sup>9</sup>
    </span></dd>
  </dl>
  <p><b>1957</b> Application of the natural law varies greatly; it can demand 
  reflection that takes account of various conditions of life according to 
  places, times, and circumstances. Nevertheless, in the diversity of cultures, 
  the natural law remains as a rule that binds men among themselves and imposes 
  on them, beyond the inevitable differences, common principles. </p>
  <p><b>1958</b> The natural law is <i>immutable </i>and permanent throughout 
  the variations of history;<sup>10</sup> it subsists under the flux of ideas 
  and customs and supports their progress. The rules that express it remain 
  substantially valid. Even when it is rejected in its very principles, it 
  cannot be destroyed or removed from the heart of man. It always rises again in 
  the life of individuals and societies: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd><span class="text1">Theft is surely punished by your law, O Lord, and by 
    the law that is written in the human heart, the law that iniquity itself 
    does not efface.<sup>11</sup> </span></dd>
  </dl>
  <p><b>1959</b> The natural law, the Creator's very good work, provides the 
  solid foundation on which man can build the structure of moral rules to guide 
  his choices. It also provides the indispensable moral foundation for building 
  the human community. Finally, it provides the necessary basis for the civil 
  law with which it is connected, whether by a reflection that draws conclusions 
  from its principles, or by additions of a positive and juridical nature. </p>
  <p><b>1960</b> The precepts of natural law are not perceived by everyone 
  clearly and immediately. In the present situation sinful man needs grace and 
  revelation so moral and religious truths may be known &quot;by everyone with 
  facility, with firm certainty and with no admixture of error.&quot;<sup>12</sup> 
  The natural law provides revealed law and grace with a foundation prepared by 
  God and in accordance with the work of the Spirit. </p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p><b>1978</b> The natural law is a participation in God's wisdom and goodness 
  by man formed in the image of his Creator. It expresses the dignity of the 
  human person and forms the basis of his fundamental rights and duties. </p>
  <p><b>1979</b> The natural law is immutable, permanent throughout history. The 
  rules that express it remain substantially valid. It is a necessary foundation 
  for the erection of moral rules and civil law. </p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p><b>The Decalogue and the natural law </b></p>
  <p><b>2070</b> The Ten Commandments belong to God's revelation. At the same 
  time they teach us the true humanity of man. They bring to light the essential 
  duties, and therefore, indirectly, the fundamental rights inherent in the 
  nature of the human person. The Decalogue contains a privileged expression of 
  the natural law: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd><span class="text1">From the beginning, God had implanted in the heart 
    of man the precepts of the natural law. Then he was content to remind him of 
    them. This was the Decalogue.<sup>31</sup></span></dd>
  </dl>
  <p><b>2071</b> The commandments of the Decalogue, although accessible to 
  reason alone, have been revealed. To attain a complete and certain 
  understanding of the requirements of the natural law, sinful humanity needed 
  this revelation: </p>
  <dl>
    <dd><span class="text1">A full explanation of the commandments of the 
    Decalogue became necessary in the state of sin because the light of reason 
    was obscured and the will had gone astray.<sup>32</sup> </span></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>We know God's commandments through the divine revelation proposed to us in 
  the Church, and through the voice of moral conscience. </p>
  <p><b>The obligation of the Decalogue</b> </p>
  <p><b>2072</b> Since they express man's fundamental duties towards God and 
  towards his neighbor, the Ten Commandments reveal, in their primordial 
  content, <i>grave </i>obligations. They are fundamentally immutable, and they 
  oblige always and everywhere. No one can dispense from them. The Ten 
  Commandments are engraved by God in the human heart. </p>

<h3>How The Third Differs From The Other Commandments </h3>
</center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the exposition of this Commandment, the faithful 
are carefully to be taught how it agrees with, and how it differs from the 
others, in order that they may understand why we observe and keep holy not 
Saturday but Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The point of difference is evident. The other Commandments of 
the Decalogue are precepts of the natural law, obligatory at all times and 
unalterable. Hence, after the abrogation of the Law of Moses, all the 
Commandments contained in the two tables are observed by Christians, not indeed 
because their observance is commanded by Moses, but because they are in 
conformity with nature which dictates obedience to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This Commandment about the observance of the Sabbath, on the 
other hand, considered as to the time appointed for its fulfilment, is not fixed 
and unalterable, but susceptible of change, and belongs not to the moral, but 
the ceremonial law. Neither is it a principle of the natural law; we are not 
instructed by nature to give external worship to God on that day, rather than on 
any other. And in fact the Sabbath was kept holy only from the time of the 
liberation of the people of Israel from the bondage of Pharaoh. The observance 
of the Sabbath was to be abrogated at the same time as the other Hebrew rites 
and ceremonies, that is, at the death of Christ. Having been, as it were, images 
which foreshadowed the light and the truth, these ceremonies were to disappear 
at the coming of that light and truth, which is Jesus Christ. Hence St. Paul, in 
his Epistle to the Galatians, when reproving the observers of the Mosaic rites, 
says: <i>You observe days and months and times and years; I am afraid of you 
lest perhaps I have laboured in vain amongst you.</i><sup>8</sup> And he writes 
to the same effect to the Colossians.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So much regarding the difference (between this and the other 
Commandments).</p>
