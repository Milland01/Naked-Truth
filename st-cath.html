<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps the boldest thing, the most revolutionary change the Church ever
  did, happened in the first century. The holy day, the Sabbath, was changed
  from Saturday to Sunday. &quot;The Day of the Lord&quot; (dies Dominica) was
  chosen, not from any directions noted in the Scriptures, but from the Church's
  sense of its own power. The day of resurrection, the day of Pentecost, fifty
  days later, came on the first day of the week. So this would be the new
  Sabbath. People who think that the Scriptures should be the sole authority,
  should logically become 7th Day Adventists, and keep Saturday holy.</p>
