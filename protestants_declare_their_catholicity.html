<blockquote>
    <p style="font-size: medium">A curious contradiction happens nearly every year. Virtually all
the Christian world will observe the death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ in unison, on the first Sunday after the first full moon after
the Spring Equinox as decreed by the Council of Nicea in 325 A.D.
However, if this paschal full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is then
moved to the next Sunday. The Council of Nicea also decided that the
Christian Easter shall never precede or coincide with the Jewish
Passover, but must always follow it, a rule still observed by the
Eastern Orthodox Church, but not the Western Church. The Eastern
Orthodox church also still uses the Julian calendar to calculate
Easter, and so frequently does not agree with the Western Church on
dates.This presents a very interesting situation, since the Protestants
generally will subscribe to the motto of Sola Scriptura, the Bible only
for doctrine, yet the Catholic affirms the authority of Church
Tradition.Now if you strictly follow the Bible as your guide as to when to
observe Passover, you would ALWAYS be observing the crucifixion in the
middle of the biblical month, very close to the full moon. This is
because Passover the Bible tells us, is celebrated on 14 Abib/Nisan, the middle of 
  the 29.5 day lunar cycle (the synodic month). </p>
  <blockquote>
      <p><span style="font-size: medium">Deut 16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the
	  </span>
	  <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps; font-size: medium;">Lord</span><span style="font-size: medium"> thy God: for in the 
	  month of Abib the </span> 
	  <span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps; font-size: medium;">Lord</span><span style="font-size: medium"> thy 
	  God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.&nbsp;
	  Lev 23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the
Lord's passover.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p style="font-size: medium">The biblical month will have either 29 or 30 days, and begins 
  with the observation of the new moon (crescent visible), and ripening 
  barley. Because Passover is specifically designated as the
14th day of the 1st month, Passover is always in close
proximity to the full moon. Ripened barley is required on 16 Nisan/Abib for
the waving of first fruits (Lev. 23:10-11). If the barley is too
immature at the sighting of the new moon, a 2nd Adar leap 13th month is
declared, and the month of Nisan/Abib is delayed to the next month. The following
calendars illustrate the difference between the biblical determination
of Passover and the tradition of Easter Sunday. </p>
	<p align="left" style="font-size: medium">
		In 2015, ripening barley was found <a href="http://www.paleotimes.org/">
		March 15th</a>, and the new moon was sighted at sunset beginning
		<a href="http://renewedmoon.com/">March 22nd</a>, making it the first 
		day of Abib / Nisan, which puts Passover (14 Nisan), on Saturday, April 
		4th, and first fruits/Omer/resurrection day (16 
		Nisan), on Monday, April 6th.&nbsp; Easter will be observed Sunday, 
		April 5th.</p>
	<p align="left">
		<span style="font-size: x-large">
		<span style="text-align: left; font-size: medium">For 2014,
			ripening barley was found in Israel on March 24th-25th, and 
			the <a href="http://shawnrichardson.com/new-moon-report/">new moon was 
			observed March 31st</a>, which began the 
			month of Abib/Nisan. The biblical Resurrection day (First Fruits) 
			will be Tuesday, April 15th, the day of the full moon, while 
			Easter will be observed Sunday, April 20th.</span></span></p>

	<p align="left" style="text-align: left; ">For 2013, 
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/karaite_korner_news/">ripening barley 
	was found in Israel on March 11th</a>, 29 Adar, but the new moon was not 
	sighted until&nbsp; March 13th, which begins the month of Abib/Nisan. The biblical 
	Resurrection day (First Fruits) will be Thursday, March 28th, the day after 
	the full moon, while Easter will be observed March 31st. </p>

	<p style="text-align: left">
	In 2012, the observed new moon after sunset ending Friday, 
  March 23, began Nisan/Abib, as ripened Barley was reported found in Israel 
  that day and the day before. So 1 Nisan of 2012 is Saturday, March 24. 
  Passover, 14 Nisan and the full moon falls in 2012 on Friday, April 6, and 16 
  Nisan, the First Fruits / Resurrection, on Sunday, April, 8th, coinciding this 
  year with Easter as observed by Protestants and Western Catholic Christianity.

	<p align="left">For 2011, the new moon of March 6th began the 13th
month of Adar II, as the barley was not ripened. Abib Barley was
reportedly found in the <a
 href="http://www.shemayisrael.net/articles/firstfruit-barley-2011.html">Jordan
valley on March 22</a>, the day after the equinox, and the new moon was
seen in Israel after the sunset that began April 5th, the first day of
the new month of Nisan/Abib.&nbsp; Passover, 14 Nisan/Abib, was
therefore on Monday, April 18th, and the biblical resurrection day, 16
Nisan/Abib, was on Wednesday, April 20th. Easter however, as set by the
unbiblical tradition of Nicea, was observed by most Christians on
Sunday April 24th.<br>

  <p>Now isn't this a remarkable contradiction: "Bible Only"
Protestantism has clearly cast aside the Bible as their teacher on this
matter, and will celebrate "Easter" always on Sunday, a day that has <i>no</i>
biblical foundation. Aren't Protestants, in practical effect, openly
declaring they are actually followers of Catholic Tradition, and care
nothing for the instructions of the inspired word of God, Scripture,
which they claim to be their <i>only</i> guide? Isn't this a rather
transparent case of hypocrisy on the part of "Bible Only" Protestants?
Aren't they really declaring every Easter (and Pentecost), <i>we are
Catholics and prefer Tradition over God's word! ?</i></p>
  <p>Indeed they are! The New Testament commemoration of Christ's
resurrection is the baptism of believers by full immersion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into
Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?<br>
Rom 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life.<br>
Rom 6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his
death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<br>
Rom 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.<br>
Rom 6:7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.<br>
Rom 6:8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also
live with him:<br>
Rom 6:9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;
death hath no more dominion over him.<br>
Rom 6:10 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he
liveth, he liveth unto God.<br>
Rom 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,
but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
