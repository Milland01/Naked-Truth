<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Can you be saved by faith only? Do works mean anything? The answer is in
  the following verses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Mat 5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
    works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
    <p>John 10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my
    Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
    <p>John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the
    works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do;
    because I go unto my Father.
    <p>Acts 9:36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which
    by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and
    almsdeeds which she did.
    <p>Gal 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but
    by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we
    might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law:
    for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
    <p>Eph 2:8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
    yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>
    Eph 2:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br>
    Eph 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
    works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
    <p>1 Tim 2:9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest
    apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold,
    or pearls, or costly array;<br>
    1 Tim 2:10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
    <p>1 Tim 6:17 Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
    highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth
    us richly all things to enjoy;<br>
    1 Tim 6:18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
    distribute, willing to communicate;<br>
    1 Tim 6:19 Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the
    time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
    <p>2 Tim 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
    profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
    righteousness:<br>
    2 Tim 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all
    good works.<br>
    2 Tim 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who
    shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;<br>
    2 Tim 4:2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
    rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.<br>
    2 Tim 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
    but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
    itching ears;<br>
    2 Tim 4:4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
    turned unto fables.<br>
    2 Tim 4:5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of
    an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.<br>
    2 Tim 4:6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
    at hand.
    <p>Titus 1:16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
    being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br>
    Titus 2:1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
    <p>Titus 2:7 In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works: in
    doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,<br>
    Titus 2:8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
    contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
    <p>Titus 2:14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
    iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.<br>
    Titus 2:15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
    Let no man despise thee.
    <p>Titus 3:8 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
    affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to
    maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
    <p>Titus 3:14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary
    uses, that they be not unfruitful.
    <p>James 2:14 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
    faith, and have not works? can faith save him?<br>
    James 2:15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br>
    James 2:16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
    filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to
    the body; what doth it profit?<br>
    James 2:17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.<br>
    James 2:18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me
    thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.<br>
    James 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils
    also believe, and tremble.<br>
    James 2:20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?<br>
    James 2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
    offered Isaac his son upon the altar?<br>
    James 2:22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was
    faith made perfect?<br>
    James 2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
    God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the
    Friend of God.<br>
    James 2:24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
    faith only.<br>
    James 2:25 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when
    she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?<br>
    James 2:26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
    works is dead also.
    <p>Mat 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
    prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy
    name done many wonderful works?<br>
    Mat 7:23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from
    me, ye that work iniquity.
    <p>Mat 12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
    tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.<br>
    Mat 12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?
    for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.<br>
    Mat 12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
    good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil
    things.<br>
    Mat 12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
    they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.<br>
    Mat 12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
    shalt be condemned.
    <p>Luke 13:6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree
    planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found
    none.<br>
    Luke 13:7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three
    years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why
    cumbereth it the ground?<br>
    Luke 13:8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also,
    till I shall dig about it, and dung it:<br>
    Luke 13:9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt
    cut it down.
    <p>Rev 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
    every man according as his work shall be.
  </blockquote>
  So just as by it's fruit, the tree is known, your faith <em>is demonstrated </em>by
  your good works, yet, you will <em>not be saved by your works</em>, but rather
  by your faith in Jesus Christ. Read the parable of the talents starting in Mat
  25:14. Substitute for the talent a knowledge of salvation through Jesus
  (faith). If you keep this knowledge to yourself, you have buried the talent
  (your faith), and wasted what God has given you. You must share this faith
  with others, that they may also believe. Then you will multiply the talent
  (faith) God has given you. This is the kind of good works that must follow
  faith. Many may claim faith, but do they live it? If they do not, God will
  deny knowing them.
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
    shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
