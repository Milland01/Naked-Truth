  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven 
  and the earth.&quot; Gen.1:1 &quot;And God blessed the seventh day, and rested from all 
  his work.&quot; 2:3 </p>

  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;REMEMBER the Sabbath day to keep it 
  holy.&quot; &quot;Six days work may be done, but the seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord 
  thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.&quot; This commandment I conceive to be 
  as binding now as it ever was, and will be to the entering into the &quot;gates of 
  the city.&quot; Rev.22:14 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the SEVENTH day 
  Sabbath is not the LEAST one, among the ALL things that are to be restored 
  before the second advent of Jesus Christ, seeing that the Imperial and Papal 
  power of Rome, since the days of the Apostles, have changed the seventh day 
  Sabbath to the first day of the week! </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty days before God re-enacted and 
  wrote the commandments with his finger on tables of stone, he required his 
  people to keep the Sabbath. Exo.6:27,30 Here he calls the Sabbath &quot;MY 
  COMMANDMENTS AND MY LAWS.&quot; NOW the SAVIOR has given his comments on the 
  commandments. See Matt.22:35,40 &quot;On these two (precepts) hang ALL the law and 
  the prophets.&quot; Then it would be impossible for the Sabbath to be left out. A 
  question was asked, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Says Jesus, &quot;If 
  thou wilt enter into life keep the </font>commandments&quot; -Matt.19:17 Here he 
  quotes five from the tables of stone. It is still clearer in Luke 10.25,28 
  &quot;What is written in the law? how readest thou?&quot; Here he gives the Saviour's 
  exposition in 22 Matt. as above. Jesus says, &quot;Thou hast answered right, this 
  do and live.&quot; See also Matt.5:17,19,21,27,33 PAUL comments thus. &quot;The law is 
  holy, and the commandments holy, just and good.&quot; &quot;Circumcision and 
  uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping the commandments of God.&quot; &quot;All the 
  law is fulfilled in one word: thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; JOHN 
  says, &quot;the old commandment is the WORD from the beginning.&quot; - 2,7 - Gen.2:3 
  &quot;He carries us from thence into the gates of the city.&quot; Rev.22:14 Here he has 
  particular reference to the Sabbath. JAMES calls it the PERFECT, royal law of 
  liberty, which we are to be doers of, and be judged by. Take out the fourth 
  commandment and the law is imperfect, and we shall fail in one point. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uncompromising advocate for present 
  truth, which feeds and nourishes the little flock in whatever country or 
  place, is the restorer of all things; one man like John the Baptist, cannot 
  discharge this duty to every kindred, nation, tongue and people, and still 
  remain in one place. The truth is what we want. </p>

  <p ALIGN="center"><b>PREFACE </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="center">TO THE LITTLE FLOCK. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My reasons for issuing a second edition 
  of this book are, First, the increasing demand for them, from different 
  quarters. Second, it affords me an opportunity of spreading additional light 
  from the Word on this important subject of present truth. Much more is said 
  about it than any doctrine in the Bible, beginning in Genesis, and continuing 
  down to the closing up of the last message which God ever gave to man, proving 
  clearly that the doing of these commandments saves the soul; showing it more 
  clearly than a strict adherence to the Constitution of these United States 
  proves the man a sound patriot. Therefore in this sense United States proves 
  the man a sound patriot. Therefore in this sense they are strictly the 
  constitution of the Bible, the everlasting covenant between God and man, and 
  can never be changed or altered while man is stamped with the image of God. 
  Why then has the church lost sight of them? or rather the Covenant in them of 
  the 7th day Sabbath? See history 43d page, and Dan.7.25 Well then how does it 
  come to be understood at this point of time? Answer. - The angel Gabriel told 
  Daniel that knowledge should increase in the time of the end. This of course 
  included the scriptures, particularly since the proclamation of the 
  everlasting Gospel of Rev.14:6,13. It is well known how this knowledge has 
  increased since 1840. These ten Commandments being the foundation of the 
  scriptures. (See Matt.22.) God, in a peculiar manner, to instruct his honest, 
  confiding children, shows them spiritually under the sounding of the seventh 
  Angel, the ark of his testament after the temple of God was opened in 
  heaven.Rev.11:10 These are the ten commandments. Here then I understand is 
  where the spirit made an indelible impression to search the scriptures for the 
  TESTIMONY of God. It was done, and published to the world by many, that the 
  professed church had been walking in open violation of the fourth commandment 
  since the days of the Apostles. - Every one that has read the history of this 
  TESTIMONY of God in the Ark, must see the mighty power that accompanied it 
  through Israel and Philistine, one of the greatest wonders that ever existed 
  in this world, a pattern only of what was seen in the opening of the Temple in 
  heaven. In Rev.14:12, John sees them obeying its dictates. In the xv ch. he 
  describes the division as in the 14th ch. they were rejoicing over the victory 
  of the beast, (got out of the churches,) standing on or by the sure word of 
  prophecy, (some say immortality.) The 4th v. says, &quot;for all nations SHALL come 
  (in the future) and worship before thee.&quot; After that I looked and behold the 
  Temple of the Tabernacle of the TESTIMONY in heaven was open,&quot; 5th v. (that is 
  after their songs of rejoicing.) The Temple which contained the Tabernacle, 
  the ark of the testimony, or ten commandments was open. Now this Temple 
  without doubt is the new Jerusalem. Who cannot see that this Temple has been 
  opened for some purpose, but not to be entered by man until the seven last 
  plagues are fulfilled. Here is a space of time in which the commandments will 
  be fully kept. I do not say that this view of the Ark in Rev. is positive, but 
  I think the inference is strong. I cannot see what else it refers to. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On pages 15,16, I have added about 24 
  lines in further explanation of Col.2:14,17 On 16th page, I have also added 
  about as much more to illustrate and distinguish the Sabbath feasts of the 
  Jewish nation. On the nineteenth page I have given about forty lines on the 2d 
  Cor.3, which I think must settle these points fully. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last fourteen pages are principally 
  devoted to the covenants and what they are intended for. The two covenants 
  made with man in this state of mortality, is first by God delivered to Moses. 
  The second or new, by Jesus Christ and his disciples. Paul in speaking of them 
  to the Gal.4:24, says these are THE TWO COVENANTS. All the others belong to 
  the Saints after the second advent. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of the brethren feel it a duty to 
  help pay for the paper and printing of this edition the way is open, otherwise 
  it will be done by a few individuals here, as was the first edition. This work 
  is sent forth gratuitously, with a fervent prayer that these present precious 
  truths may be set home on the soul preparatory to the coming judgment. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since issuing the first edition in 
  August last, we have publicly called on all the advent lecturers and believers 
  to show us if we were wrong on the Lord's Sabbath. Once more we now challenge 
  the Christian world to show us if they can from the Bible, where we have taken 
  a wrong view of the seventh day Sabbath. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairhaven, Jan. 1847. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J.B. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>THE SABBATH </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>FIRST QUESTION IS, WHEN WAS THE SABBATH INSTITUTED? </b>
  </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THOSE who are in the habit of reading 
  the Scriptures just as they find them, and of understanding them according to 
  the established rules of interpretation, will never be at a loss to understand 
  so plain a passage as the following: &quot;And God blessed the seventh day, and 
  sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which God 
  created and made.&quot; Gen.2:3 Moses, when referring to it, says to the children 
  of Israel, &quot;This is that which the Lord hath said, to-morrow is the REST of 
  the holy Sabbath unto the Lord.&quot; Exod.16:23 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we understand that God established 
  the seventh day Sabbath in Paradise, on the very day when he rested from all 
  his work, and not one week, nor one year, not two thousand five hundred and 
  fourteen years afterwards, as some would have it. Is it not plain that the 
  Sabbath was instituted to commemorate the stupendous work of creation, and 
  designed by God to be celebrated by his worshipers as a weekly Sabbath, in the 
  same manner as the Israelites were commanded to celebrate the Passover, from 
  the very night of their deliverance till the resurrection of Jesus from the 
  dead; or as we, as a nation, annually celebrate our national independence; or 
  as type answers to antitype, so we believe this must run down, to the &quot;keeping 
  of the Sabbath to the people of God&quot; in the immortal state. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is argued by some, that because no 
  mention is made of the Sabbath from its institution in Paradise till the 
  falling of the manna in the wilderness, mentioned in Exo.16:15, that it was 
  therefore here instituted for the Jews, but we think there is Bible argument 
  sufficient to sustain the reply of Jesus to the Pharisees, &quot;that the Sabbath 
  was made for MAN and not man for the Sabbath.&quot; If it was made for any one 
  exclusively it must have been for Adam, the father of us all, two thousand 
  years before Abraham (who is claimed as the father of the Jews) was born. John 
  says, the old commandment was from the beginning -1John2:7 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is pretty strong inference that 
  the antediluvians measured time by weeks from the account given by Noah, when 
  the waters of the deluge began to subside. He &quot;sent out a dove which soon 
  returned.&quot; At the end of seven days he sent her out again; and at the end of 
  seven days more, he sent her out a third time. Now why this preference for the 
  number seven? why not five or ten days, or any other number? Can it be 
  supposed that his fixing on upon seven was accidental? How much more natural 
  to conclude that it was in obedience to the authority of God, as expressed in 
  the 2d chap. of Gen. A similar division of time is incidentally mentioned in 
  Gen.29: fulfill her week and we will give thee this also; and Jacob did so and 
  fulfilled her week.&quot; Now the word week is every where used in Scriptures as we 
  use it; it never means more nor less than seven days (except as symbols of 
  years) and one of them was in all other cases the Sabbath. But now suppose 
  there had been an entire silence on the subject of the Sabbath for this 
  twenty-five hundred years, would that be sufficient evidence that there was 
  none. If so, we have the same evidence that there was no Sabbath from the 
  reign of Joshua till the reign of David, four hundred and six years, as no 
  mention is made of it in the history of that period. But who can be persuaded 
  that Samuel and the pious Judges of Israel did not regard the Sabbath. What 
  does God say of Abraham? that he &quot;obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my 
  commandments, my statutes and my laws. (See what he calls them in 
  Exo.16:27,30) This, of course, includes the whole. Then Abraham reverenced 
  God's Sabbath. Once more, there is no mention of the circumcision from the 
  days of Joshua till the days of Jeremiah, a period of more than eight hundred 
  years. Will it be believed that Samuel and David, and all those pious worthies 
  with the whole Jewish nation, neglected that essential seal of the covenant 
  for eight hundred years? It cannot be admitted for a moment. How then can any 
  one suppose from the alleged silence of the sacred history that Adam, Enoch, 
  Noah and Abraham, kept no Sabbath, because the fact was not stated? If we turn 
  to Jer.9:25,26, we find that they had not neglected this rite of circumcision, 
  only they had not circumcised their hearts; so that the proof is clear, that 
  silence respecting the keeping any positive command of God, is no evidence 
  that it is not in full force. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, if the Sabbath was not instituted 
  in Paradise, why did Moses mention it in connection with the creation of the 
  world? Why not reserve this fact for two or three thousand years in his 
  history, until the manna fell in the wilderness, (see Exo.16:23) and then 
  state that the seventh day Sabbath commenced, as some will have it? I answer, 
  for the very best of reasons, that it did not commence there. Let us examine 
  the text. &quot;And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as 
  much bread as on any preceding day, and all the rulers of the congregation 
  came and told Moses. And he said unto them this is that which the Lord hath 
  said, to-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath. bake that which ye will bake, 
  &amp;c.&amp;c.&quot; If this had been the establishing of the holy Sabbath and Moses had 
  said to-morrow shall be the Sabbath, then would it have been clear; but no, he 
  speaks as familiarly about it as we do when we say that to-morrow is the 
  Sabbath, showing conclusively that it was known before, or how could the 
  people have known that they must gather two day's manna on Friday the sixth 
  day, unless they had had some previous knowledge of the Sabbath? for Moses had 
  already taught them not to &quot;leave any of it until the morning&quot; -v.19 The 20th 
  verse shows that the Sabbath had not yet come since their receiving the manna, 
  because it spoiled and &quot;bred worms by the next morning;&quot; whereas, on the 
  Sabbath morning it was found sweet and eatable -24th v. This was the thirtieth 
  day after leaving Egypt (1st v.) and twenty days before it was given on Sinai. 
  The weekly Sabbath then was appointed before this or before the days of Moses. 
  Where was it then? Answer, in the second chapter of Genesis and no where else; 
  and the same week on which the manna fell, the weekly Sabbath was revived 
  among or with God's chosen people. Grotius tells us &quot;that the memory of the 
  creation's being performed in seven days, was preserved not only among the 
  Greeks and Italians, but among the Celts and Indians.&quot; Other writers say 
  Assyrians, Egyptians, Arabians, Britons and Germans, all of whom divide their 
  time into weeks. Philo says &quot;the Sabbath is not peculiar to any one people or 
  country, but is common to all the world.&quot; Josephus states &quot;that there is no 
  city either of Greeks or barbarians or any other nation, where the religion of 
  the Sabbath is not known.&quot; But as they, like the great mass of God's professed 
  people in Christendom, paid little or no heed to what God had said about the 
  particular day, (except the Jews, and a few others) they (as we are informed 
  in history) adopted peculiar days to suit themselves, viz: the Christian 
  nations chose to obey the Pope of Rome, who changed the seventh day Sabbath to 
  the first day, and call it the holy Sabbath; the Persians selected Monday; the 
  Grecians Tuesday; the Assyrians Wednesday; the Egyptians Thursday; the Turks 
  Friday, and the Jews the seventh day, Saturday, as God had commanded. Three 
  standing miracles a week, for about forty years annually, ought to perpetuate 
  the Sabbath. 1st, double the quantity of manna on the sixth day; 2d, none on 
  the seventh; 3d, did not spoil on the seventh day. If it does not matter which 
  day you keep holy to the Lord, then all these nations are right. Now reflect 
  one moment on this, and then open your Bible and read the commandment of the 
  God of all these nations! &quot;REMEMBER! (what you have been taught before) the 
  Sabbath day to keep it holy;&quot; (which day is it Lord?) &quot;The SEVENTH is the 
  Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou not thy 
  son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, 
  nor thy stranger, that is within thy gates.&quot; Who is the stranger? (Gentiles.) 
  Now the reason for it will carry us back again to Paradise. &quot;For in six days 
  the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested 
  on the SEVENTH; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.&quot; 
  &quot;Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the 
  Sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant; it is a SIGN 
  between me and the children of Israel forever. (Why is it Lord?) &quot;For in six 
  days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the SEVENTH day he rested and was 
  refreshed.&quot; Exo.20 and 21 Which day now will you choose? O, says the reader, 
  the seventh if I knew which of the days it was. If you don't know, why are you 
  so sure that the first day is right? O, because the history of the world has 
  settled that, and this is the most we can know. Very well then, does not the 
  seventh come the day before the eighth? If we have not got the days of the 
  week right now, it is not likely that we ever shall. God does not require of 
  us any more than what we know; by that we shall be judged. Luke 23:55,56. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more: think you that the spirit of 
  God ever directed Moses when he was giving the history of the creation of the 
  world, to write that he (God) &quot;blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, 
  because that in it he had rested from all his work,&quot; unless he meant it to be 
  dated from that very day? Why, this is as clear to the unbiased mind as it is 
  that God created man the sixth day. Would it not be the height of absurdity to 
  attempt to prove that God only intended Adam should be created at some future 
  period, or that the creation of the heavens and earth was not in the 
  beginning, but some twenty-five hundred years afterward? All this would be as 
  cogent reasoning as it would be to argue that God did not intend this day of 
  rest should commence until about twenty-five hundred years afterwards. (The 
  word Sabbath signifies rest.) </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows then irresistibly, that the 
  weekly Sabbath was not made for the Jews only, (but as Jesus says, for `man') 
  for the Jews had no existence until more than two thousand years after it was 
  established. President Humphrey in his essays on the Sabbath says, &quot;That he 
  (God) instituted it when he rested from all his work, on the seventh day of 
  the first week, and gave it primarily to our first parents, and through them 
  to all their posterity; that the observance of it was enjoined upon the 
  children of Israel soon after they left Egypt, not in the form of a new 
  enactment, but as an ancient institution which was far from being forgotten, 
  though it had doubtless been greatly neglected under the cruel domination of 
  their heathen masters; that it was re-enacted with great pomp and solemnity, 
  and written in stone by the finger of God at Sinai; that the sacred 
  institution then took the form of a statute, with explicit prohibitions and 
  requirements, and has never been repealed or altered since; that it can never 
  expire of itself, because it has no limitation.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Deut.7:6-8, God gives his reasons for 
  selecting the Jews to keep his covenant in preference to any other nation; 
  only seventy at first -10:22 God calls it his &quot;Sabbath,&quot; and refers us right 
  back to the creation for proof. &quot;For in six days the Lord made heaven and 
  earth and sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh,&quot; &amp;c. Here 
  then we stand fixed by the immutable law of God, and the word of Jesus, that 
  &quot;the Sabbath was made for man!&quot; Paul says, &quot;there is no respect of persons 
  with God.&quot; Rom.2:11 Isaiah shows us plainly that the Jew is not the only one 
  to be blessed for keeping the Sabbath. He says &quot;Blessed is the man (are not 
  the Gentiles men) that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it.&quot; &quot;Also the sons 
  of the stranger, (who are these if they are not Gentiles?) every one that 
  keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, (does he mean me? yes, every Gentile in 
  the universe, or else he respects persons) even them will I bring to my holy 
  mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer; for my house shall be 
  called an house of prayer for all people.&quot; Isa.56:2,6,7 If this promise is not 
  to the Gentile as well as the Jew, then &quot;the house of prayer for all people.&quot; 
  is no promise to the Gentile. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we ask, if God has ever abrogated 
  the law of the Sabbath? If he has it can easily be found. We undertake to say 
  without fear of contradiction, he has not made any such record in the Bible; 
  but to the contrary, he calls it a perpetual covenant, a &quot;sign between me and 
  the children of Israel forever,&quot; for the reason that he rested on the seventh 
  day. Exo.31:16,17 Says one, has not the ceremonial law been annulled and 
  nailed to the cross? Yes, but what of that? Why then the Sabbath must be 
  abolished, for Paul to say that the seventh day Sabbath was made void or 
  nailed to the cross at the crucifixion, when he never intended any such 
  change; if he did, he certainly would have deceived the inhabitants of 
  Jerusalem, in the promise which he made them about two thousand four hundred 
  and forty-six years ago! Turn now to Jer.27:25, and tell me if he did not 
  promise the inhabitants of Jerusalem that their city should remain forever if 
  they would hallow the Sabbath day. Now suppose the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
  had entered into this agreement, and entailed it upon their posterity (because 
  you see it could not have been fulfilled unless it had continued from 
  generation to generation,) to keep the Sabbath holy, would not God have been 
  bound to let Jerusalem remain forever? You say yes. Well, then, I ask you to 
  show how he could have kept that promise inviolate if he intended in less than 
  six hundred and fifty years to change this seventh day Sabbath, and call the 
  first day of the week the Sabbath, or abolish it altogether? I say, therefore, 
  if there has been any change one way or the other in the Sabbath, since that 
  promise, it would be impossible to understand any other promise in the Bible; 
  how much more reasonable to believe God than man. If men will allow themselves 
  to believe the monstrous absurdity that FOREVER, as in this promise, ended at 
  the resurrection, then they can easily believe that the Sabbath was changed 
  from the seventh to the first day of the week. Or if they choose the other 
  extreme, abolished until the people of God should awake to be clothed on with 
  immortality. Heb.4:9 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now does it not appear plain that the 
  Sabbath is from God, and that it is coeval and co-extensive (as is the 
  institution of marriage) with the world. That it is without limitation; that 
  there is not one thus saith the Lord that it ever was or ever will be 
  abolished, in time or eternity. See Exod.31:16,17; and Isa.66:22,24; Heb.4:4,9 
  But let us return and look at the subject as we have commenced in the light of 
  Paul's argument to the Romans and Colossians, for here is where all writers on 
  this subject, for the change or the overthrow of the seventh day Sabbath 
  attempt to draw their strong arguments. The second question then, is this: </p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="center"><b>HAS THE SABBATH BEEN ABOLISHED SINCE THE SEVENTH DAY OF 
CREATION? <br>
IF SO, WHEN, AND WHERE IS THE PROOF? </b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The text already referred to, is in 
  Rom.14:5,6 &quot;One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every 
  day alike. Let every man be persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the 
  day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day to the 
  Lord, he doth not regard it.&quot; Does the apostle here mean to say, that under 
  the new or Christian dispensation it is a matter of indifference which day of 
  the week is kept as a Sabbath, or whether any Sabbath at all is kept? Was that 
  institution which the people of God had been commanded to call a delight, the 
  holy of the Lord, honorable, now to be esteemed of so carnal a nature as to be 
  ranked among the things which Jesus &quot;took out of the way, nailing it to His 
  cross.&quot; If this be true, then has Jesus, in the same manner, abolished the 
  eight last verses in the fifty-eighth of Isaiah, and the 2d, 6th and 7th 
  verses of the 56th chapter have no reference to the Gentile since the 
  crucifixion. O Lord help us rightly to understand and divide thy word. But is 
  it not evident from the four first verses in the same chapter of Romans, that 
  Paul is speaking of feast days; Hear him explain. &quot;Destroy not him with thy 
  meal for whom Christ died. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink.&quot; 
  15,17v, also 20,23 Giving them again in substance the decrees which had been 
  given by the Apostles in their first conference, in A.D. 51, held at 
  Jerusalem. See Acts 15:19 James proposes their letter to the Gentiles should 
  be &quot;that they abstain from pollution of Idols, and from fornication, and from 
  things strangled, and from blood;&quot; to which the conference all agreed. Now 
  please read their unanimous decrees (16:4,) from twenty-three to thirty 
  verses. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay upon you no 
  greater burden than these necessary things.&quot; &quot;That ye abstain from meats 
  offered to Idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from 
  fornication, from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well.&quot; Reading along 
  to the 13th of the next chapter, we find Paul establishing the Churches with 
  these decrees; (see 4,5,) and at Philippi he holds his meeting, (not in the 
  Jews Synagogue) but at the river's side, on the Sabbath day. A little from 
  this it is said that Paul is in Thessalonica preaching on the Sabbath days. 
  Luke says this was his manner! What was it? Why, to preach on the Sabbath 
  days, (not 1st days.) Observe here was three Sabbaths in succession. 17:2 A 
  little while from this Paul locates himself in Corinth, and there preaches to 
  the Jews and Greeks (or Gentiles) a year and six months every Sabbath. Now 
  this must have been seventy-eight in succession. 18:4,11 Does this look like 
  abolishing the Sabbath day? Has anything been said about the 1st day yet? No, 
  we shall speak of that by and by. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this he was in Antioch. &quot;And when 
  the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the GENTILES besought that these words 
  might be preached to them the next Sabbath. And the next Sabbath day came 
  almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.&quot; 13:42,44 Here is 
  proof that the Gentiles kept the Sabbath. Now I wish to place the other strong 
  text which is so strangely adhered to for abolishing or changing this Sabbath 
  along side of this, that we may understand his meaning. &quot;Blotting out the 
  hand-writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and 
  took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, 
  or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the 
  Sabbath days.&quot; Col.2:14,16 Now here is one of the strong arguments adhered to 
  by all those who say the seventh day Sabbath was abolished at the crucifixion 
  of our Lord; while on the other hand by the great mass of the Christian world, 
  (so called,) the seventh day Sabbath ceased here, and in less than forty-eight 
  hours the change was made to the first day of the week. Now remember Paul's 
  manner, (before stated) itinerating from city to city and nation to nation, 
  always preaching to Jews and Gentiles on the seventh day Sabbath, (for there 
  is no other day called the Lord's Sabbath in the Bible.) Now if the Apostle 
  did mean to include the Sabbath of the Lord God with the Jewish feasts and 
  Sabbaths in the text, then the course he took to do so, was the strangest 
  imaginable. His manner always was, as recorded, with the exception of one 
  night, to preach on the very day that he was laboring to abolish. If you will 
  look at the date in your Bibles, you will learn this same apostle had been 
  laboring in this way as a special messenger to the Gentiles, between twenty 
  and thirty years since (as you say) the Sabbath was changed or abolished, and 
  yet never uttered one word with respect to any other day in the week to be set 
  apart as a holy day or Sabbath. I understand all the arguments about his 
  laboring in the Jewish Synagogue on their Sabbath, because they were open for 
  worship on that day, &amp;c., but he did not always preach in their Synagogues. He 
  says that he preached the Kingdom of God, and labored in his own hired house 
  for two years. He also established a daily meeting for disputation in the 
  school of Tyranus.&quot; Acts 19:9 Again he says, I have &quot;kept back NOTHING that 
  was PROFITABLE unto you. (Now if the Sabbath had been changed or abolished, 
  would it not have been profitable to have told them so?) and have taught you 
  publicly, and from house to house.&quot; &quot;For I have not shunned to declare unto 
  you ALL the council of God.&quot; - Acts 20:20,27 Then it is clear that he taught 
  them by example that the Sabbath of the Lord God was not abolished. Luke says 
  it was the custom (or manner) of Christ to teach in the synagogues on the 
  Sabbath day. 4:16,31 Mark says, &quot;And when the Sabbath day was come he began to 
  teach in their synagogue.&quot; Mark 6:2 Now if Jesus was about to abolish or 
  change this Sabbath, (which belonged to the first code, the moral law, and not 
  the ceremonial, the second code, which was to be nailed to his cross, or 
  rather, as said the angel Gabriel to Daniel, 9:27, &quot;he (Christ) in the midst 
  of the week shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease,&quot; meaning that the 
  Jewish sacrifices and offerings would cease at his death.) Jesus did not 
  attend to any of the ceremonies of the Jews except the passover and the feasts 
  of tabernacles. Why did he say, &quot;Think not I am come to destroy the law or the 
  prophets? I am not come to destroy but fulfill. One jot or one title shall in 
  no wise pass from the law until all be fulfilled.&quot; &quot;Whosoever therefore shall 
  break one of these least commandments&quot; &amp;c. Did he mean the ten commandments? 
  Yes; for he immediately points out the third, not to take God's name in vain; 
  sixth and seventh, not to kill nor to commit adultery, and styles them the 
  least. Then the others, which include the fourth, of course were greater than 
  these. Matt.5:17-19,21,27,33, and were not to be broken nor pass away. Then 
  the Sabbath stands unchanged. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost every writer which I have read on 
  the subject of abolishing or changing the seventh day Sabbath, call it the 
  Jewish Sabbath, hence their difficulty. How can it be the Jewish Sabbath when 
  it was established two thousand years before there was a Jew on the face of 
  the earth, and certainly twenty-five hundred before it was embodied in the 
  decalogue, or re-enacted and written in stone by the finger of God at Sinai. 
  God called this HIS Sabbath, and Jesus says it was made for man, (not 
  particularly for the Jews.) </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Well,&quot; says one, &quot;what is the meaning 
  of the texts which you have quoted, where it speaks of Sabbaths?&quot; - Answer: 
  These are the Jewish Sabbaths! which belong to them as a nation and are 
  connected with their feasts. God by Hosea makes this distinction, and says, &quot;I 
  will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons and her 
  Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.&quot; These then belong to the text quoted, 
  and not God's Sabbath. Do you ask for the proof? See 23 Levit.4 &quot;These are the 
  FEASTS of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons, EVERY THING UPON 
  HIS DAY&quot; -37th v. (May we not deviate a little? If you do it will be at your 
  peril.) Fifteenth and sixteenth verses gives them a fifty day's Sabbath; 
  twenty-fourth verse says: &quot;Speak unto the children of Israel, saying in the 
  seventh month in the first day of the month, shall ye have a Sabbath, a 
  memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Also on the tenth day of the seventh 
  month there shall be a day of atonement. It shall be unto you a Sabbath of 
  rest.&quot; 27,32 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Also on the fifteenth day of the 
  seventh month when ye shall have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall 
  keep a feast unto the Lord seven days. On the first shall be a Sabbath, and on 
  the eighth day shall be a Sabbath. 39v. And Moses declared unto the children 
  of Israel the FEASTS of the Lord.&quot; 44v. Now here we have FOUR kinds of Jewish 
  Sabbaths, also called &quot;FEASTS of the Lord,&quot; to be kept annually. The first 
  fifty days or seven weeks Sabbath ends the third month, seventh. In three 
  months and twenty-four days more commences the second Sabbath, seventh month, 
  first; the next, the tenth; the last the fifteenth of the month. Between the 
  first two Sabbaths there is an interval of one hundred and twelve days; the 
  next two, ten days, and the next, five days. Now it can be seen at a glance, 
  that neither of these Sabbaths could be on the seventh day any oftener than 
  other annual feast could come on that day. These then are what Hosea calls HER 
  Sabbaths. Paul calls them HOLY DAYS, new moons, and Sabbaths; and this is what 
  they are stated to be. The first day of the seventh month is a new moon 
  SABBATH, the tenth is a Sabbath of rest and Holy convocation, a day of 
  atonement, and the fifteenth a feast of Sabbaths. Do you ask for any more 
  evidence that these are the Jewish Sabbaths, and that God's Sabbath is 
  separate from them? Read then what God directed Moses to write in the third 
  verse: &quot;Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of 
  rest, an holy convocation, ye shall do no work therein, it is the Sabbath of 
  the LORD in all your dwellings.&quot; Now Moses has here declared from the mouth of 
  the Lord, that these are ALL the feast of the Lord, (there is no more nor 
  less) and every thing is to be upon his day, and he has clearly and definitely 
  separated his Sabbath from the other four. But let us look at the text again. 
  Col.2:14 - 16 See 17 (?) &quot;which are a shadow of things to come.&quot; What did the 
  apostle say were shadows? Why, meat, drink, holy day, new moon, sabbath days. 
  16th v. Heb.9:10 What does he mean by shadow? See Heb.10:1,2 Just what I have 
  stated on page 14. Now here we have one clear, positive point. If the seventh 
  day Sabbath is included in the 17th verse, then it must be a shadow; if it is 
  not a shadow, then Paul has no reference to it, and it stands forever! Moses 
  says the ten commandments were written by the finger of God on tables of 
  stone; whatever God has done with his own hand is stamped with immortality, 
  and is as enduring as the sun, moon and stars. Ps.8:3 But if the 4th 
  commandment, the Sabbath of the Lord is a shadow then all the other nine 
  commandments must be. Let us look at what are called by our Lord the least 
  commandments, the 6th and 7th &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot; - &quot;Thou shalt not commit 
  adultery.&quot; Math.5:19,21,27 Are these shadows? Is there an individual with 
  common sense in the world that dare risk his reputation in such kind of logic? 
  Then it is as clear as a sun beam that all the others are tangible substances, 
  and will continue in full force while immortality endures; especially the 4th 
  commandment, the Sabbath. See Isa.66:23, Heb.4:9 Rev.22:14 And in the 28th and 
  29th chapters of Numbers the sacrifices and offerings for each of these days 
  are made so plain, beginning with the Sabbath, 9v, that we have only to read 
  the following to understand. 26.29:1 First day, seventh month, (new moon;) 7v, 
  10th day Sabbath; 12th v., 15th day Sabbath, and 35th v., 23d Sabbath. I will 
  endeavor to present it in a clearer point of view: </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feast by fire connected with the Lord's 
  and the Jewish Sabbaths. The Daily or continual [always] 2 lambs morning and 
  evenings, 3 quarts of flour for a meat offering, 2 1-2 pints of oil, 5 pints 
  of wine - 28:3 - 7 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE SABBATH DAY. 2 lambs, and six quarts 
  of flour with oil. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here follow the Jewish feasts with their 
  Sabbaths: </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st - 7th week Sabbath, 2 bullocks, 1 
  ram, 7 lambs, 1 goat, 24 quarts of flour - 28:16,17 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 7th month Sabbath, 1 bullock, 1 ram, 7 
  lambs, 1 kid, 36 quarts of flour - 29:1 - 5 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3d - 10th of 7th month Sabbath, 1 
  bullock, 1 ram, 7 lambs, 2 kids, 86 quarts of flour - 7 - 11 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th - 13 of 7th month Sabbath, 13 
  bullocks, 2 rams, 14 lambs, 2 kids, 4 1-2 bushels of flour - 12 - 16 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8th day Sabbath, 1 bullock, 1 ram, 7 
  lambs, 1 goat, 36 quarts of flour - 35 - 39 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And Moses told the children of Israel 
  according to all that the Lord commanded Moses.&quot; Here is the 8th day Sabbath, 
  which makes 5 Jewish Sabbaths, every one of them differing from the other and 
  the Lord's Sabbath, no more connected with them than in the xxiii of Levit. 
  just named. Here then is an unanswerable argument for a separation of the 
  Jewish from the Lord's Sabbath, and shows conclusively what Paul calls 
  &quot;shadows&quot; in Col:17, and Hosea &quot;her Sabbaths.&quot; And in the days of Nehemiah 
  when Ezra had read the law to the people, 8 (more than one thousand years 
  after they were promulgated,) they bound themselves under an oath &quot;to walk in 
  God's law which was given by the hand of Moses, the servant of God.&quot; &quot;And to 
  observe and do all the commandments of the Lord, our Lord.&quot; 10:29 And that 
  there might be no misunderstanding about the kind of Sabbaths, they say, &quot;If 
  the people bring ware or any victuals on the Sabbath day to sell, that we 
  would not buy it of them on the Sabbath or on the holy day,&quot; (31v.) but they 
  would &quot;charge themselves yearly with a third part of a shekel (to pay for) 
  &quot;the burnt offerings of the Sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set feasts,&quot; 
  &amp;c. (33v.) for the house of God, including what has already been set forth in 
  Leviticus and Numbers. Now as their feast days commenced and ended with a 
  Sabbath, so when their feasts ceased to be binding on them these Sabbaths must 
  also, and all were &quot;nailed to the cross.&quot; Now I ask, if there is one particle 
  of proof that the Sabbath of the Lord is included in these Sabbaths and feast 
  days? Who then dare join them together or contradict the Most High God, and 
  call HIS the Jewish Sabbath. Theirs was nailed to the cross when Jesus died, 
  while the Lord's is an everlasting sign a perpetual covenant. The Jews, as a 
  nation, broke their covenant. Jesus and his disciples were one week (the last 
  of the seventy) that is seven years, confirming the new covenant for another 
  people, the Gentiles. Now I ask if this changing the subjects from Jew to 
  Gentile made void the commandments and law of God, or in other words, 
  abolished the fourth commandment; if so, the other nine are not binding. It 
  cannot be that God ever intended to mislead his subjects. Let us illustrate 
  this. Suppose that the Congress of these United States in their present 
  emergency, should promulgate two separate codes of laws, one to be perpetual, 
  the other temporary, to be abolished when peace was proclaimed between this 
  country and Mexico. The time comes, the temporary laws are abolished; but 
  strange to hear, a large portion of the people are now insisting upon it that 
  because peace is proclaimed that both these codes of laws are forever 
  abolished; while another class are strenuously insisting that it is only the 
  fourth law in the perpetual code that's now abolished, with the temporary and 
  all the rest is still binding. Opposed to all these is a third class, headed 
  by the ministers and scribes of the nation, who are writing and preaching from 
  Maine to Florida, insisting upon it without fear of contradiction, that when 
  peace was proclaimed this fourth law in the perpetual code was to gradually 
  change its date to another day, (while some of them say immediately) and 
  thenceforward become perpetual, and the other code abolished; and yet not one 
  of these are able to show from the proceedings of Congress that the least 
  alteration had ever been made in the perpetual code. Thus, to me, the case 
  stands clear that neither of the laws or ten commandments in the first code, 
  ever has or ever can be annulled or changed while mortality is stamped on man, 
  for the very reason that God's moral law has no limitation. Jesus then brought 
  in a new covenant, which continued the Sabbath by writing his law upon their 
  hearts. Paul says &quot;written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living 
  God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.&quot; 2Cor.3:3 And 
  when writing to the Romans he shows how the Gentiles are a law unto 
  themselves. He says, they &quot;shew the work of the law written in their hearts, 
  their consciences always bearing them witness, and their thoughts the mean 
  while accusing or else excusing one another,&quot; (when will this be Paul) &quot;in the 
  day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my 
  gospel.&quot; 2:15,16 How plain that this is all the change. The Jews by nature had 
  the law given them on tables of stone, while the Gentiles had the law of 
  commandments written on their hearts. Paul tells the Ephesians that it was 
  &quot;the law of commandments contained in ordinances,&quot; (2:15) not on tables that 
  were nailed to the cross. If the ten commandments, first written by the finger 
  of God on stone, and then at the second covenant on fleshy tables of the 
  heart, are shadows, can any one tell where we shall find the substance? We are 
  answered, in Christ. Well, hear Isaiah. He says, &quot;that he (Christ) will 
  magnify the law and make it honorable.&quot; 42:21 Again, I ask, where was the 
  necessity and of what use were the ten commandments written on our hearts, if 
  it was not to render perfect obedience to them. If we do not keep the day God 
  has sanctified, then we break not the least, but one of the greatest of his 
  commandments. Before we leave this part of our subject let us examine 
  2Cor.3:7,9,13,15 I have been told that these verses clearly prove the 
  abolition of the 10 commandments. It is admitted by all our opponents, that 
  the change which they so much insist upon, respecting the commandments, took 
  place at the crucifixion of our Lord. It is clear from 2Col:14 that the 
  hand-writing of ordinances (the law of Moses) was then taken our of our way, 
  and all that was contrary to us, but the 10 commandments were never contrary 
  to us, especially the 4th, the Sabbath, for &quot;it was made for man.&quot; The 2d or 
  Gospel Covenant Paul tells the Hebs. is written upon our hearts. 8:10 This is 
  the same ten commandments; then instead of being taken away or abolished they 
  are still nearer to us. See also 3dv of 2d Cor:3 If Paul was laboring here to 
  show the abolition of the ten commandments in A.D. 60, (look at the top of 
  your Bible for the date) pray tell me if you can what he meant by writing to 
  the Romans the very same year and telling them that &quot;the law was holy, and the 
  commandments holy, just and good.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he meant no other than the Law and 
  Commandments in the decalogue, see 13:8,9 About four years after this he is 
  exhorting the Ephesians to the keeping the 5th commandment. He says it is the 
  &quot;first commandment with promise.&quot; 6:2 The same year that he writes the Romans 
  he dates his 1st Epistle to the Cor. in ch. 7:19, and says circumcision is 
  nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, (what is, Paul?) but the keeping the 
  commandments of God. Now all this was certainly more than twenty-five years 
  after the crucifixion. Is not the proof then positive and forever established 
  that Paul's preaching is right to the point in establishing the commandments 
  of God instead of abolishing them? If I have not made it plain here, I would 
  just say once more, that the Apostle's argument where he refers to the 
  abolition of the law in Rom., Cor., Gal., see 5:14, Eph. and Heb. he always 
  means the carnal commandments of God, as he has shown. See Acts 21:20,21 Here 
  is circumcision, and the customs, the law of Moses, and not one breath about 
  the Sabbath. But if you will trace back to the 17:4,11, you will see that 
  instead of abolishing THE sabbath, Paul had just come from Corinth, where he 
  had been preaching for 78 Sabbaths in succession. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Lord help thy people to see THESE 
  truths and keep thy law! Still, there are many other texts relating to the 
  law, presented by the opposite view, to show that the law respecting the 
  Sabbath is abolished. Let us look at some of them. But it will be necessary in 
  the first place, to make a clear distinction between what is commonly called 
  the </p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>MORAL AND CEREMONIAL LAW. </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bro. S.S. Snow, in writing on this 
  subject about one year ago, in the Jubilee Standard, asks &quot;by what authority 
  this distinction is made.&quot; He says &quot;neither our Lord or his apostles made any 
  such distinction. When speaking of the law they never used the terms moral or 
  ceremonial, but always spake of it as a whole, calling it the law,&quot; and 
  further says, &quot;we must have a thus saith the Lord to satisfy us.&quot; So I say! I 
  have no doubt but thousands have stopped here; indeed, it has been to me the 
  most difficult point to settle in this whole question. Now let us come to it 
  fairly, and we shall see that the old and new testament writers have ever kept 
  up the distinction, although it may in some parts seem to be one code of laws.
  </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the twentieth chapter of Exodus, 
  where the law of the Sabbath was re-enacted, and onward, we find two distinct 
  codes of laws. The first was written on two tables of stone with the finger of 
  God; the second was taken down from his mouth and recorded by the hand of 
  Moses in a book. Paul calls the latter carnal commandments and ordinances, 
  (rites or ceremonies) which come under two heads, religious and political, and 
  are Moses's. The first code is God's. For proof see Exo.16:28,30 &quot;How long 
  refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws: see for that the Lord hath 
  given you the Sabbath; and so the people rested on the Sabbath day.&quot; Also in 
  the book of Leviticus, where the law of ceremonies is given to the levites or 
  priests, Moses closes with these words: &quot;These are the commandments which the 
  Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai; in 
  Heb.7:16,18, called carnal commandments. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, &quot;the Lord said unto Moses, come 
  up to me into the Mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, 
  and a law, and commandments which I have written.&quot; Exo.34:12 Further he calls 
  them the ten commandments-34:28 And Moses puts them &quot;into the ark&quot; - 40:20 Now 
  for the second code of laws. See Deut.31:9,10; and 24:26 &quot;And when Moses had 
  finished writing the law, he commanded them to put this book of the LAW (of 
  ceremonies) in the side of the ark of the covenant, to be read at the end of 
  every seven years.&quot; This is not the song of deliverance by Moses in the 
  forty-fourth verse of the thirty-second chapter. For, eight hundred and 
  sixty-seven years after this, in the reign of Josiah, king of Israel, the high 
  priest found this book in &quot;the Temple,&quot; (2Chron.34:14,15) which moved all 
  Israel. One hundred and seventy-nine years further onward, Ezra was from 
  morning till noon reading out of this book. Neh.8:3; Heb.9:19 Paul's comments.
  </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bro. Snow says in regard to the 
  commandments, &quot;The principles of moral conduct embraced in the law, were 
  binding before the law was given, (meaning that one of course at Mount Sinai) 
  and are binding now; it is immutable and eternal! They are comprehended in one 
  word, LOVE.&quot; If he meant, as we believe he did, to comprehend what Jesus did 
  in the 19 and 22 chap. Matt.37-40, and Paul, and James, and John after him, 
  then we ask how it is possible for him to reject from that code of laws, the 
  only one, the seventh day rest, that was promulgated at the beginning, while 
  at the same time the other nine, that were not written until about three 
  thousand years afterwards, were eternally binding; without doubt, the whole 
  ten commandments are coeval and coextensive with sin. Again, he says, &quot;We 
  readily admit, that if what is called the decalogue or ten commandments be 
  binding on us, we ought to observe the seventh day, for that was appointed by 
  the Lord as the Sabbath day.&quot; Let us see if Jesus and his apostles do not make 
  it binding. First then, the distinction of the two codes by Jesus. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pharisees ask the Saviour why his 
  disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? His answer is, &quot;Why do ye 
  transgress the commandment of God?&quot; and he immediately cites them to the fifth 
  commandment, Matt.15:4 Again, &quot;The law and the prophets were until John; since 
  that time the kingdom of God is preached,&quot; &amp;c. - Luke 16:16 Jesus was three 
  years after this introducing the gospel of the kingdom, unwaveringly holding 
  his meetings on the Sabbath days, (which our opponents say were now about to 
  be abolished; others say changed,) and never uttering a syllable to show to 
  the contrary, but this was and always would be the holy day for worship. Mark 
  says when the Sabbath (the Seventh day, for there was no other,) was come, he 
  began to teach in the Synagogue, 6:2 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luke says, &quot;as his custom was, he went 
  into the Synagogue and taught on the Sabbath day.&quot; 4:16,31 Will it be said of 
  him as it is of Paul on like occasions, some thirty years afterwards, that he 
  uniformly held his meetings on the Sabbath, because he had no where else to 
  preach, or that this day was the only one in the week in which the people 
  would come out to hear him? Every Bible reader knows better; witness the five 
  thousand and the seven thousand, and the multitudes that thronged him in the 
  streets, in the cities and towns where they listened to him; besides, he was 
  now establishing a new dispensation, while theirs was passing away. Then he 
  did not follow any of their customs or rites or ceremonies which he had come 
  to abolish. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have already quoted Matt.5:17,18, 
  where Jesus said he had come to fulfill the law, and immediately begins by 
  showing them that they are not to violate one of the least of the 
  commandments, and cites them to some - see 6:19,21,27,33 Again, he is 
  tauntingly asked &quot;which is the great commandment in the law: Jesus said unto 
  him, thou shalt love the Lord they God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
  soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the 
  second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two 
  commandments hang all the law and the prophets.&quot; 22:36,40 Here Jesus has 
  divided the ten commandments into two parts, or as it is written on two tables 
  of stone. The first four on the first table treat of those duties which we owe 
  to God - the other six refers to those which we owe to man, requiring perfect 
  obedience. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more, &quot;One came and said unto him, 
  good master what good thing shalt I do that I may have eternal life? He said, 
  I thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments. Then he asked him which? He 
  cited him to the last part of what he called the second, loving his neighbor 
  as himself.&quot; If he had cited him to the first table, as in the 22, quoted 
  above, he could not have replied &quot;all these have I kept from my youth up.&quot; 
  Why? Because he would have already been perfect, for Jesus in reply to his 
  question, what he should do to inherit eternal life, said he must &quot;keep the 
  commandments.&quot; Matt.19:16-20 Is not the Sabbath included in these 
  commandments? Surely it is! Then how absurd to believe that Jesus, just at the 
  close of his ministry, should teach that the way; the only way, to enter into 
  life, was to keep the commandments, one of which was to be abolished in a few 
  months from that time, without the least intimation from him or his Father 
  that it was to take place. I say again, if the Sabbath is abolished, we ask 
  those who teach it to cite us to the chapter and verse, not to the law of 
  rites and ceremonies which are abolished, for we have already shown that the 
  Sabbath was instituted more than twenty-five hundred years before Moses wrote 
  the carnal ordinances or ceremonies. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God said, &quot;Abraham kept my charge, my 
  commandments, my statutes, and my laws.&quot; Gen.26:5 This must include the 
  Sabbath, for the Sabbath was the first law given, therefore if Abraham did not 
  keep the Sabbath, I cannot understand what commandments, statutes and laws 
  mean in this chapter. Jesus says, &quot;As I have kept my Father's commandments,&quot; 
  John 15:10 Did he keep the commandments? Yes. Mark and Luke, before quoted - 
  (but more of this in another place.) </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In John 7:19, Jesus speaks of &quot;Moses 
  law,&quot; &quot;your law.&quot; 10:34 Again, &quot;their law.&quot; 15:25 Here then we show that Jesus 
  kept up a clear distinction between what God calls my law and commandments and 
  Moses law, &quot;their law,&quot; &quot;your law.&quot; Let us now look at the argument of the 
  Apostles. Paul preaching at Antioch taught the Brethren that by Jesus Christ 
  all who believed in him &quot;are justified from all things, from which ye could 
  not be justified by the Law of Moses.&quot; Acts 13:39 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pharisees said &quot;that it was needful 
  to circumcise them and commend them to keep the Law of Moses.&quot; 15:5 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, when Paul had come to Jerusalem 
  the second time, (fourteen years from the time he met the Apostles in 
  conference where they established the decrees for the churches. See Acts 
  20:19; Gal.2:1,) the Apostles shewed him how many thousands of Jews there were 
  which believed and were zealous of the law: &quot;And they are informed of thee, 
  that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses 
  and the customs.&quot; 21:20,21 Any person who will carefully read the eight 
  chapters here included, must be thoroughly convinced that the Apostle's 
  troubles were about the law of ceremonies written and given by Moses, and 
  nothing to do with the ten commandments. For you see a little before he comes 
  to Jerusalem, he had been preaching at Corinth every Sabbath for eighteen 
  months. 18:4,11 And this, be it remembered, was more than twenty years after 
  the Jewish Sabbaths and ceremonies were nailed to the cross. - And you see 
  that Paul was the man above all the Apostles to be persecuted on account of 
  the abolition of the Jews' law of ceremonies, for he was the &quot;great Apostle to 
  the Gentiles: and if the &quot;Sabbath of the Lord our God&quot; was to have been 
  abolished when the Saviour died, Paul was the very man selected for that 
  purpose. It is clear, therefore, that he did not abolish the seventh day 
  Sabbath among the Gentiles. This same Apostle tells the Romans &quot;that Christ is 
  the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.&quot; 10:4 Again, 
  that &quot;sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the law but 
  under grace&quot; 6:14 Once more: He says the Gentiles having not the law, are a 
  law unto themselves. Why? Because, he says in the next verse, it shows the law 
  written on their hearts. The law of ceremonies? No; that which was on tables 
  of stone. 2:14-16 We might quote much more which looks like embracing the 
  whole law. Let us now look at a few texts in the same letter, which will draw 
  a distinguishing line between the two codes of laws. Paul, in the 7 ch.9-13v, 
  brings to view the carnal commandment, and the one unto life, and sums up his 
  argument in these words: &quot;Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy 
  and just and good.&quot; In the 7v he quotes from the decalogue. Again, he that 
  loveth another hath fulfilled the law. How? </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why thou shalt not steal, nor commit 
  adultery, nor bear false witness, nor covet, thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
  thyself. Therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Rom.13:8,10 - This then 
  is what the Saviour taught the young man to do to secure &quot;eternal life.&quot; Matt. 
  Once more, in concluding a long argument on the law in Rom.3:31, he closes 
  with this language: &quot;Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid 
  ye, we establish the law.&quot; - What law is here established? not the law of 
  rites and ceremonies. What then, for Paul means some law. It can be no other 
  than what he calls the law of &quot;life,&quot; of &quot;love,&quot; the ten commandments. How 
  could even that be established twenty-nine years after the crucifixion, if one 
  of the greatest commandments had been abolished out of the code, that is the 
  Sabbath. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul's letter to the Corinthians teaches 
  that &quot;circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of 
  the commandments of God.&quot; 7:19 Again, in his epistle to the Galatians, his 
  phraseology is somewhat changed, but the argument is to the same point, 
  although some passages read as though every vestige of law was swept by the 
  board when Jesus hung upon the cross. For instance, such as the following: 
  &quot;But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident, 
  for the just shall live by faith, and the LAW is not of faith, but the man 
  that doeth them shall live by them.&quot; &quot;Christ hath redeemed us from the curse 
  of the law, being made a curse for us.&quot; &quot;But before faith came we were kept 
  under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.&quot; 
  &quot;Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might 
  be justified by faith, but after that faith has come we are no longer under a 
  schoolmaster.&quot; Gal.3:11-13,23-25 Again: &quot;For as many as are of the works of 
  the law are under the curse.&quot; 10v. Now are we to understand from these texts 
  that whosoever continueth in the law is cursed, and that the law, the whole 
  law, was abolished when Christ came as our schoolmaster, he being the &quot;end of 
  the law?&quot; Rom.10:4 If so, how is it possible for any man, even Paul himself, 
  to be saved. But we do not believe that Paul taught these brethren any 
  different doctrine than what has already been shown in the Acts, Romans, and 
  Corinthians, and also the Eph., Phil., Col., and Heb. If he did not mean the 
  law written by the hand of Moses, distinguishing it from the law of the ten 
  commandments, written by the finger of God on tables of stone, then pray tell 
  me if you can, what he means (in the closing of this argument,) by saying, 
  &quot;For all the LAW is FULFILLED in one word, even this: Thou shalt love thy 
  neighbor as thyself.&quot; 5:14 Surely he is quoting the Saviour's words in 
  Matt.22:39, relative to the commandment of the Lord our God. To his son 
  Timothy he says: &quot;Now the end of the commandment is charity, (love) meaning of 
  course the last part of the ten commandments. In 6:2, he says: &quot;Bear ye one 
  anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ.&quot; Does this differ from the 
  law of God? Yes, a little, for it is the new commandment, (some say the 
  eleventh.) See John 13:34 &quot;A new commandment I give unto you, (what is it, 
  Lord?) that ye love one another.&quot; And also 20:12 The other is to love our 
  neighbor as ourself. John says: &quot;And this commandment have we from him 
  (Christ) that he who loveth God loveth his brother also.&quot; John 4:21, and 
  2:8-11 In this letter to the Ephesians he says: &quot;Having abolished in his flesh 
  the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.&quot; 2:15 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the reverse 6:2. To the Colossians 
  he asks, &quot;Why as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances 
  where all are to perish with their using?&quot; And says: &quot;Touch not, taste not, 
  handle not,&quot; (Does Paul here teach us to forsake the ordinances of God, 
  instituted by the Saviour - Baptism and the Lord's Supper? Yes, just as 
  clearly as he does to forsake the whole law.) </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When writing to the Hebrews more than 
  thirty years after the crucifixion, he calls these ordinances carnal, imposed 
  on them (the Jews) until Christ our High Priest should come. 9:10,11 He also 
  calls the law of commandments carnal, too, and says: &quot;For there is verily a 
  disannulling of the commandments going before, for the law made nothing 
  perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.&quot; 7:16,18-19 &quot;For when Moses 
  had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the 
  blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and 
  sprinkled both the BOOK and all the people.&quot; 9:19 Now we see clearly that the 
  book of the law of Moses from which Paul has been quoting through the whole 
  before mentioned epistles, is as distinctly separate from the tables of stone 
  (or fleshly table of the heart,) as they were when deposited in the Ark thirty 
  three hundred years ago. Therefore we think that here is clear proof that he 
  has kept up the distinction between the &quot;handwriting of ordinances&quot; (meaning 
  Moses' own handwriting in his book,) and the &quot;ten commandments written by the 
  finger of God.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now turn to the Epistle of James, 
  said to be written more than twenty-five years after the law of ceremonies 
  were nailed to the cross, and see if he does not teach us distinctly, that we 
  are bound to keep the commandments given on tables of stone. He says, &quot;the man 
  that shall be a DOER of the perfect law of liberty shall be blessed in his 
  deed.&quot; 1:25 &quot;If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, thou 
  shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well.&quot; Why? Because the Saviour in 
  quoting from the commandments, in answer to the Ruler, what he should do to 
  inherit eternal life, taught the same doctrine. Matt.19:19 Further: &quot;For 
  whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, shall be 
  guilty of all.&quot; In the next verse he quotes from the ten commandments again, 
  namely, Adultery and Murder (what the Saviour in the fifth chapter of Matt. 
  calls the least, that is the smallest commandment,) and says if we commit them 
  we become transgressors of the law. Of what law? Next verse says the law of 
  liberty by which we are to be &quot;judged.&quot; 2:8,11 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now will it not be admitted by every 
  reasonable person that James has included the whole of the ten commandments, 
  by calling them the perfect law of liberty. 2d, &quot;The royal law according to 
  the scripture,&quot; and 3d, &quot;the law of liberty by which we are to be judged.&quot; 
  (Royal relates to imperial and kingly.) Perfect means COMPLETE, entire, the 
  WHOLE. Then I understand James thus: This law emanated from the king, the 
  Supreme Ruler of the universe, and to be perfect must be just what it was when 
  it came from his hand, and that no change had, or could take place, (and 
  remember now, this is more than twenty-five years since the ceremonies with 
  the Jewish Sabbaths were nailed to the cross,) for the very best of reasons, 
  until the judgment, because he shows that we are to be judged by that law. 
  Then I ask by what parity of reasoning any one can make the law of the ten 
  commandments perfect, while they at the same time assert that the fourth one 
  is abolished? and that on no better evidence than calling it the JEWISH 
  Sabbath. Now let us look at the Apostle John's testimony. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And hereby we do know that we know him 
  if we keep his commandments. He that saith I know him and keepeth not his 
  commandments is a LIAR, and the truth is not in him.&quot; Now no man, more 
  especially one who professes to abide by the whole truth, feels entirely easy 
  if he is called a liar. Now John please explain yourself. Hear him: &quot;Brethren, 
  I write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from 
  the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the 
  BEGINNING.&quot; What do you mean by beginning? Turn to my Gospel, 1st ch. &quot;In the 
  beginning was the word,&quot; - &quot;the same same was in the beginning with God.&quot; 1,2 
  See Gen.1 ch.: &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&quot; Then 
  you are pointing us to the seventh day Sabbath of rest, for the old 
  commandment in the beginning. 2:3 Certainly there is no other place to point 
  to. Does not Jesus point us to the same place for the beginning when marriage 
  was first instituted. Matt.xix:4 In my second letter to the church, I have 
  taught the same doctrine: viz. &quot;This is the commandment that as ye have heard 
  from the beginning ye should walk in it.&quot; (practice it.) 2:5,6 &quot;A new 
  commandment I write unto you.&quot; 7th v. This is the one that Jesus gave us on 
  that memorable night in which he was betrayed, after he had instituted the 
  sacrament and washed our feet. He said &quot;By this shall all men know that ye are 
  my disciples if ye have love one to another.&quot; 13:34,35 The first then teaches 
  us, Love to God, 2d, to Love our neighbor as ourself; &quot;on these two 
  commandments (says Jesus) hang all the law and the prophets.&quot; Then we 
  understand this is the essence of the ten commandments, and if we do not keep 
  the Sabbath we do not love God. Jesus says, &quot;If ye love me ye will keep my 
  commandments.&quot; We are repeatedly told that the Sabbath was changed or forever 
  abolished, at the crucifixion of our Lord, and it is stated by the most 
  competent authorities that John wrote this epistle about sixty years 
  afterwards, and that about six years after this our blessed Lord revealed to 
  him the state of the Church down to the judgment of the great day. In the 14 
  ch. Rev.6-11, he saw three angels following each other in succession: first 
  one preaching the everlasting gospel (second advent doctrine); 2d, announcing 
  the fall of Babylon; 3d, calling God's people out of her by showing the awful 
  destruction that awaited all such as did not obey. He sees the separation and 
  cries out, &quot;Here is the patience of the Saints, here are they that keep the 
  commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.&quot; And this picture was so deeply 
  impressed on his mind, that when the Saviour said to him &quot;Behold I come 
  quickly and my reward is with me,&quot; he seemed to understand this, saying - 
  &quot;Blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the 
  tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.&quot; 22:14 Now it 
  seems to me that the seventh day Sabbath is more clearly included in these 
  commandments, than thou shalt not steal, nor kill, nor commit adultery, for it 
  is the only one that was written at the creation or in the beginning. He 
  allows no stopping place this side of the gates of the city. Then, if we do 
  not keep that day, John has made out his case, that we are all liars. We say 
  in every other case the type must be continued until it is superseded by the 
  antitype, as in the case of the passover, until our Lord was crucified. So 
  then, as Paul tells us, &quot;there remaineth a keeping of the Sabbath to the 
  people of God,&quot; and that we believe will be in the Millennium, the seven 
  thousandth year, so that the seventh day Sabbath and no other will answer for 
  the type, and those who keep the first or the eighth day Sabbath cannot 
  consistently look for the antitype of rest or the great Sabbath, short of one 
  thousand years in the future. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again: Isaiah says: &quot;To the law and to 
  the testimony if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is 
  no light in them.&quot; 8:20 Now if the Gentiles are under no law, as is asserted, 
  pray tell me what right, as Gentiles, have we to appeal to the law and 
  testimony, or to this text. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 24 of Matt. our Saviour says to 
  his disciples, in answer to their questions, When shall these things be? and 
  what shall be the sign of thy coming, and the end of the world? &quot;When ye 
  therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the 
  prophet, stand in the holy place,&quot; &amp;c. 15v. &quot;Pray ye that your flight be not 
  in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.&quot; 20v. The first question is, at 
  what age of the world is this, where our Lord recognizes the Sabbath? 1st. It 
  is agreed on all hands that this time to which he here refers, never 
  transpired until the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, about forty years 
  after his crucifixion. 2d. Some others say, down to the second Advent! The 
  first mentioned is safe ground and sufficient for our purpose; nor need we 
  stop to inquire why our Lord gave these directions, it is forever settled that 
  he directed the minds of his followers to THE, not a Sabbath. Keep it in 
  remembrance, that he told the Pharisees that he was Lord, not of a, but of THE 
  Sabbath, meaning that one which of course had already been established. The 2d 
  question is, did our Lord ever trifle with, or mislead his disciples? The 
  response is No! Then it is clear that if he taught them to pray at all, it 
  must be in faith, and he of course would hear them and mediate with the Father 
  to change the day of their flight. I ask what kind of a prayer and with what 
  kind of faith would his disciples have asked to have this day changed, if as 
  we are told, it was abolished some forty years before, and they had, contrary 
  to the will of God, persisted in keeping up this seventh day Sabbath. Any one 
  who has confidence in God's word, knows that such a prayer never would be 
  answered. What if you do say the Jews always kept that Sabbath and it was the 
  same seventh day Sabbath which they kept when he was teaching them in their 
  synagogues? I, say so too! and that fact will be presented by and by, in its 
  place. This does not touch the point. Jesus was here giving instructions to 
  his followers, both Jew and Gentile, respecting the Sabbath which they would 
  have to do with. It is immaterial what kind of sophistry is presented to 
  overthrow the point, nothing can touch it short of proving it a 
  mistranslation. Jesus did here recognize the perpetuity of the seventh day 
  Sabbath. And John will continue to make all men liars that say they know him 
  and refuse the light presented and disregard this commandment. If God 
  instituted the Sabbath in Paradise and has not abolished it here, then must it 
  be perpetual? If Paul's argument in iii. Rom. that the law is established 
  through faith, is correct then is it perpetual. If James' royal perfect law of 
  liberty, which we are to be doers of, and judged by, means the commandments, 
  then is the Sabbath perpetual. If the Apostle John has made out a clear case, 
  by citing us back to the beginning of creation, and by walking in and doing 
  these commandments, we shall have right to the tree of life and enter in by 
  the gates into the city; then it must be perpetual. If the earthly Sabbath is 
  typical of the heavenly, then must it be perpetual. If not one jot or one 
  tittle can ever pass from the law, then must it be perpetual. If the Saviour, 
  in answer to the young man who asked him what he should do to inherit eternal 
  life, gave a safe direction for Gentiles to follow, viz: &quot;If thou wilt enter 
  into life keep the commandments (and these included those commandments which 
  his Father had given), then, without contradiction the Sabbath is perpetual, 
  and all the arguments which ever can be presented against the fourth 
  commandment being observed before God wrote it on tables of stone to prove 
  that it is not binding on Gentiles, falls powerless before this one sentence: 
  If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. I say the proof is 
  positive that the Sabbath was a constituent part of the commandments, and 
  Jesus says the Sabbath `was made for man.' The Jews were only a fragment of 
  creation. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The principle is settled in all 
  governments that there are but two ways in which any law can cease to be 
  binding upon the people. It may expire by its own limitations, or it may be 
  repealed by the same authority which enacted it; and in the latter case the 
  repealing act must be as explicit as that by which the obligation was 
  originally imposed.&quot; Now we have it in proof that the Sabbath was instituted 
  in Paradise, the first of all laws without any limitation, and no enactment by 
  God to abolish it, unless what we have already referred to can be considered 
  proof. One more passage which I have not alluded to will show that it was not 
  abolished at the crucifixion for his disciples kept the Sabbath while he was 
  resting in his tomb. See Luke 23:55,56 Let us now pass to another part of the 
  subject. The third question: </p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>WAS THE SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH EVER CHANGED? <br>
  IF SO, WHEN, AND FOR WHAT REASON? </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we come to a question which has 
  more or less engaged the attention of the whole Christian world, and the 
  greater portion of those who believe in a crucified Saviour say that this 
  change took place, and is dated from his resurrection. Some say subsequently, 
  while a minority insist upon it that there is no proof for the change. Now to 
  obtain the truth and nothing but the truth on this important subject, I 
  propose to present, or quote from standard authors on both sides of the 
  question, and try the whole by the standard of divine truth. 1st. Buck's 
  Theological Dictionary, to which no doubt thousands of ministers and laymen 
  appeal to sustain their argument for the change, says: &quot;Under the Christian 
  dispensation the Sabbath is altered from the seventh to the first day of the 
  week.&quot; The arguments for the change, are these: 1st. &quot;The seventh day was 
  observed by the Jewish church in memory of the rest of God; so the first day 
  of the week has always been observed by the Christian Church in memory of 
  Christ's resurrection. 2d. Christ made repeated visits to his disciples on 
  that day. 3d. It is called the Lord's day. Rev.1:10 - 4th. On this day the 
  Apostles were assembled, when the Holy Ghost came down so visibly upon them to 
  qualify them for the conversion of the world. 5th. On this day we find Paul at 
  Troas when the disciples came together to break bread. 6th. The directions the 
  Apostles gave to Christians plainly alludes to their assembling on that day. 
  7th. Pliny bears witness of the first day of the week being kept as a festival 
  in honor of the resurrection of Christ.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Numerous have been the days appointed 
  by man for religious services, but these are not binding because of human 
  institution. Not so the Sabbath. It is of divine institution, so it is to be 
  kept holy unto the Lord.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doct. Dodridge, whose ability and piety 
  has seldom or rarely been disputed, comments on some of the above articles 
  thus: (Commentary p.606.) &quot;Upon the first day of the week let every one of you 
  lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings 
  when I come.&quot; 1Cor.16:2 &quot;Show that it was to be put into a common stock. The 
  argument drawn from hence for the religious observance of the first day of the 
  week in these primitive churches of Corinth and Galacia is too obvious to need 
  any further illustration, and yet too important to be passed by in entire 
  silence.&quot; Again, p.904, &quot;I was in the spirit on the Lord's day,&quot; &amp;c. Rev.1:10 
  &quot;It is so very unnatural and contrary to the use of the word in all other 
  authors to interpret this of the Jewish Sabbath, as Mr. Baxter justly argues 
  at large, that I cannot but conclude with him and the generality of Christian 
  writers on this subject, that this text strongly infers the extraordinary 
  regard paid to the first day of the week in the Apostle's time as a day 
  solemnly consecrated to Christ in memory of his resurrection from the dead.&quot; 
  There is much more, but these are his strong arguments. I shall quote some 
  more from the Commentaries by and by. I wish to place by the side of these 
  arguments one from the British Quarterly Theological Review and Ecclesiastical 
  Recorder, of Jan.1830, which I extract from `the Institution of the Sabbath 
  day,' by Wm. Logan Fisher, of Philadelphia, a book in which there is much 
  valuable information on this subject, though I disagree with the writer, 
  because his whole labor is to abolish the Sabbath; yet he gives much light on 
  this subject, from which I take the liberty to make some quotations. But to 
  the Quarterly Review of 1830: </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is said that the observance of the 
  seventh day Sabbath is transferred in the Christian Church to the first day of 
  the week. We ask by what authority, and are very much mistaken if an 
  examination of all the texts of the New Testament, in which the first day of 
  the week or Lord's day is mentioned, does not prove that there is no divine or 
  Apostolic precept enjoining its observance, nor any certain evidence from 
  Scripture that it was, in fact, so observed in the times of the Apostles. 
  Accordingly we search the Scriptures in vain, either for an Apostolic precept, 
  appointing the first day of the week to be observed in the place of the Jewish 
  Sabbath, or for any unequivocal proof that the first Christians so observed it 
  - there are only three or, at most four places of Scripture, in which the 
  first day of the week is mentioned. The next passage is in Acts 20:7 `Upon the 
  first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul 
  preached unto them.' All that St. Luke here tells us plainly is, that on a 
  particular occasion the Christians of Troas met together on the first day of 
  the week to celebrate the Eucharist and to hear Paul preach. This is the only 
  place in Scripture in which the first day of the week is in any way connected 
  with any acts of public worship, and he who would certainly infer from this 
  SOLITARY INSTANCE that the first day of every week was consecrated by the 
  Apostles to religious purposes, must be far gone in the art of drawing 
  universal conclusion from particular premises.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On page 178, Mr. Fisher says: </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have examined several different 
  translations of the Scriptures, both from the Hebrew and the Septuagint, with 
  notes and annotations more extensive than the texts; have traced as far as my 
  leisure would permit, various ecclesiastical histories, some of them 
  voluminous and of ancient date; have paid considerable attention to the 
  writings of the earliest authors in the Christian era, and to rare works, old 
  and of difficult access, which treat upon this subject; I have read with care 
  many of the publications of sectarians to sustain the institution; I have 
  omitted nothing within my reach, and I have found not one shred of argument, 
  or authority of any kind, that may not be deemed of partial and sectarian 
  character, to support the institution of the fist day of the week as a day of 
  peculiar holiness. But, in the place of argument, I have found opinions 
  without number - volumes filled with idle words that have no truth in them. In 
  the want of texts of Scripture, I have found perversions; in the want of 
  truth, false statements. I have seen it stated that Justin Martyr in his 
  apology, speaks of Sunday as a holy day; that Eusebius, bishop of Cesarea, who 
  lived in the fourth century, establishes the fact of the transfer of the 
  SEVENTH to the first day, by Christ himself. These things are NOT TRUE. These 
  authors say no such thing. I have seen other early authors referred to as 
  establishing the same point, but they are equally false.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here then is the testimony of four 
  authors, two for the change and two against it, from the old and new world. No 
  truth seeking, unbiased mind can hesitate for a moment on which side to 
  decide, after comparing them with the inspired word. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor JENKS of Boston, author of the 
  Comprehensive Commentary, (purporting to comprehend all other commentators on 
  the bible,) after quoting author after author, on this subject, ventures forth 
  with his unsupported opinion in these words: &quot;Here is a Christian Sabbath 
  observed by the disciples and owned by our Lord. The visit Christ made to his 
  disciples was on the first day of the week, and the fist day of the week is 
  the only day of the week or month or year ever mentioned by numbers in all the 
  New Testament, and that is several times spoken of as a day religiously 
  observed.&quot; Where? Echo answers, where! </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HEMAN HUMPHREY, President of Amherst 
  College, from whose book I have already made some quotations, after devoting 
  some thirty-four pages to the establishment and perpetuation of the seventh 
  day Sabbath, comes to his fourth question, viz. `Has the day been changed?' 
  Singular as this question may appear by the side of what he had already 
  written to establish and perpetuate the seventh day Sabbath from the seventh 
  day of creation down to the resurrection of the just, but as every man feels 
  that it his privilege to justify and explain, when precept and practice does 
  not agree - so is it with President Humphrey, he can now shape the Scriptures 
  to suit every one that has followed in the wake of Pope Gregory for 1225 
  years. He says, &quot;The fourth commandment is so expressed as to admit of a 
  change in the day,&quot; - thus striking vitally every argument he had before 
  presented. Hear him - he says the seventh day is the Sabbath; it was so at 
  that time, (in the beginning) and for many ages after, but it is not said, 
  that it always shall be - it is the Sabbath day which we are to remember; and 
  so at the close, it is the Sabbath which was hallowed and blessed and not the 
  seventh day. The Sabbath then, the holy rest itself, is one thing. The day on 
  which we are to rest is another.&quot; I ask, in the name of common sense, how we 
  should know how or when to keep the Sabbath if it did not matter which day. If 
  the President could not see the sanctification of the seventh day in the 
  decalogue what did he mean by quoting Gen.2:3, so often, where it says &quot;God 
  blessed the seventh day and sanctified it.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, he says; &quot;Redemption is a greater 
  work than Creation, hence the change.&quot; Fifthly, God early consecrated the 
  Christian Sabbath by a most remarkable outpouring of his spirit at the day of 
  Pentecost. And that Jesus has left us his own example by not saying a syllable 
  after his resurrection about keeping the Jewish Sabbath. He also quotes the 
  four passages about Jesus and his disciples keeping the first day of the week. 
  Here, he says, the inference to our minds is irresistible - for keeping the 
  first day of the week instead of the seventh. And further says, it might be 
  proved by innumerable quotations from the writings of the Apostolic Fathers,&quot; 
  &amp;c. All this may be very true in itself, but it all falls to the ground for 
  the want of one single precept from the Bible. If Redemption, because it was 
  greater than Creation, and the remarkable display of God's power at the 
  Pentecost, and Christ never saying any thing about the Jewish Sabbath after 
  his resurrection are such strong proofs that the perpetual seventh day Sabbath 
  was changed to the first day at that time, and must be believed because 
  learned men say so, what shall we do with the sixth day, on which our blessed 
  Saviour expired on the cross; darkness for three hours had covered the earth, 
  and the vail of the Temple was rent from top to bottom, and there was such an 
  earthquake throughout vast creation that we have only to open our eyes and 
  look at the rent rocks for a clear and perfect demonstration that this whole 
  globe was shaken from centre to circumference, and the graves of the dead were 
  opened. Matt.27:50,53 You may answer me that Popery has honored that day by 
  calling it Good Friday, and the next first day following Easter Sunday, &amp;c., 
  but after all, nothing short of Bible argument will satisfy the earnest 
  inquirer after truth. The President had already shown that the Jewish Sabbath 
  was abolished at Christ's death. What reason then had he to believe that the 
  Saviour would speak of it afterwards. - So also the Pentecost had been a type 
  from the giving the law at Sinai to be kept annually for about 1500 years, 
  consequently it would be solemnized on every day of the week, at each 
  revolving year, as is the case with the 4th of July: three years ago it was on 
  the fourth day and now it comes on the seventh day of the week. Further, see 
  Peter standing amidst the amazed multitude, giving the Scripture reason for 
  this miraculous display of God's power. He does not give the most distant hint 
  that this was, or was to be, the day of the week for worship, or true Sabbath, 
  neither do any of the Apostles then, or afterwards, for when they kept this 
  day the next year, it must have been the second day of the week. We must have 
  better evidence than what has been adduced, to believe this was the Sabbath, 
  for according to the type, seven Sabbaths were to be complete, (and there was 
  no other way given them to come to the right day,) from the day they kept the 
  first, or from the resurrection. Here then is proof positive that the Sabbath 
  in this year was the day before the Pentecost. See Luke 23:55,56 If President 
  H. is right, then was there two Sabbaths to be kept in succession in one week. 
  Where is the precept? Nowhere! Well, says the inquirer, I want to see the 
  Bible proof for this &quot;Christian Sabbath observed by the disciples, and owned 
  by our Lord.&quot; W. Jenks. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here it will be necessary for us to 
  understand, first how God has computed time. In Gen.1. we read, &quot;And God said 
  let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the 
  night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.&quot; 14 
  v. 16 v. says, &quot;the greater light to rule the day,&quot; - from sunrise to sunset. 
  Now there are many modes invented for computing time. We say our day begins at 
  12 o'clock at night; seamen begin theirs twelve hours sooner, at noon; the 
  Jews commence their days at 6 o'clock in the evening, between the two 
  extremes. Are we all right? No! Who shall settle this question? God! Very 
  well: He called the light day, and the darkness he called night, and the 
  evening and the morning were the first day. Gen.1:5 Then the twenty-four hour 
  day commenced at 6 o'clock in the evening. How is that, says one? Because you 
  cannot regulate the day and night to have what the Saviour calls twelve hours 
  in the day, without establishing the time from the centre of the earth, the 
  equator, where, at the beginning of the sacred year, the sun rises and sets at 
  6 o'clock. At this time, while the sun is at the summer solstice, the 
  inhabitants of the north pole have no night, while at this same time at the 
  south it is about all night, therefore the inhabitants of the earth have no 
  other right time to commence their twenty-four hour day, than beginning at 6 
  o'clock in the evening. God said to Moses &quot;from even, unto even, shall you 
  celebrate your Sabbath.&quot; Then of course the next day must begin where the 
  Sabbath ended. History shows that the Jews obeyed and commenced their days at 
  6 o'clock in the evening. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now then we will try to investigate the 
  main argument by which these authors, and thousands of others say the Sabbath 
  was changed. The first is in John 20:19, &quot;Then the same day at evening, being 
  the first day of the week when the doors where shut where the disciples were 
  assembled for fear of the Jews (mark it) came Jesus and stood in their midst, 
  and said peace unto you.&quot; Here we understand this to be the same day of the 
  resurrection. On that same day he travelled with the two disciples to Emmaus, 
  sixty furlongs (7 and a half miles), and they constrained him to abide with 
  them, for it was toward evening and the day was far spent. Luke 24:29 After 
  this the disciples travelled the 7 and a half miles back to Jerusalem and soon 
  after they found the disciples, the Saviour, as above stated, was in their 
  midst. Now it cannot be disputed but what this was the evening after the 
  resurrection, for Jesus rose in the morning, some ten or eleven hours after 
  the first day had commenced. Then the evening of the first day was passing 
  away, and therefore the evening brought to view in the text was the close of 
  the first day or the commencing of the second. McKnight's translation says &quot;in 
  the evening of that day.&quot; Purver's translation says, &quot;the evening of that day 
  on the first after the Sabbath.&quot; Further, wherever the phrase first day of the 
  week, occurs in the New Testament, the word day is in italics, showing that it 
  is not the original; but supplied by translators. Again, it is asserted that 
  Jesus met with his disciples the next first day. See 26 v: &quot;And after eight 
  days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them, then came Jesus, 
  the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said peace be unto you.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Adam Clark in referring to this 26v, 
  says: &quot;It seems likely that this was precisely on that day se' night on which 
  Christ had appeared to them before; and from this we may learn that this was 
  the weekly meeting of the Apostles.&quot; Now it appears to me that a little child, 
  with the simple rules of addition and subtraction, could have refuted this 
  man. I feel astonished that men who profess to be ambassadors for God do not 
  expose such downright perversions of Scripture, but it may look clear to those 
  who want to have it so. Not many months since, in conversation with the Second 
  Advent lecturer in New Bedford, I brought up this subject. He told me I did 
  not understand it. See here, says he, I can make it plain, counting his 
  fingers thus: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 
  Sunday - doesn't make eight days after? and because I would not concede, he 
  parted from me as one that was obstinate and self-willed. Afterwards musing on 
  the subject, I said, this must be the way then to understand it: Count Sunday 
  Twice. If any of them were to be paid for eight days labor, they would detect 
  the error in a moment if their employer should attempt to put the first and 
  last days together, and offer them pay but for seven. Eight days after the 
  evening of the first day would stand thus: The second day of the week would 
  certainly be the first of the eight. Then to count eight days of twenty-four 
  hours after, we must begin at the close of the evening of the first, and count 
  to the close of the evening of the second day; to where the Jews (by God's 
  command) commenced their third day. But suppose we calculate it by our mode of 
  keeping time. Our Lord appears to his disciples the first time at the close of 
  Sunday evening. Now count eight days after, (with your fingers or anything 
  else,) and it will bring you to Monday evening. Now I ask if this looks like 
  Sunday, the first day of the week? </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father Miller also gives his reasons for 
  the change, in his lecture on the great Sabbath: &quot;One is Christ's resurrection 
  and his often meeting with his disciples afterwards on that day. This, with 
  the example of the Apostles, is strong evidence that the proper creation 
  Sabbath to man, came on the first day of the week.&quot; His proof is this: &quot;Adam 
  must have rested on the first day of his life, and thus you will see that to 
  Adam it was the first day of the week, for it would not be reasonable to 
  suppose that Adam began to reckon time before he was created. He certainly 
  could not be able to work six days before the first Sabbath. And thus with the 
  second Adam; the first day of the week he arose and lived. And we find by the 
  Bible and by history, that the first day of the week &quot;was ever afterwards 
  observed as a day of worship.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I say there is no more truth in 
  these assertions, than there is in those I have already quoted. There is not 
  one passage in the Bible to show that Christ met with his disciples on the 
  first day of the week after the day of his resurrection, not that the first 
  day of the week was ever afterwards observed as a day of worship; save only in 
  one instance, and that shall be noticed in its place. And it seems to me if 
  Adam could not reckon time only from his creation then by the same rule no 
  other man could reckon time before his birth, and by this showing Christ could 
  not reckon his time until after his resurrection. It is painful to me to 
  expose the errors of one whom I have so long venerated, and still love for the 
  flood of light he has given the world in respect to the Second Advent of our 
  Saviour; but God's word must be vindicated if we have to cut off a right arm, 
  &quot;there is nothing true but truth!&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pray God to forgive him in joining the 
  great multitude of Advent believers, to sound the retreat back beyond the 
  tarrying time, just when the virgins had gained a glorious victory over the 
  world, the flesh, and the devil! Go back from this to the slumbering quarters 
  now; nothing but treachery to our Master's cause ever dictated such a course! 
  I never can be made to believe that our glorious Commander designed that we 
  should leave our sacrifices smoking on the altar of God, in the midst of the 
  enemies' land, but rather that we should be pushing onward from victory to 
  victory, until we are established in the Capital of His kingdom. Would it have 
  been expedient or a mark of courage in General Taylor, after he had conquered 
  the Mexican army on the 9th May last, to have retreated back to the capital of 
  the U. States, to place himself and army on the broad platform of liberty, and 
  commence to travel the ground over again for the purpose of pursuing and 
  overcoming his vanquished foe? No! Every person of common sense knows that 
  such a course would have overwhelmed him and all his followers with 
  unutterable disgrace, no matter how unrighteous the contest. Not so with this, 
  for our cause is one of the most glorious, tho' it be the most trying that 
  ever the sun shone upon since God placed it in the heavens. Onward and 
  victory, then, are our watchwords, and no retreating back to, or beyond the 
  cry at Midnight! </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the subject. Did our Saviour ever 
  meet with his disciples on the first day of the week after the evening of the 
  day of his resurrection? The xxi.ch. John says &quot;they went a fishing, and while 
  there Jesus appeared unto them.&quot; In the 14th v. he says, &quot;This is now the 
  third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he was risen 
  from the dead.&quot; Now turn to 1Cor.15:4 - 7; Paul's testimony is, &quot;that he was 
  seen of Cephas, then of the twelve, after that of above five hundred brethren 
  at once, and then of James, then of all the Apostles.&quot; These are all that are 
  specified, up to his going into heaven. Now pray tell me if you can, where 
  these men got their information respecting the frequent meetings on the first 
  day of the week. The Bible says no such thing. But let us pursue the subject 
  and look at the third text, &quot;Upon the first day of the week let every one of 
  you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings 
  when I come.&quot; Now please turn back to Dr. Dodridge's authority, he says the 
  argument is too obvious to need any illustration, that the money was put into 
  common stock, and that this was the religions observance of the first day of 
  the week. Now whoever will read the first six verses of this chapter, and 
  compare them with Rom.15:26 - 33, will see that Paul's design was to collect 
  some money for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and their laying it by them in 
  store until he came that way; for it plainly implies that they were at home, 
  for no one could understand that you had money lying by you in store, if it 
  was in common stock or in other hands. Again, see Acts 18:4,11 Paul preaching 
  every Sabbath day, at this very time, for eighteen months, to these very same 
  Corinthians, bids them farewell, to go up to the feast at Jerusalem. 21v. By 
  reading to 21 ch. 17v. you have his history until he arrives there. Now I ask, 
  if Dr. Dodridge's clear illustration can or will be relied on, when Luke 
  clearly teaches that Paul's manner was, and that he did always preach to them 
  on the Sabbath, which, of course, was the Seventh day, and not the first day 
  of the week. Fourth text, John says: I was in the spirit on the Lord's day. 
  Here Dr. D. concludes with the generality of Christian writers on this subject 
  that this strongly infers the extraordinary regard paid to the first day of 
  the week, as solemnly consecrated to Christ, &amp;c. If the scripture any where 
  called this the Lord's day, there might be some reason to believe their 
  statements, but the seventh day Sabbath is called the Lord's day. See 
  Exod.20:10 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Fisher, in speaking of the late 
  Harrisburg convention of 1844 - 45, says, &quot;The most spirited debate that 
  occurred at the assembly was to fix a proper name for the first day of the 
  week, whether it should be called Sabbath, the Christian Sabbath or Lord's 
  day. The reason for this dispute was, that there was no authority for calling 
  the first day of the week by either one of these names. To pretend that that 
  command was fixed and unchangeable, and yet to alter it to please the fancy of 
  man, is in itself ridiculous. It is hardly possible in the nature of man, that 
  a class of society should be receiving pay for their services and not be 
  influenced thereby; - in the nature of things they will avoid such doctrines 
  as are repugnant to them that give them bread.&quot; </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we come to the fifth and last, and 
  only one spoken of in all the New Testament, for a meeting on the first day of 
  the week. Luke says, &quot;Upon the first day of the week when the disciples came 
  together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the 
  morrow: and continued his speech until midnight.&quot; Acts 20:7 Now by following 
  the scripture mode of computing time, from 6 o'clock in the evening to 6 
  o'clock in the morning, as has been shown, Paul to commence on the beginning 
  of the first day would begin on what we call Saturday evening at 6 o'clock, 
  and preach till midnight. After that he restores to life the young man, then 
  breaks bread and talked till the break of day, which would be Sunday morning. 
  Then he commenced his journey for Jerusalem and travelled and sailed all day 
  Sunday, the first day of the week, and two other days in succession. 20:11 - 
  15 Now it seems to me, if Paul did teach or keep the first day of the week for 
  the Sabbath or a holy day, he violated the sanctity of it to all intents and 
  purposes, without giving one single reason for it; all the proof presented 
  here is a night meeting. Please see the quotation from the British Quarterly 
  Review. But let us look at it the way in which we compute time: I think it 
  will be fair to premise, that about midnight was the middle of Paul's meeting; 
  at any rate there is but one midnight to a twenty-four hour day. We say that 
  Sunday, the first day of the week, does not commence until 12 o'clock Saturday 
  night. Then it is very clear, if he is preaching on the first day till 
  midnight, according to our reckoning it must be on Sunday night, and his 
  celebrating the Lord's supper after midnight would make it that he broke bread 
  on Monday, the second day, and that the day time on Sunday is not included, 
  unless he had continued his speech through the day till midnight. Now the text 
  says that on the first day of the week they came together to break bread. To 
  prove that \they did break bread on that day, we must take the mode in which 
  the Jews computed time, and allow the first day of the week to begin at 6 
  o'clock on Saturday evening, and after daylight, but to travel, &amp;c. If our 
  mode of time is taken, they broke bread on the second day, and that would 
  destroy the meaning of the text. Here then, in this text, is the only argument 
  that can be adduced in the Scriptures of divine truth, for a change of the 
  perpetual seventh day Sabbath of the Lord our God to the first day of the 
  week. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I'll venture the assertion, that 
  there is no law or commandment recorded in the Bible, that God had held so 
  sacred among men, as the keeping of His Sabbath. Where then, I ask, is the 
  living man that dare stand before God and declare that here is the change for 
  the church of God to keep the first instead of the seventh day of the week for 
  the Sabbath. If it could be proved that Paul preached here all of the first 
  day, the only inference that could be drawn, would be, to break bread on that 
  day! </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one more point worthy of our 
  attention, that is, the teaching and example of Jesus. I have been told by one 
  that is looked up to as a strong believer in the second coming of the Lord 
  this fall, that Jesus broke the Sabbath. Jesus says, I have kept my Father's 
  commandments. It is said that he &quot;broke the Sabbath,&quot; because he allowed his 
  disciples to pluck the corn and eat it on that day, and the Pharisees 
  condemned them. He says, &quot;If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy 
  and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.&quot; Then they were 
  not guilty. See Deut.23:25 He immediately cites them to David and his men, 
  shewing that it was lawful and right when hungry, even to eat the shew bread 
  that belonged only to the priests, and told them that he was Lord of the 
  Sabbath day. Here he shows too, that he was with his disciples passing to the 
  synagogue to teach; they ask him if it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath day. 
  He asks them if they had a sheep fall into the ditch on the Sabbath, if they 
  would not haul him out? How much better then is a man than a sheep? Wherefore 
  it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days; and immediately healed the man 
  with a withered hand. Matt.12:1-13 On another Sabbath day, while he was 
  teaching, he healed a woman that had been bound of Satan eighteen years, and 
  when the ruler of the synagogue began to find fault, he called him a 
  hypocrite, and said &quot;doth not each one of you on the Sabbath day loose his ox 
  or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering; and all his 
  adversaries were ashamed.&quot; Luke 13:10-17, The xiv. chapter of Luke is quoted 
  to prove that he broke the Sabbath because he went into the Pharisees house 
  with many others on the Sabbath day to eat bread. Here he saw a man with the 
  dropsy and he asked them if it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath day. `And 
  they held their peace and he took him and healed him,' and asked them `which 
  of them having an ox or an ass fall into the pit, would not straightway pull 
  him out on the Sabbath day; and they could not answer him again.' 1-6 v. And 
  `he continued to teach them, by showing them when they made a feast, to call 
  the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, and then they should be blessed.' 
  Read the chapter, and you will readily see that he took this occasion, as the 
  most befitting, to teach them by parables, what their duty was at weddings and 
  feasts, in the same manner as he taught them in their synagogues. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is still another passage, and I 
  believe the only one, to which reference has been made, (except where he 
  opened the eyes of a man that was born blind,) for proof that he broke the 
  Sabbath. It is recorded in John 5:5-17 Here Jesus found a man that had been 
  sick thirty-eight years, by the pool of Bethesda, `he saith unto him rise, 
  take up thy bed and walk, - therefore did they persecute Jesus and sought to 
  slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.' 16v. `But 
  Jesus answered them, my Father worketh hitherto and I work.' If they did not 
  work every hour and moment of time, it would be impossible for man to exist: 
  Here undoubtedly he had reference to these and other acts of necessity and 
  mercy; but the great sin for which professors in this enlightened age charge 
  the Saviour with in this transaction is, in directing the man to take up his 
  bed, contrary to law. It is clear the people were forbidden to carry burdens 
  on the Sabbath day, as in Jer.17:21,22, but by reading the 24th v. in 
  connection with Neh.13:15 - 22, we learn that this prohibition related to what 
  was lawful for them to do on the other six days of the week, viz. merchandise 
  and trading. See proof, Neh.10:31: also unlawful, as in Amos 8:5 We need not, 
  nor we cannot misunderstand the fourth commandment, taken in connection with 
  the other nine, they were simple and pure written by the finger of God; but in 
  the days of our Saviour it had become heavily laden with Jewish traditions, 
  hence when Jesus appeals to them whether it is lawful to do good and to heal 
  on the Sabbath days, their mouths are closed because they cannot contradict 
  him from the law nor the prophets. The Saviour nowhere interferes with them in 
  their most rigid observance of the day; but when they find fault with him for 
  performing his miracles of mercy on that day, he tells them they have broken 
  the law; and in another place, &quot;If a man on the Sabbath day receive 
  circumcision without breaking the law of Moses, are ye angry at me because I 
  have made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day?&quot; He then says, &quot;Judge not 
  according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.&quot; 7:23,24 Did he 
  break the Sabbath? Now the law requires that the beasts shall rest; but what 
  is the practice of many of those who are the most strict in keeping Sunday for 
  the Sabbath. Sick, or well, ministers or laymen, do they not ride back and 
  forth to meeting? Again, it is right and lawful to carry forth our dead on the 
  Sabbath? or carry the communion service back and forth. The Apostle says, 
  `believe and be baptized.' Suppose this should be on the Sabbath and we were 
  some distance from the water, would any one interfere with us if we carried 
  our change of apparel with us and back again, or have we in so doing 
  transgressed the law; if we have, it is high time we made a full stop. Jesus 
  undoubtedly had good reasons for directing the sick man to take up his bed and 
  walk, but I cannot learn that he justified any one else in carrying their bed 
  on the Sabbath, unless in a case of necessity and mercy, such as he cited them 
  to, as watering their cattle, and pulling them out of the ditch, and eating 
  when hungry, and being healed when sick. Be it also remembered that when the 
  Sanhedrin tried him they did not condemn him, as in the other cases cited; so 
  in this, they failed for want of Scripture testimony. He was the Lord of the 
  Sabbath, and the law of ceremonies were now about to cease forever, the ten 
  commandments with the keeping of the Sabbath therefore were to be stripped of 
  these ceremonies and all of their traditions, and left as pure to be written 
  on the hearts of the Gentiles as when first written on tables of stone, 
  therefore Jesus taught that it was right to do good on the Sabbath day, and 
  whoever follows his example and teaching will keep the seventh day Sabbath 
  holy and acceptable to God. They will also judge righteous judgment, and not 
  according to appearance. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is but one Christian Sabbath 
  named, or established in the Bible, and that individual, whoever he is, that 
  undertakes to abolish or change it, is the real Sabbath breaker. Remember that 
  the keeping the commandments is the only safe guide through the gates into the 
  city. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends and neighbors, and especially 
  my family, know that I have for more than twenty years, strictly endeavored to 
  keep the first day of the week for the Sabbath, and I can say that I did it in 
  all good conscience before God, on the ocean, and in foreign countries as well 
  as any own, until about sixteen months since I read an article published in 
  the Hope of Israel, by a worthy brother, T.M. Preble, of Nashua, which when I 
  read and compared with the Bible, convinced me that there never had been any 
  change. Therefore the seventh day was the Sabbath, and God required me as well 
  as him to keep it holy. Many things now troubled my mind as to how I could 
  make this great change, family, friends, and brethren and, but this one 
  passage of Scripture was, and always will be as clear as a sunbeam. &quot;What is 
  that to thee: follow thou me&quot;. In a few days my mind was made up to begin to 
  keep the fourth commandment, and I bless God for the clear light he has shed 
  upon my mind in answer to prayer and a thorough examination of the scriptures 
  on this great subject. Contrary views did, after a little, shake my position 
  some, but I feel now that there is no argument nor sophistry that can becloud 
  my mind again this side of the gates of the Holy City. Brother Marsh, who no 
  doubt thinks, and perhaps thousands besides, that his paper is what it 
  purports to be, THE VOICE OF TRUTH, takes the ground with the infidel that 
  there is not Sabbath. Brother S.S. Snow, of New York, late editor of the 
  Jubilee Standard, publishes to the world that he is the Elijah, preceding the 
  advent of our Saviour, restoring all things: (the seventh day Sabbath must be 
  one of all things,) and yet he takes the same ground with Br. Marsh, that the 
  Sabbath is forever abolished. As the seventh day Sabbath is a real prophecy, a 
  picture (and not a shadow like the Jewish Sabbaths,) of the thing typified 
  which is to come, I cannot see how those who believe in the change or 
  abolition of the type, can have any confidence to look to God for the great 
  antitype, the Sabbath of rest, to come to them. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brother J.B. Cook has written a short 
  piece in his excellent paper, the ADVENT TESTIMONY, It was pointed and good, 
  but too short; and as brother Preble's Tract now before me, did not embrace 
  the arguments which have been presented since he published it, it appeared to 
  me that something was called for in this time of falling back from this great 
  subject. I therefore present this book, hoping at least, that it will help to 
  strengthen and save all honest souls seeking after truth. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A WORD RESPECTING THE HISTORY. At the 
  close of the first century a controversy arose, whether both days should be 
  kept or only one, which continued until the reign of Constantine the Great. By 
  his laws, made in A.D. 321, it was decreed for the future that Sunday should 
  be kept a day of rest in all the cities and towns; but he allowed the country 
  people to follow husbandry. History further informs us that Constantine 
  murdered his two sisters husbands and son, and his own familiar friend, that 
  same year, and the year before boiled his wife in a cauldron of oil. - The 
  controversy still continued down to A.D. 603, when Pope Gregory passed a law 
  abolishing the seventh day Sabbath, and establishing the first day of the 
  week. See Baronius Councils, 603. Barnfield's Eng. page 116, states that the 
  Parliament of England met on Sundays till the time of Richard II. The first 
  law of England made for keeping of Sunday, was in the time of Edward IV. about 
  1470. As these two books are not within my reach, I have extracted from T.M. 
  Preble's tract on the Sabbath. Mr. Fisher says, it was Dr. Bound one of the 
  rigid Puritans, who applied the name Sabbath to the first day of the week, 
  about the year 1795. &quot;The word Sunday is not found in the bible,&quot; it derived 
  its name from the heathen nations of the North, because the day was dedicated 
  to the sun. Neither is the Sabbath applied to the first day any more than it 
  is to the sixth day of the week. While Daniel beheld the little horn, (popery) 
  he said, among other things, he would think to change times and laws. Now this 
  could not mean of men, because it ever has been the prerogative of absolute 
  rulers like himself, to change manmade-laws. Then to make the prophecy 
  harmonize with the Scripture, he must have meant times and laws established by 
  God, because he might think and pass decrees as he has done, but he, nor all 
  the universe could ever change God's times and laws. Jesus says that &quot;times 
  and seasons were in the power of the father.&quot; The Sabbath is the most 
  important law which God ever instituted. &quot;How long refuse ye to keep my 
  commandments, and my laws, see for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath.&quot; 
  Exod.16:28,29 Then it's clear from the history, that this is in part what 
  Daniel meant. Now the second advent believers have professed all confidence in 
  his visions; why then doubt this. Whoever feels disposed to defend and sustain 
  the decrees of that &quot;blasphemous&quot; power, and especially Pope Gregory and the 
  great Constantine, the murderer, shown to be the moral reformer in this work 
  of changing the Sabbath, are welcome to their principles and feeling. I detest 
  these acts, in common with all others which have emanated from these ten and 
  one horned powers. The Revelations show us clearly that they were originated 
  by the devil. If you say this history is not true then you are bound to refute 
  it. If you cannot, you are as much in duty bound to believe it as any other 
  history, even that George Washington died in 1799! If the Bible argument, and 
  testimony from history are to be relied on as evidence, then it is as clear as 
  a sunbeam that the seventh day Sabbath is a perpetual sign, and is as binding 
  upon man as it ever was. But we are told we must keep the first day of the 
  week for the Sabbath as an ordinance to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus. 
  I for one had rather believe Paul. See Rom.6:3 - 5; Gal.3:27; Col.2:12 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A word more respecting time. See 31st 
  page. Here I have shown that the sun in the centre, regardless all time for 
  the earth - fifty two weeks to the year, one hundred and sixty-eight hours to 
  the week, the seventh of which is twenty-four hours. &quot;Jesus says there are but 
  twelve hours in the day, (from sunrise to sunset.) Then twelve hours night to 
  make a twenty-four hour day, you see, must always begin at a certain period of 
  time. No matter then whether the sun sets with us at eight in summer or 4 
  o'clock in winter. Now by this, and this is the Scripture rule, days and weeks 
  can, and most probably are, kept at the North and South polar regions. What an 
  absurdity to believe that God does exonerate our fathers and brothers from 
  keeping his Sabbath while they are in these polar regions fishing for seals 
  and whales, should it be with them either all day or all night. If they have 
  lost their reckoning of days and weeks, because there was, or was not any sun 
  six months of the time, how could they learn what day of the week it was when 
  they see the sun setting at 6 o'clock on the equator, if bound home from the 
  South? By referring to Luke, 23 ch.55,56, and 24:1, we see that the people in 
  Palestine had kept the days and weeks right from the creation; since which 
  time, astronomers teach us that not even fifteen minutes have been lost. God 
  does not require us to be any more exact in keeping time, than what we may or 
  have learned from the above rules, but I am told there is a difference in time 
  of twenty-four hours to the mariner that circumnavigates the globe. That, 
  being true, is known to them, but it alters no time on the earth or sea. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, says one, I should like to keep the 
  Sabbath in time, just as Jesus did. Then you must live in Palestine, where 
  their day begins seven hours earlier than ours; and yet it is at 6 o'clock in 
  the evening the same period, though not the same by the sun, in which we begin 
  our day. Let me illustrate: our earth, something in the form of an orange, is 
  whirling over every twenty-four hours. It measures three hundred and sixty 
  degrees, or about twenty-one thousand six hundred miles round, in the manner 
  you would pass a string round an orange. Now divide this three hundred and 
  sixty degrees by the twenty-four hour day, and the result is fifteen degrees, 
  or nine hundred miles. Then every fifteen degrees we travel or sail eastward, 
  the sun rises and sets one hour earlier in the period of the twenty-four 
  hours: therefore those who live in Palestine, one hundred and seven degrees 
  east of us, begin and close the day seven hours earlier, so in proportion all 
  the way round the globe, the sun always stationary! Then the Sabbath begins 
  precisely at 6 o'clock on Friday evening, every where on this globe, and ends 
  at the same period on what we call Saturday evening. God says `everything on 
  its day,' `from even unto even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath;' `the evening 
  and the morning was the first day.' He is an exact time keeper! I say then, in 
  the name of all that is holy, heavenly and true, and as immortality is above 
  all price, let us see to it that we are found fearing God and keeping his 
  COMMANDMENTS, for this, we are taught, `is the whole duty of man.' The proof 
  is positive that the seventh day Sabbath is included in the commandments. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bro. Marsh says, &quot;Keeping the Sabbath is 
  embraced in this covenant. Deut. 5:1 - 6, made with the children of Israel at 
  Horeb. It was not made with their Fathers (the Patriarchs) but with us, even 
  us, who are all of us HERE ALIVE THIS DAY. v.3 `This testimony first negative, 
  he made it not with our Fathers, and then positive with us, is conclusive. Not 
  a single proof can be presented from either the old or new testament, that it 
  was instituted for any other people or nation.&quot; Now it is clear and positive 
  that if the Sabbath is not binding on any other people than the Jews, by the 
  same rule not one of the commandments is binding on any other people, who dare 
  take such infidel ground? Was not the second covenant written on the hearts of 
  the Gentile, even the law of Commandments? which Paul says `is Holy, just and 
  good.' Thirty years after the crucifixion he directs the Ephesians to the 
  keeping the fifth commandment, that they may live long on the earth not the 
  land of Canaan. 6:2,3 Did not God say that Abraham kept his commandments, 
  statutes, and laws? This embraced the Sabbath for circumcision, and the 
  Sabbath were then the only laws, or statutes, or commandments written. The 
  fourth commandment was given two thousand years before Abraham was born! Is 
  not the stranger and all within their gates included in the covenant to keep 
  the Sabbath? See Exod.20:10 And did not God require them to keep THE Sabbath 
  before he made this covenant with them in Horeb? See Exod.16:27 - 30 Does not 
  Isaiah say that God will bless the man, and the son of man, and the sons of 
  the stranger, that keep THE Sabbath? These certainly mean the Gentiles. 56:2 - 
  3, 6 - 7 Also, in the 58 ch.13,14, the promise is to all that keep the 
  Sabbath. To what people did the Sabbath belong at the destruction of 
  Jerusalem, nearly forty years after the crucifixion? Matt.24:20 The Gentiles 
  certainly were embraced in the covenant by this time! Why was it Paul's manner 
  always to preach on the seventh day Sabbath to Jews and Gentiles? </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By what authority do you call the 
  seventh day Sabbath, the Jewish Sabbath? The Bible says it is the Sabbath of 
  the Lord our God! And Jesus said that he was the `Lord of the Sabbath day.' He 
  moreover told the Jews that the Sabbath was made for MAN! Where do you draw 
  the distinguishing line, to show which is and which is not MAN between the 
  natural seed of Abraham and the Gentiles? &quot;Is he the God of the Jews only? Is 
  he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also!&quot; Then Paul says `there 
  is no difference,' and that `there is no respect of persons with God.' Is it 
  not clear, then, that the Sabbath was made for Adam and his posterity, the 
  whole family of man? How very fearful you are that God's people should keep 
  the Bible Sabbath! You say, `let us be cautious, lest we disinherit ourselves 
  by seeking the inheritance under the wrong covenant. Your meaning is, not to 
  seek to keep the Sabbath covenant, but the one made to Abraham. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can tell us what precept there is 
  in the Abrahamic covenant that we must now keep to be saved, that is not 
  embraced in the one given at Mount Sinai, then we will endeavor to keep that 
  too, with the Sabbath of the Lord our God. If the Sabbath, as you say, is 
  abolished, why do you, JOSEPH MARSH, continue to call the first day of the 
  week the Sabbath. See V.T., 15th July. If you profess to utter the VOICE OF 
  TRUTH from the bible, do be consistent, and also willing that other papers, 
  besides yours and the Advent Herald, should give the present truth to the 
  flock of God. I say let it go with lightning speed; every way, as does the 
  political news by the electric telegraph. If the whole law and the prophets 
  hang on the commandments, and by keeping them we enter into life, how will 
  you, or I, enter in if we do not `keep the commandments.' See Exod.16:28 - 30 
  Jesus says, &quot;therefore whosoever shall break one of these least commandments 
  and shall teach men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom,&quot; &amp;c. &quot;Fear 
  God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.&quot; Amen! </p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>GOD HAS MADE THREE EVERLASTING COVENANTS WITH MAN. </b>
  </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first one is the Covenant of 
  Inheritance &quot;confirmed unto Jacob for a law and unto Israel for an everlasting 
  Inheritance.&quot; See Psl.105:8 - 11 Acts 7:3 - 6 Eph.1:14 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second is an everlasting Covenant of 
  Redemption.&quot; See Isa.61:8,9 &quot;I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have 
  sworn unto David my servant, thy seed will I establish forever.&quot; Psl.89:2 - 5 
  See also 34 - 37 vs. &quot;My Covenant will I not break, not alter the thing that 
  is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie 
  unto David, his seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me 
  - It shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in 
  heaven.&quot; Isa. says it is sure, 55:3; 54:13,14 Ezekiel calls it a Covenant of 
  peace. 34:25 In 37 ch.25 and 26 v. he shows clearly that David is Christ, and 
  this &quot;Covenant of peace is an everlasting Covenant with his Israel, and will 
  be known when his sanctuary is in the midst of them forever more.&quot; 28 v. The 
  very same is brought to view by Paul Rom.11:26,27 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two everlasting Covenants are 
  conditional, and in the future. The living saints of God inherit them by 
  keeping the `commandments of God and testimony of Jesus, which can be nothing 
  more nor less than what Jer. and Paul calls the `new or second covenant.' 
  Jer.31:31 - 33; Heb.8:6 - 10; by us the Gospel Covenant, confirmed by Christ 
  and his Apostles 1800 years ago. Dan.9:27; Acts 10:36 - 40; Heb.2:3,4 The old 
  or first Covenant was delivered to Moses at Mount Sinai 3337 years ago, and is 
  about 1537 years older than the new, or second, or what we call the Gospel 
  Covenant. Paul to the Heb.9:1, says, `This first Covenant had ordinances of 
  divine service, and a worldly sanctuary,' meaning the Old Tabernacle with all 
  its appendages, (see 23 v.,) and was dedicated with the blood of bulls and 
  goats. 18, 19 v. (Macknight's trans.). See also Exo.24:8; Lev.11:15 This same 
  Covenant was the ten commandments `written on tables of stone by the finger of 
  God.' Exo.34:27,28; Deut.9:4 Moses built a Tabernacle for it. Exo.40:3,21 
  David had it in his heart to build a house for it. 1Chr.28:2 Solomon built the 
  house (the Temple) and put the Ark into it. 2Ch.6:11 These ten commandments 
  then, was the first Covenant. The Tabernacle and all its furniture was 
  appended to it, and was called the Sanctuary, the building that contained it. 
  This Covenant was broken by the Jews, with whom it was first made. 
  Deut.26:15,20; Jer.31:32; Ezek.16:5,9, and 17:19; Isa.33:8 Now how evident it 
  is that the Jewish nation did not destroy nor abolish this Covenant by 
  breaking it. As well may it be said that the man who violates the law of his 
  country has abolished or destroyed the whole law. No, no! men can no more 
  destroy the law God has made than they can put out the light of the sun. They 
  can destroy themselves, but God's work can they never. Hear God speak and may 
  his word annihilate every thought to the contrary: &quot;The Lord thy God he is the 
  faithful God, which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and 
  keep his commandments to a thousand generations.&quot; Is not this as much as 
  63,000 years in the future? Will he break it, then think ye? No, you know it 
  means forever. Deut.7:9 Do you still doubt. Let him speak once more. &quot;My 
  Covenant will I not BREAK nor ALTER [look at this, you that say God has 
  altered this Covenant so as to change, this Sabbath from the 7th to the 1st 
  day of the week.] the thing that has gone out of my mouth.&quot; Psl.139:34 Then it 
  is immutable unchangeable immortal! as well may man undertake to annihilate 
  the sun. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus then, as I have shown, came to 
  establish the new Covenant, and as I have before stated, he stripped off all 
  these appendages, the law of ceremonies, the hand writing of ordinances, the 
  carnal commandments (Paul,) from the first Covenant, the ten commandments, 
  leaving them pure as when they first came from his Father's hand, and nailed 
  as Paul shows to the Col.2:14 all these ceremonies to his cross, at the same 
  hour he sealed the new Covenant with his blood, called the everlasting 
  Covenant. Heb.13:20 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul in the 7 ch on this Covenant, 
  extracts from Jer.31:31-34, which shows us clearly what he means (see 8-12v,) 
  and says in the 7 v., if the first one had been faultless then no place could 
  be found for the second. 6 v. says this covenant is established on better 
  promises because Jesus is the mediator of it. 12:24 In 10:15,16, he quotes 
  from the 8 ch to show that the Holy Ghost is also a witness. See how, in ii. 
  Rom.13-16, &quot;when the Gentiles which have not the law, (that is the ten 
  commandments on tables of stone) do the things contained in the law (the ten 
  commandments) they show the work of the law (the ten commandments) written on 
  their hearts, their thoughts in the mean while accusing, or else excusing, 
  (when, Paul?) in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by my 
  gospel.&quot; Then it must be now. Oh no, says the reader, Paul means at the day of 
  judgment. - I am glad you admit that condemnation overtakes the transgressors 
  of the law written on our hearts somewhere. For proof that he means the 
  commandments read 21,22 v.; you will of course understand that it is not the 
  law of ceremonies, for these had been abolished more than 25 years before. See 
  chronology A.D. 60. Now see Heb.8:10 again. &quot;I will put MY laws into their 
  minds and write them in their hearts.&quot; This is the very same, the commandment, 
  the covenant, for there is no other law called God's law that we can refer to 
  in the Bible but this. In Jer.32:40, the everlasting covenant which Paul 
  quotes in 13 Heb. is the same promise as in Jer.31. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in Ezek.16:8 This is the first 
  covenant to Moses; that it is broken see 59:60 - 62, shows the second covenant 
  as in Jer., read the history in the chapter. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ch 20:37, where the promise is, &quot;I 
  will bring you into the bond (or delivering, see margin,) of the covenant. At 
  first view it would appear as though here was another implied but I think the 
  preceding verses, particularly the 12th and 20th, show it to be the covenant 
  in which the Sabbath is included, or it may be the everlasting covenant of 
  redemption, given to Jesus just previous to the resurrection. Paul clearly 
  shows that there are but two covenants under the law in his allegory to the 
  Galatians 4:21 - 27, and these two must of necessity, as I have shown embrace 
  the ten commandments. Now has this new covenant been broken by man as was the 
  first? Hear Isaiah; &quot;Behold the Lord maketh the earth empty, the inhabitants 
  of the earth burned, and but few left.&quot; Why? &quot;Because they have broken the 
  everlasting covenant.&quot; See 23:5 Read this whole chapter. Paul says that the 
  professed church in the last days will be covenant breakers. 2Tim.3:2 - 5 (Macknight's 
  translation.) This must of course be violating, especially, the fourth 
  commandment, the Lord's Sabbath. It would be the height of absurdity to 
  attempt to apply it to the first day of the week, because this is included in 
  the six working days, which God never sanctified nor set apart for an holy 
  day. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what is to be appended to this 
  everlasting covenant (called new not in respect of its date; it being made 
  from everlasting, and will continue forever,) to ensure us an entrance into 
  the gates of the holy city. Answer. The testimony of Jesus. Rev.12:17 &quot;That 
  old dragon the devil is pursuing the remnant (the last end) of God's children, 
  which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; 
  In the 14:12, John says the faith of Jesus, (same meaning.) Now what is this 
  faith or &quot;testimony of Jesus?&quot; John shows that he was banished to Patmos for 
  the &quot;word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; Rev.1,9, he says he &quot;bore 
  record of the testimony of Jesus,&quot; &quot;and what he saw.&quot; 2 v. Just what Jesus had 
  directed his disciples to do. See Matt.28:19,20 &quot;Teach all nations to observe 
  all things whatsoever I have commanded you.&quot; This then is what makes the 
  covenant new, appending to it the teaching or testimony of Jesus, after the 
  ceremonial law had been &quot;Nailed to the cross.&quot; Here it is perfectly clear that 
  the everlasting covenant the ten commandments have undergone no change 
  whatever. Indeed it is impossible that the law of God could be changed; do you 
  say it is possible I may be mistaken? Then I will appeal to Jesus. He says &quot;it 
  is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one title of the law to fail.&quot; You 
  say this is no proof, for the law of God is the word taught in the old and new 
  testaments. See here then, in Matt.5:17,18 Is not this the same law as in Luke 
  16:17? Yes. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very well then, see next verse, here he 
  unhesitatingly calls them the commandments; for proof that he means the ten 
  commandments, read 21st verse, &quot;shall not kill,&quot; now 27th &quot;nor commit 
  adultery,&quot; then 33d, &quot;nor take God's name in vain.&quot; His exposition of them as 
  a whole is certainly as clear as this in Matt.22:35 - 40, reduced to two 
  precepts, love God, and love your neighbor, on these two hang all the law 
  (ceremonial) and the prophets. Don't you see then that if this law is taken 
  away, changed or abolished, that the prophets must fall with it, as certainly 
  as a building would if the foundation was swept away? The argument is clear 
  that the prophecies cannot be sustained without the law. Again, see Luke 10:25 
  - 28 The lawyer says, &quot;Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life?&quot; Jesus 
  &quot;said unto him what is written in the LAW? how readest thou?&quot; He begins and 
  quotes the two precepts (the essence of the ten commandments) given by the 
  Saviour in Matt.xxii Jesus says, &quot;thou hast answered RIGHT, this do and thou 
  shalt live.&quot; Is this a safe rule for us? Yes, if you can believe the Saviour. 
  I ask if it could be so if any of the law should fail? No, that would 
  undermine the foundation. Then I have not appealed to Jesus in vain. If all of 
  this does not convince you, just hear the Prophets. &quot;The good man's delight is 
  in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night.&quot; 
  Psl.1:1,2 &quot;The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.&quot; 19 &quot;The law 
  of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.&quot; 19:72 
  &quot;Great peace have they that love thy, law, and nothing shall offend them.&quot; 165 
  Does the changing of the law by the little horn bring peace? &quot;He that turneth 
  away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be an abomination. 
  Prov.28:9 Read this passage again. You that say the Lord is not so particular 
  about his law, whether we keep this day or that for a holy day. He says &quot;every 
  thing upon his day.&quot; &quot;Seal the law among my disciples.&quot; Isa,8:16 What for? &quot;It 
  will be bindings on them in the new heavens and the new earth.&quot; 66,22,23 &quot;To 
  the law and the testimony.&quot; 20 What can you prove by it if it is changed or 
  abolished? &quot;He will magnify the law and make it honorable.&quot; 42:21 How could he 
  do that if he was going to change or destroy it. &quot;The people in whose heart is 
  my law, fear ye not the reproach of men.&quot; 51:7 &quot;After those days saith the 
  Lord, I will put my laws in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.&quot; 
  Jer.31:33 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then we are certainly bound to obey 
  them. &quot;Her Priests have violated my law - and have put no difference between 
  the holy and profane - and have hid their eyes from my SABBATHS, and I am 
  profaned among them. Ezek.22:26 It is just so; we believe it, Lord. It is even 
  among them that say they are looking for Jesus daily. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear the Apostles. &quot;We establish the 
  law.&quot; Rom.3:31 &quot;The law is holy, just and good.&quot; What do you mean Paul? The 
  professed Christian world does not believe your testimony; they are teaching 
  that a certain part of this law was changed or abolished 25 years before you 
  made this assertion. See chronology. &quot;Love is the fulfilling of the law.&quot; 
  13:10 See Matt.7:12, and Gal.5:14 James says it is a perfect Royal law of 
  liberty.&quot; See page 26, ch. 1:25, and 2:8,9,10,12, and 4:2 This testimony is 
  also rejected as an absurdity, being no better than Paul's, 25 years out of 
  date, for they will have it that the 4th commandment, the Sabbath, was changed 
  at the Resurrection. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commandments of God mean the same as 
  the law. - &quot;All his commandments are sure, they are established forever and 
  ever.&quot; Who then can change the Sabbath? &quot;A good understanding have all they 
  that do his commandments.&quot; &quot;Blessed is the man that delighteth greatly in his 
  commandments.&quot; Ps.111 and 112 &quot;O let me not wander from thy commandments.&quot; 
  19:10, and 35 &quot;I will delight myself in thy commandments which I have loved.&quot; 
  47 &quot;Thy commandment is exceeding broad.&quot; 96 &quot;All thy commandments are truth.&quot; 
  151 Can it be proved that God ever altered or changed the truth? Yes, if it 
  can be proved that he changed the Sabbath. &quot;O that thou hadst harkened to my 
  commandments, then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the 
  waves of the sea. Isa.48:18 See Jesus' exposition and reference to the 
  commandments Matt.5:19, 15:3 - 6 We are told by those who can hardly bear a 
  contradiction, that the 5th commandment means Jesus for father, and New 
  Jerusalem for mother. Jesus shows it is our natural parents, and so does Paul 
  to the Eph.6:1 - 3 See also Matt.19:17 - 19, and 22:35 - 40, Mark 12:29 - 31, 
  John 13:34, 14:31, and 16:12 The last three quotations relate to his own 
  commandment. See John's testimony on this point. 1st John 2:4,7, 3:21,24 
  Rev.12:17, and 14:12 Now let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter, &quot;fear 
  God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man,&quot; &quot;Blessed 
  are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of 
  life and may enter in through the gates into the city.&quot; Rev.22:14, Ecc.12:13 
  Do you ask for the foundation for this mass of evidence? When Israel violated 
  the holy Sabbath of rest given in the beginning, Gen.2:2,3, 1John 2:7, the 
  Lord said unto Moses, how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 
  What are they, Lord? Answer, the seventh day Sabbath. See Exo.16:27 - 30 Now 
  if we trace the Bible through in relation to the Sabbath we shall learn that 
  the Lord's threatenings, judgments, and promises, are more than ten fold in 
  comparison with the other nine commandments. What is the reason for this? 
  Answer, the keeping of GOD'S SABBATH HOLY, GOD'S SANCTIFIES AND SAVES THE 
  SOUL! but the keeping of one, or all the other nine without it will not. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, dear reader, if you are still 
  undecided about the keeping of God's Sabbath, let me persuade you to read 
  these two pages over again, and settle in your mind what you will do with this 
  mass of testimony, directly from God; his Prophets; Jesus Christ and his 
  Apostles. Dare you say you are now `living by every word of God,' and yet 
  reject all this, with what other testimony is here presented to prove the 
  keeping of the seventh day Sabbath? Dare you run such a risk because the great 
  mass of professed believers in Christendom are doing so? Do you think you can 
  be saved by such a faith and practice? Your ministering spirit (if you yet 
  have one,) says no, no! utterly impossible! Then receive the truth in the love 
  of it. Do you perceive that the seventh day Sabbath is God's first law for 
  man? Gen.2:2,3, and the very last promise he ever made to man of a future 
  inheritance is based on the `doing of these commandments.' It would not help 
  your case at all if you could make out five thousand, instead of ten 
  commandments; for you would still have to include the ten to get them all. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a beautiful delineation the 119 
  Psalm is, of this wonderful prototype delivered by God to Moses at Mount 
  Sinai. The Commandments are rehearsed twenty-two times. The Law, twenty-three. 
  The Testimony twenty-three. The Statutes twenty-one. The Precepts twenty-two. 
  The Judgments twenty-two. The Word thirty-eight. All referring to the Ark of 
  the Covenant of God. See how perfectly David and Nehemiah links them together 
  with the Sabbath in the 19:Psl:7 - 9; Neh.9:13,14 `The Commandments, Law, 
  Testimony and Judgments, are true and righteous all together.' Proof - 
  Commandments and laws, Exo.16:28 - 30; Testimony, Exo.25:16; Isa.8:20; Word, 
  Exo.34:27; Mark 7:10,13; Statutes and Judgments, Deut.6:17,20; 10:13; 
  Lev.18:5; Precepts, Neh.9:13,14; Dan.9:5 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who believes that the person that 
  refrains from worshiping `idols or images,' will be saved for that? or because 
  he honors his father or mother? or because he is no murderer? or does not 
  commit adultery, or steal, or bear false witness, or covet, or not swear? 
  Thousands on thousands have conformed to some and even all the nine, that made 
  no pretensions to religion. We must keep the whole if we would be saved; 
  neither can we be saved by keeping the Sabbath alone. James says `If we fail 
  in one we are guilty of the whole.' God says `verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep 
  - that ye may know that I the Lord do SANCTIFY you.' Exo.31:13 Now I ask if 
  there is any wise men among us than can tell us how the soul is sanctified 
  unless he keeps the Sabbath HOLY. Ezekiel says the Sabbath was given that we 
  might know that the Lord SANCTIFIES. 20. Says the reader, what do you think 
  about those that have died in faith, keeping the first day Sabbath? Just as I 
  do of those that never heard the everlasting gospel at the hour of his 
  judgment. Look at the state of the world now, since they have rejected this 
  message, the answer is plain then that condemnation comes, when light or 
  present truth is presented and rejected. We may think our plea of ignorance 
  may excuse us now. But just think of that awful hour, that gathering storm 
  that is now clothing the moral world with darkness that may be felt. The sure 
  and certain precursor of that tremendous &quot;rush&quot; when God roars out of Zion, 
  and utters his voice from Jerusalem, preparatory to the sign of the Son of man 
  in heaven and the trump of the archangel and a great sound, with so much power 
  that earth and sea will reel, and rock, and rend; and cast forth the righteous 
  dead, and the living saints changed; all going up together to meet their 
  glorified Lord. No plea of ignorance will then answer our purpose; thoughts 
  then rushing through our minds with more than lightning speed, will touch 
  every point as on the magnetic telegraph, and show us where and when we 
  rejected the present truth. Good God help the honest ones to see it now, for 
  then it certainly will be forever too late. That God's holy Sabbath is a 
  present truth I have not a shadow of a doubt; that it is stamped with 
  immortality and will be present truth forever and ever, no mortal can dispute: 
  - It was established in Paradise without limitation. Gen.2:2,3 God says &quot;my 
  covenant will I not BREAK nor ALTER.&quot; Jesus has shown that not one title of 
  this covenant can be altered, and told his children (not the Jews only) how 
  they should pray about the Sabbath 36 years after his death. A little further 
  in the distance stands John the last of the disciples pointing ut to Paradise 
  for the commandments. After wading through a few years tribulation, in vision 
  he sees the new Jerusalem, the mother of us all, the Paradise restored, and 
  cries out &quot;blessed are they that DO (that practice) his commandments, they are 
  going into the city.&quot; There they will keep the Sabbath, without opposition, as 
  at the beginning. Isa.66:23, Heb.4:9 This looks just like God's work. Man has 
  undertaken to &quot;break and alter&quot; this law by changing the Sabbath. It would be 
  much easier for him to bail the ocean dry, and carry the water to Jupiter by 
  the spoonful; and sweep the thick clouds from the heavens in a thunder storm 
  with the wing of a raven. Who then can alter this covenant? Echo answers, who 
  can alter this covenant? </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now who cannot see clearly that the main 
  pillar and foundation of this Everlasting covenant is the ten commandments, 
  the law of God, the constitution of the Bible; for every nation, kindred, 
  tongue, and people, given first in Paradise, re-enacted with the nine 
  additional commandments, written on tables of stone by the finger of God on 
  mount Sinai, giving it the form of a statute, then delivered to Moses, broken 
  by the Jews, just as men break any law without destroying it? The same ten 
  commandments and laws, called by Paul the new or second and everlasting 
  covenant, confirmed by Jesus, and sealed with his own blood eighteen hundred 
  years ago, written in our minds and our hearts from one generation to another 
  to the present time, always understood when developed in the believer's 
  practicing and doing them, with the promise annexed that such obedience will 
  be rewarded by an entrance into the holy city. Rev.22:14 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in this covenant or ten commandments 
  God has given us a perpetual covenant, a sign forever, and this is the seventh 
  day Sabbath. See Exo.31:16 This may bear some comparison with the visions of 
  Ezekiel and John. &quot;Their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a 
  wheel.&quot; &quot;I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name.&quot; So with 
  the Sabbath it is the main and essential thing. It is clearly that if we keep 
  this holy as God has shown us, then we shall be SANCTIFIED. So we see a holy 
  sanctified soul cannot violate the commandments. But if we reject the light 
  and still persist in saying we will keep one of the working days holy which 
  God never sanctified nor set apart for us, &quot;how does the love of God dwell in 
  that soul?&quot; &quot;If ye love me keep my commandments.&quot; Now the history of God's 
  people for the last seven years, or more, is described by John in Rev.14:6 - 
  13 An angel preaching the everlasting gospel at the hour of God's judgment. 
  This without any doubt represents all those who were preaching the second 
  Advent doctrine since 1840. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this proclamation, there followed 
  another angel, saying &quot;Babylon is fallen, is fallen.&quot; This angel was some of 
  the same Advent lecturers, (for invisible angels don't preach to men.) And the 
  angel follows them, showing the curse that befell all such as &quot;worship the 
  beast or his image, or receive his mark,&quot; that is, if they go back again. The 
  same angel or voice that is brought to view in ch.18:4, you see he follows the 
  one that announces the fall of Babylon, and cries, &quot;come out of her my people. 
  This was a little before and during a cry at Midnight in the fall of 1844. And 
  God's people did respond to that call and come out, does any one ask where 
  from? Answer, the professed churches and nowhere else. These churches then are 
  Babylon! Now when this cry ended, John describes another very different 
  company, in their patience, (or trying time,) keeping the commandments of God 
  and the faith or testimony of Jesus; who are they? Why, the very same that 
  came out of Babylon. Well, were they not all good Christians that obeyed and 
  came out of Babylon? They will be if they belong to this last company and pass 
  through the trial. But did they not keep the commandments of God before this 
  company was developed? Yes all but the 4th commandment. Therefore as I have 
  shown, John gave us no credit for keeping the first for the seventh day 
  Sabbath, neither could it be called keeping the commandments, for if we did it 
  ever so ignorantly, even, we still violated the very essential law in the 
  commandments, and all that John could say therefore was, that them which had 
  the mark of the beast kept some of the commandments. James says &quot;if we fail in 
  one we are guilty of the whole.&quot; Now that such a people can be found on the 
  earth as described in the 12 v. and have been uniting in companies for the 
  last two years, on the commandments of God and faith or testimony of Jesus, is 
  indisputable and clear. I say here then is demonstrated proof that Babylon has 
  fallen, and whoever undertakes to prove the contrary must annihilate this 
  people, or &quot;pervert the scriptures.&quot; John further shows that this is a remnant 
  (which of course means the last end) made war with, (his meaning is clear,) 
  for &quot;keeping the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; 12:17 
  Here another question arises, why this people should be persecuted for keeping 
  the commandments, &amp;c., when all, even them which have the mark of the beast, 
  profess to keep them. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose all that enrages the Devil and 
  his army is this; that this remnant are actually practicing what they believe 
  is the testimony of God and the testimony of Jesus, selling what they have, 
  giving alms, laying up their treasure in heaven, casting themselves entirely 
  loose from this wicked world; doing as their master told them to do, &quot;washing 
  one another's feet,&quot; and as the apostles have taught, `greet all the brethren 
  with an holy kiss,' salute every saint in Christ Jesus.' Living `by every word 
  which proceedeth out of the mouth of God,' practice keeping the Sabbath holy, 
  just as God has told them in the commandments. But says the reader, there are 
  tens of thousands that are looking for Jesus, that don't believe the above 
  doctrines, what will become of them? Consult John, he knows better than we do; 
  he has only described two companies. See 14:9 - 11,12 One is keeping the 
  commandments and faith of Jesus. The other has the mark of the beast. How? See 
  page 45 Is it not clear that the first day of the week for the Sabbath or holy 
  day is a mark of the beast. It surely will be admitted that the Devil was and 
  is the father of all the wicked deeds of Imperial and Papal Rome. It is clear 
  then from this history that Sunday, or first day, is his Sabbath throughout 
  Christendom. And that he has succeeded among other civilized nations to 
  sanctify and set apart for holy days every working day which God gave us, that 
  he did not sanctify. See page 8th. He will be very careful therefore not to 
  make war on any but those who keep God's Sabbath holy. Contrast this with page 
  30 John shows that these will all be judged according to their works, or as 
  their work shall be. But them that DO (that practice) his commandments may 
  enter in through the gates into the city. But do not some of the rest go in? 
  He does not say they do. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says his reward is with him to give 
  to every man according as his work shall be. Well, who are left out? See 15 v. 
  &quot;And whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.&quot; Now see 1John2:4 &quot;He that saith I 
  know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar.&quot; But does not the Rev.7:9 
  describe a great multitude saved after the 144,000? Yes, but I conclude that 
  these were raised from the dead. The original design of sending out this work 
  was to show that these commandments, the keeping of the Lord's Sabbath, would 
  save the living saints only at the coming of Jesus. Now that the keeping of 
  the seventh day Sabbath has been made void by the working of Satan, and is to 
  be restored as one of the all things spoken of by all the holy prophets since 
  the world began, before Jesus can come, is evident. See Acts 3:20,21 &quot;And they 
  that shall be of THEE shall build the old waste places - thou shalt raise up 
  the foundation of many generations, and thou shalt be called the REPAIRER of 
  the breach, the RESTORER of paths to dwell in. Isa.58:12 The two following 
  verses show that keeping or restoring the Sabbath is the special work. Jesus 
  says, &quot;they shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven, that do and teach 
  the commandments.&quot; That there will yet be a mighty struggle about the 
  restoring and keeping the seventh day Sabbath, that will test every living 
  soul that enters the gates of the city, cannot be disputed. It is evident the 
  Devil is making war on all such. See Rev.12:17 &quot;Remember the Sabbath day and 
  keep it holy.&quot; Amen. </p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>WHO ARE THE TRUE ISRAEL? </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 31 ch. of Exod., God says 
  &quot;wherefore the children of ISRAEL shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the 
  Sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant; it is a sign 
  between me and the children of Israel forever. 16,17 v. Who are the true 
  Israelites? Answer, God's people. Hear Paul: &quot;Is he the God of the Jews only? 
  Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes of the Gentiles, also; from uncircumcision 
  through faith&quot; Rom.3:29,30 God gave his re-enacted commandment or covenant to 
  the natural Jew in B.C.1491 They broke this covenant, as he told Moses they 
  would, for which he partially destroyed and dispersed them; God then brought 
  in a new covenant which continued the sign of the Sabbath, which was confirmed 
  by Jesus and his Apostle about 1525 years from the first. See Heb.8:8,10,13; 
  Rom.1;15 Their breaking the first covenant never could destroy the 
  commandments of God. Therefore this new or second covenant, made with the 
  house of ISRAEL, Heb.8:10, (not the natural Jew only.) is indelibly written 
  upon the heart. Now every child takes the name of his parents. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us see what the angel Gabriel says 
  to Mary concerning her son: &quot;The Lord God will give him the throne of David 
  his father, and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever.&quot; Luke 1:31,33
  </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the prophecy: &quot;There shall come a 
  star out of Jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel.&quot; Num. Now 1735 years 
  before Jesus was born, God changed Jacob's name to Israel, because he 
  prevailed with him. This then is the family name for all who overcome or 
  prevail. God gave this name to his spiritual child, namely, Israel. Then Jesus 
  will &quot;reign over the house of Israel forever.&quot; This must include all that are 
  saved in the everlasting kingdom. Further, Joseph was the natural son of 
  Jacob, or Israel. In his prophetic view and dying testimony to his children, 
  he says, Joseph is a fruitful bough, from thence is the shepherd the stone of 
  Israel. Gen.49:22 - 34 Then this Shepherd (Jesus) is a descendant, and is of 
  the house of Israel. Does he not say that he is the Shepherd of the Sheep? - 
  What, of the Jews only? No, but also of the Gentile, &quot;for the promise is not 
  through the law (of ceremonies) but through the righteousness of faith, 
  Rom.4:13 Micah says, &quot;they shall smite the Judge of Israel, that is to be the 
  ruler of Israel. 5:1,2 Now Jesus never was a judge nor ruler in Israel. This, 
  then, is a prophecy in the future, that he will judge, and be the Ruler over, 
  the whole house of Israel. All the family, both natural Jew and Gentile, will 
  assume the family name, the whole Israel of God. The angel Gabriel's message, 
  then, is clear; David is the father of Jesus, according to the flesh, and 
  Jacob, or rather Israel his father, and Jesus reigns over the house of Israel 
  forever. Paul says, &quot;He is not a Jew which is one outwardly but he is a Jew 
  which is one inwardly.&quot; Rom.2 &quot;There is no difference between the Jew and 
  Greek, (or Gentiles) for they are not all Israel that are of Israel, neither 
  because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children.&quot; Why? Because the 
  children of the promise, of Isaac (is the true seed.) chs. 9 and 10. To the 
  Galatians he says, &quot;now to Abraham (the Grandfather of Israel) and his seed 
  were the promises made; not to many, but as of one and to thy seed which is 
  CHRIST - then says, there is neither Jew nor Greek - but one in Christ Jesus, 
  and if ye be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the 
  promise.&quot; 3 &quot;And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and 
  mercy, and upon the ISRAEL of God.&quot; 6 This, then, is the name of the whole 
  family in heaven; Christ is God's only son and lawful heir, none but the true 
  seed can be joint heirs with Christ in the covenant made with Abraham. 
  Ezekiel's prophecy in 37 ch., God says &quot;he will bring up out of their graves 
  the whole house of Israel.&quot; &quot;and I will put my spirit in you and ye shall 
  live.&quot; 17-14 If God here means any other than the spiritual Israel, then 
  Universalism is true - for the whole house of natural Israel did not die in 
  faith; if the wicked Jews are to be raised and live before God, then will all 
  the wicked! For God is not respecter of persons; &quot;And the heathen shall know 
  that I the Lord do sanctify Israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of 
  them forevermore.&quot; 28v. Here, then, we prove that the dead and living saints 
  are the whole Israel of God, and the Covenant and Sign is binding on them into 
  the gates of the holy city. Rev.20:14 </p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>TWO QUESTIONS FOR SHEPHERDS AND PRINCIPALS </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>OF THE FLOCK, ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE. </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When and where has God abolished his 
  commandments and laws namely the seventh day Sabbath as recorded in Exo.16:28 
  - 30? When, and where did God ever sanctify the first, or any other day but 
  the seventh to be kept for a holy day of rest? Will God ever justify any 
  living soul for attempting to keep one of the six working days holy? </p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><b>RECAPITULATION </b></p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Page 5. When was the Sabbath 
  instituted? Here we have endeavored to show when, and how it continued until 
  its re-enactment on Mount Sinai. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Page 11. Has the Sabbath been 
  abolished since the seventh day of creation? If so, when. and where is the 
  proof? Here we believe we have adduced incontestable proof from the 
  Scriptures; from the two separate codes of laws given, viz: the first on 
  tables of stone, called by God, prophets, Jesus, and his Apostle. 3. The 
  commandments of God. 2d code, the Book of Moses, as written from the mouth of 
  God, the book of ceremonies, combining ecclesiastical and civil law, which 
  Paul shows was nailed to the cross with all their Sabbaths as carnal 
  commandments, (the law of ceremonies,) because their feasts commenced and 
  ended with a Sabbath. See Lev.23 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please read from 20th page onward, how 
  Jesus and the Apostle make the distinction. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Page 31. Was the seventh day Sabbath 
  ever changed? If so, when, and for what reason? Here we find, by examining the 
  proofs set forth by those who favor and insist upon the change, that there is 
  not one passage of Scripture in the Bible to sustain it, but to the contrary, 
  that Jesus kept it and gave directions about it at the destruction of 
  Jerusalem. Paul also, and other Apostles taught how we were to keep the 
  commandments. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Page 45. The History which is 
  uncontroverted. </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The time when the Sabbath commences. 
  See pages 35 and 36, not 31, as on page 46 The sun in the centre of the globe, 
  at the commencement of the sacred year (March or April) is the great regulator 
  or time-keeper for every living soul on this planet. Gen.1:14, Exo.12:2 </p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Page 49 begins with the covenants. 
  Here by tracing them through the Bible we find them founded on the ten 
  commandments. The Sabbath of the Lord our God, the connecting link, or 
  covenant within the covenant; the first law ever given, annexed to the last 
  promise ever made, which if obeyed will save them that are alive when Jesus 
  comes . . .* Sabbath HOLY. </p>
