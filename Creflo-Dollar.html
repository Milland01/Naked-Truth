          ordinary sense; but spec. used (in the plur. thus, esp. with the art.) 
          of the supreme God; <u>occasionally applied by way of deference to 
          magistrates</u>; and sometimes as a superlative:--angels, X exceeding, 
          God (gods) (-dess, -ly), X (very) great, judges, X mighty.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left">In context, Psalm 82 is addressed to the magistrates, 
        the judges of Israel, and that is the intended meaning of the word in 
        verse 6. Another similar use of the word is found in Exodus 21:6.</td>

      Jesus came as a man, that's why it was <i>legal</i> to anoint him. God 
      doesn't need anointing, He <i>is</i> anointing. Jesus came as a <i>man</i>, 
      and at age 30 God is now getting ready to demonstrate to us, and give us 
      an example of what a <i>man</i>, <i>with the anointing,</i> can do.&nbsp;

      perfection. You know Jesus, in one scripture in the Bible he went on a 
      journey, and he was tired. You better hope God don't get tired. Isaiah 50 
      says, 50, 60, somewhere, says where we have a God who fainteth not, 
      neither is weary (Isa. 40:28). But Jesus did, if he came as God and he got 
      tired, he says he sat down by the well 'cause he was tired. Boy we're in 
      trouble. And somebody said, well, <i><b>Jesus came as God</b></i>. Well 
      how many of you know the Bible says God <b>never </b><i><b>sleeps</b>,</i> 
      nor slumbers. And yet in the book of Mark we see Jesus <i>asleep</i> in 
      the back of the boat. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What fantasy preachers is he talking about? I know of no Christian 
  denomination that teaches that Jesus was God only - and NOT <i>also</i> man. 
  He seems to imply that this false teaching is widespread and deceiving many. 
  Who has taught this false doctrine about Jesus that deceived Creflo Dollar, or 
  anyone else? What Christian preachers have taught anything other than Jesus 
  was the God-man, fully God and fully man? He did not say. Not once did he 
  explain that Jesus, while still fully God, did not always exercise His divine 
  powers, but rather chose to experience our human frailties with us. Setting 
  aside His divine power, but not His divinity, Jesus tired, slept, got hungry, 
  and experienced the pain of suffering of dieing on the cross at the hands of 
  fellow men. That IS the teaching of all Christian denominations that I know 
  of, yet in his sermon Creflo Dollar seemed to reject this, apparently 
  determined to deny the deity of Jesus Christ. However, currently on his web 
  site in the section on <a href="http://interactive.creflodollarministries.org/bible/christfund_t.asp">Christian Fundamentals</a>, 
  he does briefly mention the Trinity, so Creflo Dollar apparently does believe 
  in the deity of Jesus Christ, despite what he says, and the impression he 
  gives in the above sermon.</p>
