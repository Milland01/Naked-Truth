<center><font size="5"><b>Keeping Every Day Holy<br>
Versus<br>
Government Decrees on Keeping a Sunday Sabbath.</b></font></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should keep all days holy in the Christian
    dispensation. But inasmuch as the law of the land has marked out a certain
    day—Sunday—as the particular day of rest, we should obey the law of the
    land and keep Sunday.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Sabbath objection grows out of a predicament.
  Different groups in the Sundaykeeping ranks of Christendom have different way
  of trying to avoid the straight command of God to keep holy &quot;the seventh
  day.&quot; One group, frank enough to admit that the New Testament contains no
  such command to transfer the Sabbath to Sunday, has attempted to escape the
  Sabbath obligation by declaring that in the Christian dispensation all days
  are alike holy, and because of this there need not be given to the Sabbath day
  any particular veneration over any other day.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who claimed merely that all days were holy thought
  that they were solving the difficulty in simple fashion. But in actual
  practice their solution does not work so well. If all days are holy, then one
  day is no better than another, and why should we do special honor to any day
  [Sunday for example] by centering our religious services on that day? Thus men
  could reason. In other words, the whole idea of the Sabbath would vanish out
  of the minds of men because it had lost its definiteness.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how was definiteness to be introduced without
  surrendering the whole argument? Why, by the simple expedient of invoking the
  scripture that declares we should be subject to the civil government, and then
  calling attention to the fact that there is a civil statute requiring rest
  from labor on a certain day of the week, Sunday. Thus by a wide detour this
  group of Sundaykeepers reach their desired day without apparently laying
  themselves open to the troublesome necessity of trying to prove that the day
  was changed to Sunday by the New Testament writers<b>—</b>a theological [pg.
  252] feat that they have observed other Sundaykeepers unable to accomplish.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to know just where to begin in answering such a
  fallacy as this, for every main statement of it is incorrect. Take the claim
  that all days are alike holy. Is it not asking a little too much of the
  Sabbath defender to expect him to meet the Sunday challenger from two opposite
  sides at the same time? Must we be expected to demolish with one stroke the
  claim that the Sabbath was transferred to the first day of the week and the
  contention that is was transferred to all the seven days of the week? Might we
  not be pardoned for demanding that Sundaykeepers first agree among themselves
  as to just <i>what </i>claim they will make for Sunday before asking the
  Sabbathkeeper to answer them?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us examine the claim that we should keep a certain
  day because the government so decrees. True, the Bible says we should be
  subject to the civil power. But where do we read that we should guide our
  religious lives by the statutes of civil government? (Rather, we read the
  contrary. Acts 5:29) If we ought so to guide ourselves, then our religion
  would change whenever we moved to a new land, and one so unfortunate as to
  live in a pagan land would find himself keeping holy certain days set apart
  for pagan gods. Into what desperate situations does false logic bring us!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us take the matter a little further. How do we
  happen to have Sunday laws on the statute books of various so-called Christian
  governments? Because certain militant Sundaykeepers who believed the Sabbath
  had been definitely changed to the first day of the week persuaded
  legislatures to enact a law setting aside that particular day. And now,
  incredible though it be, those who declare that <i>all </i>days are like holy
  come urging <i>Sunday</i> sacredness because of a civil statute that was
  passed at the behest of those who declare that the Sabbath was transferred to
  the first day of the week.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could paradox be greater? Is it really possible to tell
  just what such people believe?</p>
