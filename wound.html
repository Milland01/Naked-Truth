  <p><i>November 15, 2002</i></p>
  <p><b>Excerpt from an article by NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press:</b></p>
  <p>ROME--Pope John Paul II made a historic speech to Italy's parliament 
  Thursday, urging Italians to work for world peace, uphold their Christian 
  values and have more babies.</p>
  <p>The visit--the first time a pope has appeared before the Italian 
  parliament--underscored the warmth that the country feels for the Polish-born 
  John Paul, the first non-Italian pontiff in 455 years.</p>
  <p>It also showed Italy and the Roman Catholic Church have healed wounds that 
  a century ago prompted popes to call themselves ''prisoners'' of the Vatican 
  rather than accept Italy's government as legitimate.</p>
