  <title>Mark Of The Beast In Daniel 8-12.</title>

<p align="center"><b><font size="6">The Mark Of The Beast In Daniel 8 -
12<br>
</font><font size="5">(Dan 11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of
the north shall trouble him:)</font></b></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:25 And he [the little horn] shall speak great words
against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High,
and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his
hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Daniel 7 repeats the empires theme of Daniel 2 and enlarges on the
information on the divided Roman Empire by providing more details&nbsp;
According to Daniel 7, the little horn power arises after the fall and
division of the Roman Empire as represented by the 10 horns, which are
introduced in Daniel 2 as the 10 toes of the statue. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The book of Daniel is unsealed in the revelation to John, and
carries us forward to the last scenes of this earth’s history. {18MR
15.3}</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The book of Daniel is understood or unsealed when the book of
Revelation is applied to it. Note that there are two specific points
that the little horn thinks he can change, the times and laws of the
most High. </p>
  <p><u><b>THE TIMES OF THE MOST HIGH</b></u></p>
  <blockquote>Acts 1:7 (KJV) And he said unto them, <span
 style="color: red;">It is not for you to know the <b>times</b> or the
seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</span></blockquote>
  <p> </p>
The times that Jesus refers to here are the prophetic times that have
the date of their fulfilment set by the Father. This, as we shall see,
is the way "times" should be understood in Dan. 7:25. We will now apply
the book of Revelation to Dan. 7:25 to unseal it.
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <u><b><font size="4">REVELATION 12</font></b></u>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed [Dan. 11:44], which keep the
commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In Revelation 12 there are also two specific points that
distinguish the true end time church,&nbsp; they keep the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ, which incurs the wrath
of Satan. These are the exact same two points mentioned in Daniel 7.
The law in Daniel 7:25 equates with the commandments of God in
Revelation 12:17. The times in Daniel 7:25 equates with the testimony
of Jesus Christ in Revelation 12:17, which is further defined in
Revelation 19:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said
unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy
brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">REVELATION 14</font></b></u></p>
  <p>So the times in Daniel 7:25 equates with the spirit of prophecy,
which is to say prophetic times. Laws in Daniel 7:25 equates with the
commandments of God in Revelation 12:17. These same two points are even
further defined in Revelation 14:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
Rev 14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
    <b> the hour of his judgment</b> is come: and <b>worship him that
made heaven, and earth, and the sea (See Exo. 20:11), </b>and the
fountains of waters.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We now can see that "times and laws" in Daniel 7:25 explicitly
refers to the prophetic time of judgment, and the Sabbath, the fourth
commandment (Exo. 20:11), and these are proclaimed as the everlasting
gospel. These two points are also found paired together here:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary:
I am the LORD.</p>
    <p>Lev 26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary:
I am the LORD.</p>
    <p>Ezek 23:38 Moreover this they have done unto me: they have
defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">DANIEL 8</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Daniel 8 is a vision that repeats and enlarges on the vision of
Daniel 7, where we now know the little horn thinks to change the
prophetic time of judgment (times) and the seventh day Sabbath (laws),
so we should expect to find these two points in Daniel 8 too. The first
is easy to find:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Investigative Judgment which began at the conclusion of the
2300 days (1844) is the prophetic time of Daniel 7:25 that the little
horn denies and thinks to change in an effort to obscure it. The
sanctuary and the day of atonement illustrate the present truth
ministry of Christ our high priest in the process of dealing with the
sins of His people. How has this been obscured and changed?</p>
  <p>To begin with, the little horn in Daniel is said in the Catholic <i>
  <a

Rheims Bible</a></i> to be Antiochus IV Epiphanes, and the 2300 days
are said to be the 6 years and about 4 months of persecution that ended
with his death. This interpretation rejects the day for a year
principle which establishes the associated 70 week prophecy in Daniel
chapter 9 as 490 years, which the note in the <a

  <i>Douay Rheims</i> accepts</a>. But there is another way the work of
atonement by Christ our high priest in the heavenly sanctuary is
obscured.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b><u>Pope Tells Catholics Not To Seek Forgiveness
Directly From God!</u></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>28. ... It is good to renew and reaffirm this faith at a
moment when it might be weakening, losing something of its completeness
or entering into an area of shadow and silence, threatened as it is by
the negative elements of the above-mentioned crisis. For the sacrament
of confession is indeed being undermined, on the one hand by the
obscuring of the mortal and religious conscience, the lessening of a
sense of sin, the distortion of the concept of repentance and the lack
of effort to live an authentically Christian life. And on the other
hand, it is being <b> undermined by the sometimes widespread idea that
one can obtain forgiveness directly from God, even in a habitual way,
without approaching the sacrament of reconciliation. </b>A further
negative influence is the routine of a sacramental practice sometimes
lacking in fervor and real spontaneity, deriving perhaps from a
mistaken and distorted idea of the effects of the sacrament.</p>

    <b>RECONCILIATION AND PENANCE</b></a></i>, dated December 2nd, 1984.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Pope is saying that a Catholic <i><b>must</b> </i>seek out a
priest to confess their sins and ask forgiveness <b><i>only through
the priest,</i></b><i><b> </b></i>and that this "sacrament" of
confession / penance is undermined by those who think they can approach
God directly for forgiveness. This makes the Catholic priest essential
in the process of salvation, since he stands in the place of God, as
another mediator between man and God. This is not a novel teaching in
the Catholic Church, is has a long history:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Leo the Great (440-461) writes: "God in His
abundant mercy has provided two remedies for the sins of men; that they
may gain eternal life by the grace of Baptism, and also by the remedy
of Penance. Those who have violated the vows of their Baptism may
obtain the remission of their sins by condemning themselves; the divine
goodness has so decreed that [pg. 284] <b> the pardon of God can only
be obtained by sinners through the prayers of the priests</b>. Jesus
Christ Himself has conferred upon the rulers of the Church the power of
imposing canonical penance upon sinners who confess their sins, and of
allowing them to receive the Sacraments of Christ, after they have
purified their souls by a salutary satisfaction. . . . " (<a
 href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3604108.htm"><i>Epis</i>. cviii.</a>).
[Emphasis supplied]</p>

Bertrand L. Conway, Copyright 1929 by "The Missionary Society of St.
Paul the Apostle, New York, published by The Paulist Press, 401 West
59th Street, New York, pages 283-284.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note what scripture says about confessing our sins to God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is
passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
profession.<br>
Heb 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as
we are, yet without sin.<br>
Heb 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
    <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and <b>one mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus</b>;</p>
    <p>1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,
we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
Son cleanseth us from all sin.<br>
1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
truth is not in us.<br>
1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>
1 John 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and
his word is not in us.<br>
1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye
sin not. And <b>if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous:</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In Matt 9:2-6, Mark 2:5-12, and Luke 5:18-25 Christ publicly
forgives a man's sins, and the scribes and Pharisees thinking Christ a
mere man, accuse Him of blasphemy, because as they reasoned: Who can
forgive sins, but God alone? Claiming to be able to forgive a man's
sins is called blasphemy, it is something only God can do.</p>
  <p>The Catholic teaching cited above is clearly in direct opposition
to scripture.<br>
This leaves the 4th commandment to be found in Daniel 8.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the
host, and by him the daily <i>sacrifice</i> was taken away, and the
place of his sanctuary was cast down.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that in verse 11 we again have two points, the daily and the
sanctuary. As we have seen previously, the parallel to times in Daniel
7:25&nbsp; is the cleansing of the sanctuary after 2300 days (years) in
verse 14, the judgment on the day of atonement. So for the parallel to
laws in Daniel 7:25, let's now examine the daily. The word translated
daily [<a
 href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8548&amp;Version=KJV">H8548</a>
- tamiyd] can also have the meaning <u>perpetual</u> (<a
 href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/search/translationResults.cfm?Strongs=H8548&amp;Criteria=perpetual&amp;Version=KJV">Exo.
30:8</a>,&nbsp; <a
 href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/search/translationResults.cfm?Strongs=H8548&amp;Criteria=perpetual&amp;Version=KJV">
Lev. 6:20</a>). The word <i>sacrifice</i> in the above verse is
supplied by the translators, it is not in the original text and should
be ignored.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the
host, and by him the <strike>daily</strike> [perpetual] <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike>
was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.<br>
Dan 8:12 And an host was given him against the <strike>daily</strike>
[perpetual] <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike> by reason of
transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practiced, and prospered.<br>
Dan 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning
the <strike>daily</strike> [perpetual] <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike>,
and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the
host to be trodden under foot?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We can see above that the daily / perpetual is taken away and
replaced by what is called the transgression of desolation. What truth
is cast to the ground by the transgression?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
and thy law is the truth.</p>
    <p>1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law:
for sin is the transgression of the law.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly the transgression of desolation involves transgressing the
law of God. If we use the definition of perpetual instead of daily,
does that lead us to the Sabbath? Yes it does!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the
sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for <b>a
perpetual covenant.</b><br>
Exo 31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day
he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The word tamid in Daniel 8, 11, and 12 should be translated as
perpetual, referring to the perpetual covenant of the Sabbath
commandment. The transgression which replaces the perpetual covenant
and results in desolation is also mentioned in Isaiah.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 24:1 Behold, the LORD <b>maketh the earth empty</b>, and
maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
inhabitants thereof.<br>
Isa 24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her
mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so
with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of
usury to him.<br>
Isa 24:3 The land shall be <b>utterly emptied</b>, and utterly
spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.<br>
Isa 24:4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.<br>
Isa 24:5 <b>The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken
the everlasting covenant.</b><br>
Isa 24:6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
dwell therein are <b>desolate</b>: therefore the inhabitants of the
earth are burned, and few men left.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the mark of the beast, the little horn, is indeed found in
Daniel 8, it is the transgression of desolation. It is also the
abomination that maketh desolate in Daniel 11:31 and Daniel 12:11 and
the abomination of desolation in Matthew 24:15 and Mark 13:14.</p>
  <p><u><b>THE SEAL OF GOD</b></u></p>
  <p>If we also now apply the refined definitions of "times and laws"
of Dan 7:25 provided to us by Revelation 12:17, 14:7 and 19:10, and
read them into Isaiah 8, notice the result:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:16 Bind up the testimony (of Jesus, the spirit of
prophecy), <b>seal</b> the law (7th day Sabbath) among my disciples.<br>
...<br>
Isa 8:20 To the law (7th day Sabbath) and to the testimony (2300 day
prophecy / pre-advent judgment): if they speak not according to this
word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In conjunction with Exodus 31:16-17, this clearly confirms the 7th
day Sabbath to be the sign or seal of God, the perpetual <i>covenant</i>
of Daniel 8.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the very time in which we live, the Lord has called His
people and has given them a message to bear. He has called them to
expose the wickedness of the man of sin who has made the Sunday law a <span
 class="highlight"> distinctive</span> <span class="highlight">power</span>,
who has thought to change times and laws, and to oppress the people of
God who stand firmly to honor Him by keeping the only true Sabbath, the
Sabbath of creation, as holy unto the Lord. He has called them to bear
the sign of God, to exalt the Lord in keeping holy His law; for it is a
transcript of His character. No part of the law of God and their
covenant obligation to keep that law holy is to lose its binding claims
upon all the world. Those who have had the light upon keeping the law
of Jehovah are to stand firmly in the faith, and to make that light
shine forth in clear, distinct rays. <span class="reference">{18MR
33.1}</span></p>
