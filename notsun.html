<blockquote>
  <p>This article is intended for those who may think that Sunday is
the seventh day, or sabbath day, that the Bible designates to be set
aside for the worship of God. It is quite surprising how many people
actually think this. They generally assume that since Saturday and
Sunday are the "weekend", that Monday must be the first day of the week
because it is their first work day of the week. Today, confusion on
this point is compounded by the practice, particularly in Europe for
the last thirty years, of arranging calendars with Monday as the first
day, and Sunday as the seventh day of the week (<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_by_country">See
Date and Time by Country</a>). This would then lead you to believe that
Sunday is indeed the seventh day sabbath.</p>
	<p>Also contributing somewhat to the confusion is that the numbering of the 
	Ten Commandments is not uniform. Flavius Josephus, a Jewish Historian of the 
	1st century, listed the Sabbath Commandment as the fourth*, while the
	<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04153a.htm">Catholics</a> and 
	Lutherans consider it to be the 3rd Commandment, as numbered in the 5th 
	century by St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430 A.D).</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">*5. The first commandment teaches us that there 
	is but one God, and that we ought to worship him only. The second commands 
	us not to make the image of any living creature to worship it. The third, 
	that we must not swear by God in a false matter. The fourth, that we must 
	keep the seventh day, by resting from all sorts of work. The fifth, that we 
	must honor our parents. The sixth that we must abstain from murder. The 
	seventh that we must not commit adultery. The eighth, that we must not be 
	guilty of theft. The ninth, that we must not bear false witness. The tenth, 
	that we must not admit of the desire of any thing that is another's. &mdash;

  <p>Reading the following papal encyclical, you may even think that
Sunday is the Sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><i>Making Sunday Holy</i></p>
    <p>248. Allied to what We have said so far is the question of the
Sunday rest.</p>
    <p>249. To safeguard man's dignity as a creature of God endowed
with a soul in the image and likeness of God, the Church has always
demanded a diligent observance of the third Commandment: "Remember that
thou keep holy the sabbath day." (52) God certainly has the right and
power to command man to devote one day a week to his duty of
worshipping the eternal Majesty. Free from mundane cares, he should
lift up his mind to the things of heaven, and look into the depths of
his conscience, to see how he stands with God in respect of those
necessary and inviolable relationships which must exist between the
creature and his Creator.</p>
    <p>250. In addition, man has a right to rest a while from work, and
indeed a need to do so if he is to renew his bodily strength and to
refresh his spirit by suitable recreation. He has also to think of his
family, the unity of which depends so much on frequent contact and the
peaceful living together of all its members.</p>
    <p>251. Thus, religion and moral and physical well-being are one in
demanding this periodic rest, and for many centuries now the Church has
set aside Sunday as a special day of rest for the faithful, on which
they participate in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, the memorial and
application of Christ's redemptive work for souls.</p>
    <font face="Times" size="3">
    <p>252. Heavy in heart, We cannot but deplore the growing tendency
in certain quarters to disregard this sacred law, if not to reject it
outright. This attitude must inevitably impair the bodily and spiritual
health of the workers, whose welfare We have so much at heart. </p>
    <p>253. In the name of God, therefore, and for the sake of the
material and spiritual interests of men, We call upon all, public
authorities, employers and workers, to observe the precepts of God and
His Church and to remember their grave responsibilities before God and
society. </p>

  <p>Some Catholic Catechisms will even give one the impression that
Sunday is the sabbath. The following quotation is from the Catholic <em>Baltimore
Catechism</em> #1, popular in the United States for the last century or
so, intended for the instruction of children. It blurs the distinction
between the Sabbath and Sunday:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Q. What is the third Commandment?</b><br>
A. The third Commandment is: Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day.</p>
    <p><b>Q. How are we to worship God on Sundays and holydays of
obligation?</b><br>
A. We are to worship God on Sundays and holydays of obligation by
hearing Mass, by prayer, and by other good works.</p>

Poor Man's Catechism: or The Christian Doctrine Explained</b></a></i>,
with short admonitions by John Mannock, O.S.B. Published in 1859 by
Edward Dunigan &amp; Brother, James B. Kirker, 371 Broadway, New York,
pages 112, 113.</p>
  <p>Note the abbreviation of the Sabbath commandment in each of the
above catechisms which declare that Sunday is the day to be kept holy.
But the commandment declares the seventh-day of the week (Saturday) to
be the Sabbath day, not Sunday the first day (See below Exo. 20:8-11).
Rather than explain how the church has changed a commandment of God,
some Catholic catechisms simply abbreviate the commandment, and then
teach erroneously that Sunday is the Sabbath day intended by the
commandment. Others attribute the change to the Apostles, or, in the
case of <i>The Poor Man's Catechism</i> cited above, boldly state that
God has Himself appointed Sunday to be Sabbath day.</p>
  <p>And then there are also some people who will suggest that somehow
we have lost track of the days of the week, and that today, no one can
be sure just what day is the seventh day of the week. Those who wish to
cling to this notion have never actually researched the issue to
discover the facts. So then, when was the sabbath begun? When was the
first sabbath observed, on which day, and who was it intended for?</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">The First Sabbath Keepers</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had
made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had
made.<br>
Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
that in it he had rested.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The very first sabbath was the <em>seventh</em> day of creation.
Look up Saturday in most any dictionary and it will tell you that it is
the seventh day of the week. So who observed the first sabbath day?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of
God created he him; male and female created he them.</p>
    <p>Gen 1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,
it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both Adam and Eve were created on the sixth day, before the
sabbath day, and so were present to observe the day of rest God created
for them. Some will try to claim that the sabbath was a Jewish
festival, part of the Mosaic law that was done away with at the cross.
Since sabbath was established at creation as a memorial of that event,
would that notion then make Adam and Eve Jews? Actually not a single
Jew existed until the covenant made with Abraham, thousands of years
later. The sabbath predates Jews!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 2:27 And he [Jesus] said unto them, The sabbath was made
for man, and not man for the sabbath:<br>
Mark 2:28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the seventh-day sabbath was created for Adam and Eve, and <em>all</em>
of humanity, not just for the Jews. Adam lived for 930 years (Gen 5:5),
and undoubtedly was a sabbath keeper his entire life. Adam was not the
only one of the first millennium to keep the sabbath. The same can be
said for Enoch, who was born within the lifetime of Adam. Enoch was so
in harmony with God that he was taken up to heaven and never died (Gen
5:24).</p>
  <p><i>Butler's Catechism, </i>previously cited<i>, </i>gives the
following information about the Sabbath later in a different section:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What divine traditions existed before
Moses wrote the first books of the Old Testament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The duty of sanctifying the Sabbath (<i>Gen</i>.
ii. 3); the prohibition of eating the blood of animals (<i>Gen</i>. ix.
4); the rite of circumcision (<i>Gen</i>. xvi. 10); and generally, the
whole history of religion before the time of Moses, during twenty-five
hundred years.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What traditions of the Christian religion existed
before the several books of the New Testament were promulgated or
written?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The substitution of the Sunday, as a holy day,
for the Sabbath, or Saturday; the abrogation of the necessity of
circumcision, and generally, the whole system of the Christian religion.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>So in this instance, a Catholic catechism not only admits the
change from the Sabbath to Sunday, but it even claims that it was the
duty of mankind to keep the Saturday Sabbath beginning with the seventh
day of creation!</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Sabbath Keeping After the
Flood.</font></b></u></p>
  <p>The Patriarch Abraham, who was born some 1000 years after the
death of Adam, and 300 years after the flood, can also be shown to have
kept the seventh-day sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my
charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly since Abraham kept God's laws he must also have faithfully
kept the seventh day sabbath of the Lord.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Moses and the Jews <em>Before</em>
Mount Sinai.</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="left">While Israel was captive in Egypt, Pharaoh was not
pleased with them, and gave this reason:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the
land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The word rest is H7673, shabath. The same word is
used in Genesis 2:2-3 with the seventh day of creation. Israel was
observing a sabbath rest in Egypt, and this angered Pharaoh who then
commanded them to also gather their own straw to make bricks, but the
quota of bricks was to remain the same. Pharaoh's attempt to force work
on Israel such that they could not rest on the sabbath, led to the
plagues falling on the Egyptians.</p>
  <p>After leaving Egypt, but before the commandments of God were given
on stone tablets atop mount Sinai, God had already shown Israel
precisely which day was His sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 16:23 And he [Moses] said unto them, This is that which the
LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Some may think that any old day will satisfy God, but the Lord
left no doubt about the day he wanted observed, he told Moses and the
Israelites exactly which day was the sabbath. For 40 years a double
portion of manna fell on Friday, and no manna fell on sabbath. Note
that this began BEFORE the Ten Commandments were given to Moses on
Sinai. The manna continued until the Israelites entered the promised
land (Exodus 16:35, Joshua 5:12). With 52 weeks a year, that means God
made the seventh day sabbath plain to them for over <em>2000</em>
weeks. It is a day that <em>does</em> matter to God.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Mount Sinai.</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Note that at Sinai the following was said with regard to the
sabbath-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy<br>
God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates:<br>
Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
    <p>Deu 5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of
Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a
mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God
commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When Moses came up on Sinai, God commanded that the Jews were to
REMEMBER the sabbath day. The sabbath was not first revealed to Israel
on Sinai, they were told to remember what they already knew in no
uncertain terms.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Will Just Any Seven Day Cycle
of Rest Satisfy God?</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="left">Some may ask, one day in seven? Well, why can't I
pick my seventh day? Sunday is more convenient for me, or perhaps
Monday, etc., so <em> that</em> will be my day of sabbath rest to the
Lord. I will keep every seventh day holy, but that day will be a day of
  <em>my choosing</em>. The notion that God allows one to pick their
seventh day has even been taught by Catholics:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><b>1157.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not God command us to
observe Saturday, and not Sunday at all?</b></p>
    <p align="left">No. The command as given by Moses in the Name of
God to the Jews was that the Sabbath, and not Saturday, should be kept
holy. The word Sabbath means rest. The law includes two elements; one
essential, that one day in seven should be dedicated to God; the other
ceremonial, that the particular day should be chosen. The Jews selected
Saturday. ...</p>
    <p align="left"><b>1159.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>...</p>
    <p align="left">... The Jews decided to observe Saturday, while
Christians decided to observe Sunday. The seventh day as God's day was
not changed. The Sabbath, God's rest day, was transferred from Saturday
to Sunday.</p>

  <p align="left">The problem with the choosing-one-day-in-seven theory
is that it has no foundation in scripture. As we noted above with the
40 years in the wilderness, God clearly <i>designated a specific day</i>
as His Sabbath. Israel was <i>never given a choice</i> in what day
they wanted to keep holy as the Sabbath day. The entire community was
to keep God's designated day in unison as a memorial to creation week.
No one had the prerogative or authority to decide to start keeping some
other day as their Sabbath. Note the reaction when some of Israel
decided to look for manna on the seventh day Sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out
some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found
none.<br>
Exo 16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
commandments and my laws?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">By not resting on God's designated Sabbath day, the
law and commandments of God had been broken!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the
sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two
days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place
on the seventh day.<br>
Exo 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that it is emphasized that the Lord God had <em>given</em>
the Sabbath. Neither Moses or Israel had picked the day they wanted to
observe, they were told specifically which day of the week to keep
holy. Keeping it is a sign of loyalty and love for our creator.
Breaking it is the sin of rebellion, because it is breaking the law of
God. No one has the authority to choose the day they will observe as
the seventh day. God did not just institute a seven day cycle, He
blessed and sanctified a <em>specific day</em> as holy. But there <em>is</em>
a choice involved. Either you choose to keep God's seventh day Sabbath,
or you choose to break His commandment by not keeping it, (although
this choice may indeed have been made by many in ignorance.)</p>
  <p>So, just how do we <em>know</em> which day is the Sabbath of the
Lord?</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><b><u>Has The Seventh Day Sabbath

  <p>Ask most any Christian what day of the week Jesus rose from the

sabbath, does <i>not</i> mean that "<i>we</i>", and he, cannot be
absolutely certain about the day. If some effort to study the matter is
at least attempted, the true seventh day can indeed be known. If there
is uncertainty about one day, are not all similarly in doubt, including
Sunday? For nearly 20 centuries the resurrection of Jesus has been
celebrated on Sunday. How do we know that resurrection day was on a
Sunday? Can we be certain of that day?</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><b><u>Was Sunday The Resurrection
Day?</u></b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward
the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to
see the sepulchre.</p>
    <p>Mark 16:2 And very early in the morning the first day of the
week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>
    <p>Luke 24:1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the
morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they
had prepared, and certain others with them.<br>
Luke 24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus lay in the tomb on the sabbath, and the sabbath ended at
sundown, (as does every day according to the Bible). The women came to
the tomb at dawn the following day (the first day of the week) and
discovered that the tomb was already empty. Clearly then, the
resurrection occurred after the close of the Sabbath at sundown, yet
prior to sunrise on <i>the first day of the week</i>. Sunday was
indeed the day of the resurrection.</p>
  <p>Now, Sundaykeepers seem to have no doubts or problems when it
comes to their keeping the first day of the week, the day of the
resurrection. Catholics in particular, will assert that Sunday was kept
by the Apostles in the first century, and maintained by their church
faithfully as a holy day ever since. However, when it comes to the
previous day, the seventh-day sabbath, suddenly there is talk of
calendar changes and doubt that we can really know the correct seventh
day? How does one lose track of the seventh day of the week while
strictly keeping the next, the first day of the week?</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Jesus Knew And Kept The
Sabbath Day.</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Since Jesus was God, he knew <em>exactly</em> which day was the
genuine seventh-day sabbath -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up:
and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
and stood up for to read.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Himself was a keeper of the seventh-day sabbath. Now, if the
Jews had somehow lost track of the sabbath day since the time of Moses,
Jesus would have certainly corrected them, but this was <i>not</i>
necessary, since they were already observing the right day. As this
establishes a firm reference point in history, it remains for the
skeptic to try and prove that the Jews, and the rest of the world,
somehow collectively lost track of the seventh day Sabbath in the 2000
years since the time of Christ, a period which is very well documented.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">The Gregorian Calendar Reform</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Sometimes people will say the calendar reform in the Middle Ages
must have altered the weekdays as we know them, so we cannot be sure
which day is the seventh day. Again people that think this have <em>not</em>
researched the issue.</p>
  <p>The calendar reform of 1582 was initiated by Pope Gregory XIII
because the calendar established by Julius Caesar, was not accurate and
stable. This was due to the fact that the Julian calendar added a leap
day every 4 years, without exception, and this resulted in adding too
many days than required for an accurate solar calendar. The Julian
calendar had commenced the 1st of January of the 46th year before the
birth of Christ (the 708th from the foundation of Rome). At that time
the Spring equinox fell on March 25th, but because of the Julian
calendar's inaccuracy, it had gradually drifted earlier over the years
to March 10th or 11th by 1582. This error was important to the Catholic
church, because under the solar Julian calendar, the date of Easter
(the most important date to the church), was gradually creeping farther
and farther (earlier and earlier) away from the time of year set by the
Council of Nicea in 325 A.D., when the equinox fell about March 21st.
Easter was then to be observed by Roman Catholics on the first Sunday
after the full moon occurring after the Spring equinox, <i>except</i>
when that coincided with the Jewish Passover, in which case Easter was
delayed to the following Sunday.</p>
  <p> <img src="calend.gif" align="right" height="443" hspace="10"
 vspace="20" width="343">To correct this perceived Easter problem, Pope
Gregory XIII (<a
 href="http://www.bluewaterarts.com/calendar/InterGravissimas.htm"><b>Inter
Gravissimas</b></a>) returned the Spring equinox to March 21st by
decreeing that Thursday, October 4th, 1582, would be followed not by
the 5th, but by Friday, October 15th. He jumped the calendar 10 days
numerically, but <i>did not change the weekly cycle of days</i>. </p>
  <p>So that this correction would be maintained, the Pope then decreed
that leap years would occur only when the year was divisible by four,
and only the centennial years that were divisible by 400 would be leap
years. During a leap year, one day is added to the month of February
(the 29th), as a correction. This method of calendar keeping was
gradually adopted across Europe, and the world, and is nearly universal
today.</p>
  <p>England did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752. By that
time, eleven days had been gained so Wednesday, September 2, was
followed by Thursday, September 14. The eleven days were skipped, <i>but
the weekly cycle of days, Sunday through Saturday, remained unchanged
throughout the Middle Ages</i>. (The French Revolution was a notable
exception, when for a period of 14 years (1792-1806) a ten day week was
adopted, the tenth day being the day of rest).</p>
  <p>Inquiries made in 1932 to the <b> <img src="star.gif" height="12"
 width="16"> <a href="navalob.gif">United States Naval Observatory,</a>
  </b>in Washington D.C., and the <b> <img src="star.gif" height="12"
 width="16"><a href="royal-ob.gif"> Royal Greenwich Observatory</a> </b>in
London, England, have also confirmed that the weekly cycle of 7 days as
observed today has not been altered, and remains as it has been since
before the time of Christ.</p>
  <p>So both history and the Bible make it quite clear that Sunday is
the first day of the week and Saturday is indeed the seventh day, which
has been kept by the Jews for millennia, even to the present day. The
true seventh-day sabbath of God has <em>not</em> been lost. Our
Saturday is the <em>same</em> day of the week today as the seventh-day
sabbath of creation.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Who Authorized the Switch to
Sunday Keeping?</font></b></u></p>
  <p>So what rationale exists for worshipping on Sunday, the first day
of the week, instead of Saturday, the biblical seventh day?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"It is the day of Christ's resurrection and Christians have
transferred the solemnity of Sabbath to Sunday to honor that event."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That sounds terrific, but where exactly does the Bible authorize
that change? You see, I really do adhere to the Protestant claim of
"the Bible and the Bible only" as the authoritative Word of God on the
matter. The sabbath was made by God as a memorial to the creation, and
that event was not overshadowed by or done away with by either the
crucifixion or the resurrection.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
and made.</p>
    <p>Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the
sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: herefore the
LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
    <p>Exo 31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the
sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
perpetual covenant.<br>
Exo 31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day
he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The seventh day was sanctified (dedicated to a holy use) for ever
as a day of rest from all work, as a memorial to the completion of
creation.</p>
  <p>If God himself declared the seventh day to be sanctified and holy
for ever, then where in his Word, the Bible, does He rescind the
keeping of the seventh day? Better yet, where in the Bible is the first
day of the week declared to be a holy day to be observed in perpetuity,
as a replacement for the sabbath? So just who made this change to
Sunday?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concerning the Authority of the Church.</i>
&#8212; The Scripture teaches: Remember that you keep the Saturday; six days
shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God, etc. However, the church has transferred
the observance from Saturday to Sunday by virtue of her own power,
without Scripture, without doubt under the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit."<br>
    <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concerning Holidays and Fast-Days.</i> &#8212; The
Sabbath is commanded in various places in the Scriptures. But there is
no mention of the cessation of the Sabbath and the institution of
Sunday in the Gospels, or in Paul's writings, or in all the Bible;
therefore this has taken place by the apostolic church instituting it
without Scripture."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If, however, the church has had power to change the
Sabbath of the Bible into Sunday and to command Sunday- keeping, why
should it not have also this power concerning other days, many of which
are based on the Scriptures &#8212; such as Christmas, circumcision of the
heart, three kings, etc. If you omit the latter, and turn from the
church to the Scriptures alone, then you must keep the Sabbath with the
Jews, which has been kept from the beginning of the world." <sup>12</sup></p>

  <p><b><u>Pope Sylvester I (314-335 A.D.) Decrees the Transfer of
Sabbath Rest to Sunday:</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rabanus Maurus (776-856), abbot of Fulda and later archbishop of
Mainz, Germany, was rated one of the greatest theologians of his age
and probably the most cultured man of his time, and exceptionally
learned in patristics. Besides, he was a zealous defender of the papacy
and its teachings. In one of his works, he says,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pope Sylvester instructed the clergy to keep the <i>feriae</i>.
And, indeed, from an old custom he called the first day [of the week]
the "Lord's [day]," on which the light was made in the beginning and
also the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.<sup>6</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Rabanus Maurus does not mean to say that Sylvester was the first
man who referred to the days of the week as <i>feriae</i> or who first
started the observance of Sunday among Christians. He means that,
according to the testimony of Roman Catholic writers, Sylvester
confirmed those practices and made them official insofar as his church
was concerned. Hence Rabanus says elsewhere in his writings:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pope Sylvester first among the Romans ordered that the names
of the days [of the week], which they previously called after the name
of their gods, that is, [the day] of the Sun, [the day] of the Moon,
[the day] of Mars, [the day] of Mercury, [the day] of Jupiter, [the
day] of Venus, [the day] of Saturn, they should call <i>feriae</i>
thereafter, that is the first <i>feria, </i>the second <i>feria, </i>the
third <i>feria, </i>the fourth <i>feria, </i>the fifth <i>feria, </i>the
sixth <i>feria,</i> because that in the beginning of Genesis it is
written that God said concerning each day: on the first, "Let there be
light:; on the second, "Let there be a firmament"; on the third, "Let
the earth bring forth verdure"; etc. But he [Sylvester] ordered [them]
to call the Sabbath by the ancient term of the law, [to call] the first
      <i>feria</i> the "Lord's day," because on it the Lord rose [from
the dead], Moreover, the same pope decreed that the rest of the Sabbath
should be transferred rather to the Lord's day [Sunday], on order that
on that day we should rest from worldly works for the praise of God.<sup>7</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note particularly, he says that "the same pope [Sylvester I]
decreed that the rest of the Sabbath should be transferred rather to
the Lord's day [Sunday]."<sup>8</sup> According to this statement, he
was the first bishop to introduce the idea that the divinely appointed
rest of the Sabbath day should be transferred to the first day of the
week. This is significant, especially in view of the fact that it was
during Sylvester's pontificate that the emperor of Rome [Constantine]
issued the first civil laws compelling men to rest from secular labor
on Sunday, and that Eusebius, bishop of&nbsp; Caesarea, was the first
theologian on record to present arguments, allegedly from the
Scriptures, that Christ did transfer the rest of the Sabbath day to
Sunday.</p>

12:9-14 and parallels), certainly not to violate the Lord's Day, but to
reveal its full meaning: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
Sabbath" (Mk 2:27). Opposing the excessively legalistic interpretation
of some of his contemporaries, and developing the true meaning of the
biblical Sabbath, Jesus, as "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mk 2:28), restores
to the Sabbath observance its liberating character, carefully
safeguarding the rights of God and the rights of man. This is why
Christians, called as they are to proclaim the liberation won by the
blood of Christ, felt that they had the authority to transfer the
meaning of the Sabbath to the day of the Resurrection.</p>

soon, the Church also came to realize that the first day of the week is
the day of the dawning of creation, the day on which God said: &#8220;Let
there be light&#8221; (<i>Gen</i> 1:3). Therefore Sunday is also the Church&#8217;s
weekly feast of creation &#8211; the feast of thanksgiving and joy over God&#8217;s
creation. At a time when creation seems to be endangered in so many
ways through human activity, we should consciously advert to this
dimension of Sunday too. Then, for the early Church, the first day
increasingly assimilated the traditional meaning of the seventh day,
the Sabbath. We participate in God&#8217;s rest, which embraces all of
humanity. Thus we sense on this day something of the freedom and
equality of all God&#8217;s creatures.</p>

But, you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will
not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The

  <p><u><b>Great is the authority of the Church</b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have noticed, my dear children, that
the day on which we keep the Sabbath is not the same as that on which
it was observed by the Jews. They kept and still keep the Sabbath upon
Saturday, we upon Sunday; they on the seventh day, we on the first day
of the week. Hence the Jews close their shops and attend their
synagogues upon Saturday, but Sunday is observed as the day of rest by
all Christians, even by those sects who are separated from the Catholic
Church. You will ask, what is the reason of this? It is because the
Apostles, who were the first pastors of the Church, by the authority
which [p. 107] they had received from our Blessed Lord to regulate all
that regards his public worship, changed the day appointed for the
keeping of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday &#8212; from the seventh to
the first day of the week. And why did they do so? To honour the
glorious Resurrection of our Lord and the Descent of the Holy Ghost
upon the Apostles, both of which mysteries were accomplished on the
first day of the week. From this we may understand how great is the
authority of the Church in interpreting or explaining to us the
commandments of God &#8212; an authority which is acknowledged by the
universal practice of the whole Christian world, even of those sects
who profess to take the Holy Scriptures as their sole rule of faith,
since they observe as the day of rest not the seventh day of the week
commanded by the Bible, but the first day, which we know is to be kept
holy, only from the tradition and teaching of the Catholic Church. </p>

    <p><i>Article 3. The Third Commandment of the Decalogue.</i></p>
    <p>(203) <i>What does God command in the Third
Commandment--"Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath Day"?</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Third Commandment-"Remember that thou keep
holy the Sabbath Day"--God commands that festival days--that is, days
dedicated to Him--should be kept with divine worship, business and
bodily toil being laid aside. <sup>190</sup></p>
    <p>(204) <i>What were the festival days in the Old Testament?</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Old Testament there were many festival days,
but the chief one was the Sabbath, the very name of which signifies the
rest needful for the worship of God, whence it is called "the day of
rest."</p>
    <p>(205) <i>Why is the Sabbath day not observed under the New
Testament?</i></p>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The Sabbath day is not observed under the
New Testament, because in its place the Church keeps Sunday in honor of
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the coming</p>
    <p>[pg. 121]</p>
    <p>down of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost; the Church also adds other
festival days. <sup>191</sup></p>
    <p>(206) <i>To what, then, are we bound nowadays as regards
keeping festival days holy?</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards keeping festival days holy we are to-day
bound to sanctify, in the manner proscribed by the Church, the Sundays
and other Feast Days appointed by her <sup>192</sup></p>
    <p><sup>190 <i>Exod</i>. xx, 8; xxxi, 13; <i>Deut</i>. v, 12-15.<br>
191 The commandment about keeping the Sabbath holy was not, if we
consider only the day actually stated, a fixed and constant one, but a
variable one, nor was it so much a moral as a ceremonial precept. If,
however, we consider the commandment itself, it will be evident that it
has its moral aspect and forms part of the natural law. Moreover the
date at which the keeping of the Sabbath was removed was precisely that
at which the rest of the Hebrew cult and ceremonial was to cease<font
 face="Times New Roman">&#8213;namely the day of Christ's death. See the <i>Catechism
of the Council of Trent</i>, III, iv, 4ff.</font></sup></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>... in 336 A.D., the Catholic Church, at the Council of
Laodicea, made the ecclesiastical law obliging the faithful
to attend Mass and to abstain from servile works on Sundays. And all
Christians
accepted that law in virtue of the divine authority Christ gave to His
Church when He said, "Whatsoever you bind upon earth shall be bound
also
in Heaven; and whatsoever you loose upon earth shall be loosed also in
Heaven" (Matt., xviii, 18). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does all this mean? It means that the
Seventh Day Adventists are wrong in saying that the Jewish Sabbath
still obliges, for there is clear authority in the Bible for its
abrogation. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventh Day Adventists are right,
however, in accusing other Protestants of inconsistency who speak of
any obligation of Sunday observance whilst rejecting the authority of
the Catholic Church. It is not that there is no authority in the Bible
for Sunday observance. But there is no direct authority for it as an
obligation. The only direct authority for it is that of the Catholic
Church; but that involves the authority of the Bible at least
indirectly in so far as the Bible itself teaches clearly that the
Catholic Church is directly authorized by Christ to legislate in His
name.</p>

    <p>[pg. 53]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>When Protestants do profane work upon Saturday, or
the seventh day of the week, do they follow the Scripture as their only
rule of faith?</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. On the contrary, they have only the authority of
tradition for this practice. In profaning Saturday, they violate one of
God's commandments, which he has never clearly abrogated; "Remember
thou keep holy the Sabbath day."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>Is the observance of Sunday, as the day of rest, a
matter clearly laid down in Scripture?<br>
    </i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It certainly is not; and yet all Protestants
consider the observance of this particular day as essentially necessary
to salvation. To say, we observe the Sunday, because Christ rose from
the dead on that day, is to say, that we should rest on Thursday,
because Christ ascended to heaven on that day, and rested in reality
from the work of redemption.</p>
    <p>[ pg. 54]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>What do you conclude from all this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. That Protestants have no Scripture for the measure
of their day of rest; that they abolish the observance of Saturday
without warrant of Scripture; that they substitute Sunday in its place
without scriptural authority; consequently, that for all this, they
have only traditional authority. Yet Protestants would look upon a man
who would do profane work after five o'clock on Sunday, or keep the
Saturday, and profane the first day, as a victim of perdition. Hence we
must conclude, that the Scripture, which does not teach these things
clearly, does not contain all necessary truths; and, consequently,
cannot be the only rule of faith.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; [ pg. 108]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <em>Have you any other way of proving that the church
has power to institute festivals of precept?</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Had she not such power, she could not have done
that in which all modern religionists agree with her - she could not
have substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week,
for the observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which
there is no Scriptural authority.</p>

    <p>[p. 202]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. What are the days which the Church commands to be
kept holy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. 1st, The Sunday, or the Lord&#8217;s day, which we
observe by apostolical tradition, instead of the Sabbath. &#8230;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. What warrant have you for keeping the Sunday,
preferably to the ancient Sabbath, which was the Saturday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. We have for it the authority of the Catholic
Church, and apostolical tradition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. Does the scripture any where command the Sunday to
be kept for the Sabbath?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The scripture commands us to hear the Church, St.
Matt. xviii. 17. St. Luke x. 16, and to hold fast the traditions of the
Apostles, 2 Thess. ii. 15, but the scripture does not in particular
mention this change of the Sabbath. St. John speaks of the Lord's day,
Rev. i. 10; but he does not tell us what day of the week this was, much
less does he tell us that this day was to take the place of the Sabbath
ordained in the commandments: St. Luke also speaks of the disciples
meeting together to break bread on the first day of the week, Acts xx.
7. And St. Paul, I Cor. xvi 2, orders that on the first day of the week
the Corinthians should lay by in store what they designed to bestow in
charity on the faithful in Judea: but neither the one nor the other
tells us, that this first day of</p>
    <p>[p. 203]<br>
the week was to be henceforward the day of worship, and the Christian
Sabbath; so that truly, the best authority we have for this is the
testimony and ordinance of the Church. And therefore, those who pretend
to be so religious of the Sunday, whilst they take no notice of other
festivals ordained by the same Church authority, show that they act by
humor, and not by reason and religion; since Sundays and holydays all
stand upon the same foundation, viz, the ordinance of the Church. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p. 204]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. What was the reason why the weekly Sabbath was
changed from the Saturday to the Sunday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Because our Lord fully accomplished the work of
our redemption by rising from the dead on a Sunday, and by sending down
the Holy Ghost on a Sunday: as therefore the work of our redemption was
a greater work than that of our creation, the primitive Church thought
the day, in which this work was completely finished, was more worthy
[of] her religious observation than that in which God rested from the
creation, and should be properly called the Lord&#8217;s day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. But has the Church a power to make any
alterations in the commandments of God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The commandments of God, as far as they contain
his eternal law, are unalterable and indispensable; but as to whatever
was only ceremonial, they cease to oblige, since the Mosaic law was
abrogated by Christ's death. Hence, as far as the commandment obliges
us to set aside some part of our time for the worship and service of
our Creator, it is an unalterable and unchangeable precept of the
eternal law, in which the Church cannot dispense: but for as much as it
prescribes the seventh day in particular for this purpose, it is no
more than a ceremonial precept of the old law, which obligeth not
Christians. And therefore, instead of the seventh day, and other
festivals appointed in the old law, the Church has prescribed the
Sundays and holydays to be set apart for God's worship; and these we
are now obliged to keep in consequence of God's commandment, instead of
the ancient Sabbath.</p>

this? The Bible, which Protestants claim to obey exclusively, gives no
authorisation for the substitution of the first day of the week for the
seventh. On what authority, therefore, have they done so? Plainly on
the authority of that very Catholic Church which they abandoned, and
whose traditions they condemn.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 139]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange as it may seem, the State, in passing laws
for the due sanctification of Sunday, is unwittingly acknowledging the
authority of the Catholic Church, and carrying out more or less
faithfully its prescriptions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sunday, as a day of the week set apart for the
obligatory public worship of Almighty God, to be sanctified by a
suspension of all servile labor, trade, and worldly avocations and by
exercises of devotion, is purely a creation of the Catholic Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the Jewish Sabbath; it is, in fact,
entirely distinct from it, and not governed by the enactments of the
Mosaic law. It is part and parcel of the system of the Catholic Church,
as absolutely as Christian marriage is or any other of her sacraments,
her festivals and fasts, her days of joy and mourning, her indulgences
and her jubilees.</p>
    <p>[pg. 149]<br>
The Catholic Church created the Sunday and made the very regulations
which have come down on the statute-books, and she still constantly,
from her pulpits, her catechists' chairs, and the confessional, calls
on her faithful to obey them, to sanctify the day, and refrain from all
that desecrates it.</p>
    <p>[pg. 152]<br>
For ages all Christian nations looked to the Catholic Church, and, as
we have seen, the various states enforced by law her ordinances as to
worship and cessation of labor on Sunday. Protestantism, in discarding
the authority of the Church, has no good reason for its Sunday theory,
and ought logically, to keep Saturday as the Sabbath, with the Jews and
the Seventh-Day Baptists. For their present practice Protestants in
general have no authority but that of a Church which they disown, and
there cannot be a greater inconsistency than theirs in asking the state
to enforce the Sunday laws.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If it be a mere state holiday, most of the legislative
provisions are a mere tyrannical interference with the liberty of a
citizen; and it is a strange holiday on which people are forbidden to
enjoy themselves, under penalty of fine and imprisonment. If it were
merely this, it would be more sensible to punish the man who wore a
long face on a public holiday than the man who laughed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not a mere legal holiday; it is the Lord's day, set
apart by the Catholic Church. It is a religious holiday, and so long as
it is maintained by law it is therefore only a sorry farce to tell us
that in this country there is no union of church and state.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The state, in referring to the Sunday laws, does it as a
religious duty, acknowledging the Divine supremacy, and enforcing laws
made known through the instrumentality of the Church.</p>

  <p><b><u>Not one scintilla of scriptural proof that Sunday is
divinely appointed:</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And now we would ask upon what religious grounds
these earnest advocates for a more strict observance of Sunday
[Protestants] base their claims to make Sunday a day of worship. If all
the new law is contained in the Scripture, there is not one scintilla
of proof that it is the divinely appointed day. Their citadel is not
built upon sand&#8212;its condition is worse, it has no foundation at all. It
is said in Holy Writ that "on the first day of the week the disciples
were gathered for prayer and the breaking of bread." It is also said
that on "another occasion, they were gathered for the same purpose on
the first day of the week to hear St. Paul, who preached until
midnight." St. John, it is said, was in the spirit on "the Lord's day."
But this is a mere recital of facts, it is not the promulgation of a
law. It is not the language, nor does it carry the sanction of a law.
Who then, made Sunday, the first day of the week, the newly appointed
day of worship? The divine organism that traces its history through the
centuries back to Christ, that received the commission, "Go and teach
all nations;" that received from the hands of Christ, the divine
founder of the new covenant, the new law of worship, in whose hands was
placed the gift of infallible truth. To that divine organization, the
Catholic Church, was given the law of worship, and she alone decreed
and she alone had the right to decree that Sunday, the first day of the
week, should be the future day of religious worship. The substance
remained as St. Paul says and the victim of her altars was to be
worshipped. So the substance was preserved; she, therefore, decreed the
law, the day of worship and all the ordinances of that worship. All
outside of her [Protestants] are fighting from a religious point view
for a cause which does not belong to them. The Christian Sunday rests
solely upon the teachings of tradition, which they reject.</p>

commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day. Is this really a law that not
even the pope could change?</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commandment to "keep holy
the Sabbath day" could never be interpreted as a commandment referring
to Sunday Mass. For one thing, the Mass was still many centuries in the
future when Moses received the Ten Commandments. For another, the
Sabbath day - from the Hebrew verb "sabat," rest - was Saturday, the
seventh day of the week, not Sunday.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Christians have, of course, celebrated Sunday as the
Lord's Day from the earliest centuries, but the obligation to attend
Mass on Sunday, as we know it, is comparatively recent. That
obligation, as it now exists in church law, could be removed or
modified by the church itself.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why was the Sabbath

    </b>[pg. 119]</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; The very early
Christians changed the "Sabbath" day to Sunday for a variety of
reasons. First, the fact that the resurrection of Jesus is recorded in
Scripture as occurring on the first day of the week certainly had much
to do with the fact that this seemed the most appropriate day to
celebrate the Eucharist to commemorate that event. The first Christians
also made a point of changing their days of observance (including fast
days) from those proscribed by Jewish law to emphasize their departure
from traditions and customs of the people of Israel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Seventh Day Adventist Church was formed about the
middle of the last century, the four men and one woman who became its
nucleus were somehow convinced that Saturday, not Sunday, should still
be the "holy day" of the week. It is one of the lesser ways the
teachings of that church depart from general Christian tradition.
There's no reason whatsoever to suspect this Sunday tradition will ever
change.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Which day is the Sabbath?</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; We commonly refer to
the Sabbath as the seventh day of the week. The Bible does not say
this. It does say many times that the Sabbath is the seventh day after
six days of work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a big difference in these two sevens. The seventh
day of the calendar week is one set date each week, but the seventh day
after the beginning of the first day of work can be any day of the week.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible does not speak of any consecutive seven-day
cycles up to the time of the Israelites' first Sabbath. Therefore, we
know that before this time, there was no standard weekly calendar used
such as the one in use at Christ's time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though God commanded a Sabbath rest day, he did not
necessarily mean the seventh day. Thus, Sunday-keeping saints have not
gone to hell for not keeping Saturday.</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>You may be
right. I'm not sure how practical your suggestion is, however. No
matter how theoretically correct you are, I don't believe the argument
will carry much weight with people who believe we must observe the
Sabbath on Saturday.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe you would find it difficult to discover evidence
that [pg. 120] observance of a seven-day week came after the Jewish
regulation of rest on the seventh day. Long before the observance of
the Sabbath rest was an established regulation among the Hebrews, a
seven-day week was not all uncommon in several Near Eastern cultures,
including that of the Jews. Apparently this resulted from the division
of the lunar month (28 days) into four sections, though other cultures,
such as the Greeks and Romans, divided the lunar month into three
sections of roughly 10 days each.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is entirely possible that the Hebrew Tradition of six
days work and one day rest developed out of the context of the
seven-day week, the last day of which would be a day or recuperation
from labor. In other words, the history of the Sabbath may be a
fascinating study, but it doesn't offer much ammunition against
Sabbatarians (those who insist on Saturday as the holy day). Our
reasons for observing Sunday as the Christian holy day arise from
entirely different sources.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Christ gave the church the power to make
laws binding upon the conscience. Show me one sect that claims or
possesses the power to do so save the Catholic church. There is none,
and yet all christendom acknowledges the power of the church to do so,
as I will prove to you. For example, the observance of Sunday. How can
other denominations keep this day? The Bible commands you to keep the
Sabbath day. Sunday is not the Sabbath day; no man dare assert that it
is, for the Bible says as plainly as words can make it that the seventh
day is the Sabbath, i.e., Saturday, for we all know Sunday to be the
first day of the week. Besides, the Jews have been keeping the Sabbath
unto the present day. I am not a rich man, but I will give $1,000 to
any man who will prove by the Bible alone that Sunday is the day we are
bound to keep. No, it cannot be done, it is impossible. The observance
of Sunday is solely a law of the Catholic church, and therefore is not
binding upon others. The church changed the Sabbath to Sunday and all
the world bows down and worships upon that day in silent obedience to
the mandates of the Catholic church. Is this not a living miracle? That
those who hate us so bitterly obey and acknowledge our power every week
and <font size="2">DO NOT KNOW IT! ...</font></p>

    <p>The attendance at the Catholic Church on Sunday evening was
unusually large, many being unable to gain admittance. The subject
treated on that evening was "The Power and Authority of the Catholic
Church". Father Enright claimed that the authority and existence of his
church antedated that of the Bible. His remarks upon Sunday observance
created something of a sensation. He said:</p>
    <p>&#8220;My brethren, look about you upon the various wrangling sects
and denominations.&nbsp;Show me one that claims or possesses the power
to make laws binding on the conscience. There is but one on the face of
the earth&#8212;the Catholic Church&#8212;that has the power upon the conscience,
binding before God, binding under pain of hell fire.&nbsp;Take, for
instance, the day we celebrate&#8212;Sunday. What right have the Protestant
churches to observe that day? None whatever. You say it is to obey the
commandment, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." But Sunday is
not the Sabbath according to the Bible and the record of time. Everyone
knows that Sunday is the first day of the week, while Saturday is the
seventh day, and the Sabbath, the day consecrated as a day of rest. It
is so recognized in all civilized nations. I have repeatedly offered
$1,000 to anyone who will furnish any proof from the Bible that Sunday
is the day we are bound to keep, and no one has called for the money.
If any person in this city will show me any scripture for it, I will
tomorrow evening publicly acknowledge it and thank him for it. It was
the Holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from Saturday to
Sunday, the first day of the week. And it not only compelled all to
keep Sunday, but at the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364 anathematized
those who kept the Sabbath and urged all persons to labor on the
seventh day under the penalty of anathema.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Which church does the whole civilized world obey? Protestants
call us every horrible name they can think of &#8212; AntiChrist, the scarlet
colored beast, Babylon, etc., and at the same time profess great
reverence for the Bible, and yet by their solemn act of keeping Sunday,
they acknowledge the power of the Catholic Church.&nbsp;The Bible says:
"Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." But the Catholic Church
says, "No, keep the first day of the week&#8217; and the whole world bows in
obedience.&#8221;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Some non-Catholics object to Purgatory because there is no
specific mention of it in Scripture. There is no specific mention of
the word Sunday in Scripture. The Sabbath is mentioned, but Sabbath
means Saturday. Yet Christians of almost all denominations worship on
Sunday, not Saturday. The Jews observe Saturday. Nowhere in the Bible
is it stated that worship should be changed from Saturday to Sunday.
The fact is that the Church was in existence for several centuries
before the Bible was given to the world. The Church made the Bible, the
Bible did not make the Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the Church which gave us the Bible, instituted,
by God's authority, Sunday as the day of worship. This same Church, by
the same divine authority, taught the doctrine of Purgatory long before
the Bible was made. We have, therefore, the same authority for
Purgatory as we have for Sunday.</p>

		reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations. They are 
		fundamentally immutable, and they oblige always and everywhere. No one

		<b>2076</b> By his life and by his preaching Jesus attested to the 
		permanent validity of the Decalogue. </span><br><span class="text">
		</span><br><span class="text"><b>2079</b> The Decalogue forms an organic 
		unity in which each &quot;word&quot; or &quot;commandment&quot; refers to all the others 
		taken together. To transgress one commandment is to infringe the whole 
		Law (cf. <i>Jas </i>2:10-11). </span>
	</blockquote>
  <p>But this current magesterial catechism of the highest authority freely 
  admits that Sunday is not the biblical Sabbath, and then proceeds to 
  contradict itself on the <span class="text">fundamentally immutable, 
  permanently valid </span>Ten Commandments, by asserting that Sunday has 
  replaced the biblical Sabbath for the Christian:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">
	<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P7O.HTM"><strong>2175</strong></a> 
	Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it follows 
	chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial observance 
	replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday fulfills the 
	spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's eternal rest in 
	God. For worship under the Law prepared for the mystery of Christ, and what 
	was done there prefigured some aspects of Christ.</p>
	<p>So dear reader, you should no longer have any doubt that Sunday is
the first day of week, and that nowhere in the Bible is Sunday blessed,
sanctified or commanded by God as a day of weekly worship. If you claim
to be Protestant, and acknowledge that the Bible is your only ruler of
truth, then on what basis do you worship on Sunday? You have only the
Tradition of the Catholic Church, and it's claim of authority to change
the laws of God to rest your case on. In spite of your claim of
Protestantism, you are casting aside the only day the Bible sanctifies
in perpetuity by the Word of God and you are replacing it with a day
authorized ONLY by the word of Roman Catholic Tradition. If you hallow
Sunday, then you are essentially Catholic on that matter, not a "Bible
Only" Protestant.</p>
  <p>So which authority do you acknowledge, the Word of God that
commands seventh day Sabbath worship or the Tradition of the Catholic
Church which commands Sunday, first day worship?</p>
  <p>There is no other choice.</p>
