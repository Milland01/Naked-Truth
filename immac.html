A Roman Catholic Holy Day of Obligation -<br>
December 8th.</font></strong></p>
</center><hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>On the Roman Catholic Church calendar of holy days, December 8th is 
  celebrated as a holy day of obligation, commemorating the Immaculate 
  Conception of Mary. The observance of this feast began with a Papal encyclical 
  by Pope Pius IX, when he formally defined the dogma of the Immaculate 
  Conception, INEFFABILIS DEUS, on December 8, 1854.</p>

  <strong>INEFFABILIS DEUS</strong></a> online. </p>
  <p>To the Roman Catholic, December 8th is a significant date, not to be 
  treated lightly. As a holy day of obligation, the Catholic is <em>required</em> 
  by the first Precept of the Church to attend Mass. The days of obligation are 
  set forth in the Vatican's Catechism in paragraph 2177. </p>
  <p>According to the December 3rd, 1996 press release from the Vatican 
  Information Service, the papal schedule for December 8th, 1996 included the 
  following events:<br>

        at Rome's Spanish Square</font></u></strong> </p>
        <p>On the afternoon of December 8, Pope John Paul II visited and paid 
        homage to the statue of Mary located in the Spanish Square in Rome, 
        which is pictured at left.</p>
        <p>Following the papal encyclical of Pius IX in 1854, the Column of the 
        Immaculate Conception was erected near the Collegio Di Propaganda Fide 
        (the Jesuit College for the propagation of the faith), at the southern 
        end of the Piazza Di Spagna (Spanish Square). Designed by Luigi Poletti, 
        it is an ancient Roman column topped by a statue of Mary, in honor of 
        her Immaculate Conception. </p>
        <p>Ever since its dedication in 1857, it is a papal tradition to visit 
        this monument on December 8th and crown the statue of Mary with a 
        garland of flowers, following which the faithful would then place 
        flowers at the base of the column in homage to the immaculate, sinless 
        Mary.</td>

  <p>According to the Vatican Information Service press release, the next item 
  on the papal itinerary was a visit to St. Mary Major Basilica (Santa Maria 
  Maggiore) to venerate the image of Mary known as the &quot;Salus Populi Romani,&quot; 
  which is an icon depicting Mary and the Christ child, over the altar of the 
  Pauline Chapel (Cappella Paolina). </p>

        <td>&nbsp;This basilica, the Santa Maria Maggiore, originated from a dream 
        Pope Liberius had in 356 A.D. when he was told in the dream by the 
        Virgin Mary to build a church where he found snow. Miraculously, it is 
        said that Liberius next saw snow in the summer, on August 5th, on 
        Esquiline hill. The resulting church has also been known as the Liberian 
        Basilica. One of the central images in the apse is a mosaic portraying 
        the Coronation of the Virgin Mary as the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot; by Jacopo 
        Torriti.
        <p>In 1615, Pope Paul V had a marble column removed from the basilica of 
        Roman emperors Maxentius and Constantine, and re-erected it in the
        <a href="http://www.kfki.hu/~arthp/html/p/pannini/maggiore.html">Piazza 
        Santa Maria Maggiore</a> immediately south of the basilica, and topped 
        it with a statue of the Virgin Mary and Child. To the north of the 
        basilica, in the Piazza dell' Esquilino, is an Egyptian obelisk erected 
        by Pope Sixtus V in 1587, which is topped with a cross.</td>

  <p align="center"><strong><a name="torch"><font size="5"><u>Ndocciata 
  Torchlight Procession.</u></font></a></strong> </p>
  <p>Following his veneration of the images of Mary, the November 27th, 1996 
  Vatican Information Service press release stated that the Pope would be 
  honored with a torchlight procession, that would proceed down the Via della 
  Conciliazione, to St. Peter's Square. </p>
  <p>The procession was led by folk groups from the area of Molise Italy, who 
  carried 2,000 four-meter high lit torches of fir and broomwood, called &quot;ndocce&quot;. 
  The purpose of the event was to honor the 50th anniversary of the Pope's 
  priesthood. The torchlight procession, described as an &quot;extraordinary river of 
  fire&quot;, ended under the study window of John Paul II, who then addressed the 
  crowd. </p>
  <p>
  <img src="torch.gif" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="263" height="151"> 
  The VIS press release freely admitted that this &quot;ndocciata&quot; procession has its 
  roots in pre-Christian (pagan) light (sun) worship. In the Molise region of 
  Italy, this procession normally occurs on the 24th of December, in the town of 
  Agnone to &quot;honor&quot; the birth of Jesus Christ. It was said by the VIS to be the 
  largest Christmas event of its kind in Europe linked to light worship. </p>
  <p>In the VIS press release of Sunday, December 8th 1996, the Pope is quoted 
  as making the following remarks to the assembled multitude in St. Peter's 
  square following the procession-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;you, shepherds and farmers, the protagonists of such a stupendous 
    display of faith and culture, which anticipates the joyous announcement of 
    the birth of the Lord. Your fathers, converting to the Christian faith, have 
    transformed <strong>the ancient pagan rite of the solstitial fire</strong>, 
    into a festive welcoming of Jesus, Light of the world.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Pope has admitted the Ndocciata Torchlight Procession is utterly pagan 
  in origin, originally honoring the Winter Solstice. This is a day of great 
  significance to the sun worshipper, because it signals the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the 
  sun. (The day of the Winter Solstice has the shortest amount of daylight in 
  the year.) The Ndocciata actually celebrates the birth of the pagan sun god, 
  and now the Roman Church maintains it has been Christianized to celebrate the 
  birth of the Son of God. </p>
  <p>Is this what the Bible teaches us? Are we to adopt pagan celebrations and 
  practices and &quot;baptize&quot; them? Plain and simple, this is apostasy and 
  corruption of the highest order. It is a mixing of sun worshipping paganism 
  into the Church, doctrinal fornication, that provokes the Lord to great anger-
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 2:11 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, 
    and served Baalim:<br>
    Judg 2:12 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them 
    out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people 
    that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the 
    LORD to anger.<br>
    Judg 2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.<br>
    Judg 2:14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered 
    them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the 
    hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand 
    before their enemies.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And what of Christmas itself? What is the origin of celebrating the birth 
  of Jesus Christ on December 25th? Does the Bible specify the date? Is it a 
  Biblical festival day? Please read <nobr>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b><a href="xmas.html#">Celebrating 
  the Birth of the Sun.</a></nobr></b></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>The Immaculate Conception</u></font></b>
  </p>
  <p>So, what of this festival of the Immaculate Conception of Mary? This dogma 
  of the Roman Catholic Church states that Mary was conceived without sin, and 
  that she never sinned throughout her entire life. What does the Bible say of 
  this?-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 3:10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br>
    Rom 3:11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after 
    God.<br>
    Rom 3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become 
    unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
    <p>Rom 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
    Rom 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is 
    in Christ Jesus:</p>
    <p>Rom 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death 
    by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: </p>
    <p>Luke 1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<br>
    Luke 1:47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It follows that one who has not sinned has no need of a Saviour, but the 
  Bible tells us that we have all sinned, there are none righteous, to include 
  Mary, and she herself the Bible tells us, rejoiced in her Saviour. The dogma 
  of Mary's Immaculate Conception and sinless life is not only unbiblical, but
  <em>contradicts</em> the clear teaching of the Bible.</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><b><u>Bowing Before Images</u></b></font></p>
  <p>What of bowing down before graven images in veneration or homage of whoever 
  the image represents? What does the Bible say of this?- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>
    Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
    any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that 
    is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
    LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
    children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The act of bowing down before graven images is expressly forbidden by 
  scripture, yet in the Roman Catholic Church, it is common practice today.</p>
  <hr width="50%" align="center" size="1">
  <p>Bowing before images and pre-Christian pagan torchlight processions, on a 
  day that is to honor the unbiblical dogma of Mary's sinlessness - note this 
  warning in which mixing truth and doctrinal error is called the wine of 
  fornication- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, <strong>Babylon is 
    fallen, is fallen,</strong> that great city, because she made all nations 
    drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
    <p>Rev 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, <strong>
    Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen,</strong> and is become the 
    habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every 
    unclean and hateful bird.<br>
    Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
    fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, 
    and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
    delicacies.<br>
    Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, <strong>Come out of 
    her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive 
    not of her plagues.</strong><br>
    Rev 18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her 
    iniquities. </p>
