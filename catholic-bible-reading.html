  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">The <i>Catholic</i> Attitude Towards 
  Reading Scripture</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>&nbsp;[pg. 4] ...&nbsp; The conduct of the Catholics with regard to holy 
  Scripture is undeniably and professedly different from that of Protestants. 
  Protestants, all such at least as in any degree pretend to piety, have, as a 
  matter of course, a Bible on their book-shelves, and make more or less a point 
  of reading it; and all, whether pious or not, and whether they read the Bible 
  or not, fully admit it to be their duty to read it; whereas thousands of 
  Catholics live very piously and die very happily, without ever having had a 
  Bible in their possession; and so far from its being considered every one's 
  duty to read it, in some persons, and under certain circumstances, such a 
  study has been discouraged, and even prohibited.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This difference of conduct is quite enough to account for the 
  popular outcry, inasmuch as it is plain to all that it is not accidental, but 
  resting on a real difference of principle; and that Protestants should have 
  construed that difference in the way most to flatter themselves, and to 
  condemn us, whom they have been sworn in, as it were, to hate from their very 
  cradles, is perhaps no more than was to be expected. At</p>
  <p>[pg. 5] any rate, such is the case. Protestants read the Bible; Catholics 
  do not: and why? &quot;We need not go far for a reason,&quot; say the Protestants; &quot;the 
  Protestant religion is in the Bible, the Catholic is not; therefore 
  Protestants are urged to read the Bible to confirm them in the truth of 
  Protestantism, while Catholics are forbidden to read it; lest they should 
  discover the falsehood of Catholicism.&quot; This theory certainly accounts for the 
  facts in question, and in the way most satisfactory to those who have framed 
  it; it overlooks, it is true, the strange improbability that the Church should 
  watch over a certain volume from age to age with jealous care, loudly 
  proclaiming to the world that that volume is the inspired word of God, and yet 
  all the while consciously persist in teaching a doctrine contradicted by that 
  inspired word: but greater difficulties that these are swallowed every day by 
  determined prejudice; and it is usually of as little avail to point them out, 
  as it was for the lamb in the fable to ask how she could possibly have muddied 
  the stream for the wolf, who was at that very time drinking nearer the 
  fountain-head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, however, there my be who really wish to be candid and to see 
  the truth; and to such</p>
  <p>[pg. 6] it may be worth while to explain, one for all, that if Catholics do 
  not read the Bible in the same way as Protestants do, it is not, as 
  Protestants assert, because the teaching of their Church is such as to dread 
  being confronted face to face with Scripture, nor because they less fully 
  believe than any Protestant can do in the inspiration of Scripture; but simply 
  because they do not believe in their own individual inspiration as 
  interpreters of Scripture. Scripture they well know can make no mistake; but 
  they are in no way sure that they themselves can make no mistake as to what 
  Scripture means. They believe that there is one authorized interpreter of 
  Scripture, and one alone,<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;the Holy Catholic 
  Church, which is divinely guarded from all possibility of error, being 
  informed by the same Holy Spirit by whom Scripture was inspired, and therefore 
  alone able to penetrate it real meaning. Her interpretation of it he trusts 
  with unhesitating certainty; while to trust any crude theories be might 
  himself be tempted to form respecting it, would seem to him simply ridiculous. 
  Thus <b>he [the Catholic] never dreams of reading Holy Scripture with the view 
  of gathering from it the articles of his belief; indeed, to do so would be to 
  cease at</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 7]<b> once from being a Catholic in 
  heart; and any one reading Scripture in this spirit, or in danger of doing so, 
  would certainly be forbidden to read it at all, if he desired to continue in 
  the communion of the faithful; for he would be virtually denying that the 
  Church is the sole infallible interpreter of Scripture, whereas the 
  acknowledgment of her as such is the very fundamental principle of 
  Catholicism. Catholics, then, do not study the Scripture to learn their faith, 
  but to grow in holiness;</b> and for this purpose selections from Scripture, 
  or meditations, and devotional works on Scriptural subjects (in which 
  Catholicism is rich beyond what Protestants can imagine), are found to be more 
  useful, and also to give more insight into the real spirit and meaning of 
  Scripture itself, than the unaided study of the entire Bible. It is surely, 
  then, nothing very wonderful that the Bible, as a whole, should be found less 
  frequently in the hands of Catholics than in those of Protestants, whose 
  principle in this matter is altogether opposite. While Catholics acknowledge 
  but one authoritative interpreter, Protestants hold that every man in his own 
  interpreter; that from &quot;the Bible and the Bible only&quot; every man is bound to 
  learn all that he must believe in order</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 8] to be saved; that if he </font>prays 
  for the help of God's Holy Spirit, this alone, without human aid, will guard 
  him from all material error; that no church, no body of men, no teacher 
  whatever has any Divine authority to interpret Scripture for him; he must do 
  it for himself, and he can. If, then, Protestants must gather for themselves 
  from the bare text of the Bible, the knowledge of those truths which they must 
  believe if they wish to be saved, what can they do, what <i>must</i> they do, 
  but pore and ponder over that text from day to day, and from year to year, so 
  long as&nbsp; life endures? To do this is but to be consistent; but they 
  should not find fault with Catholics for being consistent also; both parties 
  act in this particular as they <i>must</i> act on their respective principles. 
  The only question is, Which principle is the true one? or, in other words, 
  What seems to have been in this matter the will of Almighty God, by whom the 
  Scriptures were given, and to whom alone it belongs to determine their use? 
  Was it His design that each individual should gather his faith out of 
  Scripture, has He provided also an infallible interpreter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before considering this question, however,</p>
  <p>[pg. 9] we must remark, that nothing can be more unjust than the way in 
  which it is usually stated by Protestants, as though the parties are opposed 
  to each other were the Bible and the Church. &quot;I hold by my Bible,&quot; they say, 
  &quot;and you hold by your Church;&quot; thus representing the Church and the Bible as 
  two hostile fortresses, as it were, flanking the battle-field on either side, 
  to which the contending parties respectively betake themselves. It is no such 
  thing: the real question lies between the Church and the individual, <i>the 
  Bible being the subject-matter common to both;</i> and the point at issue, <i>
  Who is to interpret the Bible?</i> which the Catholic believes to be the 
  Church, and the Protestant himself; so that &quot;the Church&quot; and &quot;himself&quot; are the 
  parties opposed, not the Church and the Bible. That the Bible is the inspired 
  word of God, Protestants and Catholics are perfectly agreed in believing. <b>
  It is true, Catholics do not hold, as Protestants profess to do, that nothing 
  can possibly be matter of divine revelation which is not contained in holy 
  Scripture, nor do Protestants themselves in fact, though they do in words; for 
  they believe the inspiration of holy Scripture to be matter of Divine 
  revelation, yet this, from the very nature of the</b></p>
  <p>[pg 10] <b>case, cannot rest on the testimony of Scripture itself. So, too, 
  with the duty of baptizing infants, and of observing Sunday instead of 
  Saturday as the Christian holiday, on which points Protestants believe and act 
  as Catholics do, while yet they would be puzzled to find Scripture warrant for 
  so doing. ...</b></p>
