  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mark 9:33 And he came to Capernaum: and 
    being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among 
    yourselves by the way?<br>
    Mark 9:34 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among 
    themselves, who should be the greatest.<br>
    Mark 9:35 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If 
    any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of 
    all.<br>
    Mark 9:36 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he 
    had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,<br>
    Mark 9:37 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth 
    me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.<br>
    Mark 9:38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out 
    devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he 
    followeth not us.<br>
    Mark 9:39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do 
    a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.<br>
    Mark 9:40 For he that is not against us is on our part.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Luke 9:46 Then there arose a reasoning among 
    them, which of them should be greatest.<br>
    Luke 9:47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, 
    and set him by him,<br>
    Luke 9:48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name 
    receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for 
    he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.<br>
    Luke 9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils 
    in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.<br>
    Luke 9:50 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not 
    against us is for us.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the above two passages, while on the way to 
  Capernaum, the disciples in a moment of egotism and pride were discussing 
  which among themselves would be the greatest in the kingdom of God. Jesus, 
  being aware of their discussion, said that the humble lowly servant of God 
  will be great in the kingdom, not the haughty or prideful. Then John, not 
  perceiving his arrogance, mentions that he (and his brother James) saw a total 
  stranger casting out demons in Jesus' name. Because this man was not known to 
  the apostles and not authorized by them to either preach or cast out devils, 
  they forbid him to continue. The implication is also that this stranger 
  refused to submit to them and continued to cast out devils despite the 
  prohibition. The issue to James and John was one of apostolic authority and 
  complete subjection to that presumed authority by all members of &quot;the church.&quot; 
  Jesus however, corrects John, and tells him not to forbid anyone from doing 
  the work of the Lord, and this applies whether they know who it is or not. In 
  context, it is clear that John is being rebuked for his arrogance, that he 
  does <em>not</em> have the authority over others that he presumed he had. One 
  did not need to be under apostolic control or authority to be laboring for the 
  glory of God and spreading the Gospel message.</font></p>

  precisely same problem as James and John:</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman">8. ... It was thus the duty of all who heard 
    Jesus Christ, if they wished for eternal salvation, not merely to accept His 
    doctrine as a whole, but to assent with their entire mind to all and every 
    point of it, since it is unlawful to withhold faith from God even in regard 
    to one single point. ...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">9. The Church, founded on these principles 
    and mindful of her office, has done nothing with greater zeal and endeavour 
    than she has displayed in guarding the integrity of the faith. Hence she 
    regarded as rebels and expelled from the ranks of her children all who held 
    beliefs on any point of doctrine different from her own. The Arians, the 
    Montanists, the Novatians, the Quartodecimans, the Eutychians, did not 
    certainly reject all Catholic doctrine: they abandoned only a certain 
    portion of it. Still who does not know that they were declared heretics and 
    banished from the bosom of the Church? In like manner were condemned all 
    authors of heretical tenets who followed them in subsequent ages. &quot;There can 
    be nothing more dangerous than those heretics who admit nearly the whole 
    cycle of doctrine, and yet by one word, as with a drop of poison, infect the 
    real and simple faith taught by our Lord and handed down by Apostolic 
    tradition&quot; (Auctor Tract. de Fide Orthodoxa contra Arianos).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The practice of the Church has always been 
    the same, as is shown by the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, who were 
    wont to hold as outside Catholic communion, and alien to the Church, whoever 
    would recede in the least degree from any point of doctrine proposed by her 
    authoritative Magisterium. Epiphanius, Augustine, Theodore:, drew up a long 
    list of the heresies of their times. St. Augustine notes that other heresies 
    may spring up, to a single one of which, should any one give his assent, he 
    is by the very fact cut off from Catholic unity. &quot;No one who merely 
    disbelieves in all (these heresies) can for that reason regard himself as a 
    Catholic or call himself one. For there may be or may arise some other 
    heresies, which are not set out in this work of ours, and, if any one holds 
    to one single one of these he is not a Catholic&quot; (S. Augustinus, De

      for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he 
      is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly 
      asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the 
      same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as 
      through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the 
      Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would 
      refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">John and his brother James tried to assert 
  their apostolic authority in precisely the same manner, and Jesus made it 
  clear they were in error and being overly presumptuous. James and John had a 
  hard time learning this lesson. Note the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Luke 9:51 And it came to pass, when the time 
    was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to 
    Jerusalem,<br>
    Luke 9:52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered 
    into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.<br>
    Luke 9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he 
    would go to Jerusalem.<br>
    Luke 9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, 
    wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, 
    even as Elias did?<br>
    Luke 9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner 
    of spirit ye are of.<br>
    Luke 9:56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save 
    them. And they went to another village.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Merely because a Samaritan village was not 
  hospitable to them as Jews, James and John wanted to destroy everyone in it! 
  Note that Jesus responds that they were not acting in the spirit of God, which 
  seeks to save men, not destroy them. Yet, this same destructive attitude has 
  been displayed by the Catholic Church down through time. Those who have dared 
  to oppose or refused to submit to the presumed authority of the Catholic 
  Church have been hunted down in inquisitions, imprisoned and even burned at 
  the stake as heretics. The fundamental issue to them, as demonstrated above, 
  is not whether you accept Jesus Christ as your saviour, but rather, do you 
  submit to the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The above passages in Mark and Luke make plain 
  the attitude that prevails when men take unto themselves supreme authority and 
  then attempt to lord it over others. It also makes clear that this is <em>not</em> 
  in the spirit of God. The true church of God will not be known by boasts of 
  infallible authority, inquisitions, persecution, or extermination of alleged 
  heretics, but rather by their willingness to serve their fellow man by 
  spreading the Gospel message of salvation through Jesus Christ.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mat 20:25 But Jesus called them (the 
    disciples) unto him, and said, Ye know that <strong>the princes of the 
    Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise 
    authority upon them.</strong><br>
    Mat 20:26 <strong>But it shall not be so among you:</strong> but whosoever 
    will be great among you, let him be your minister;<br>
    Mat 20:27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:<br>
    Mat 20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to 
    minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mark 10:42 But Jesus called them to him, and 
    saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the 
    Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise 
    authority upon them.<br>
    Mark 10:43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great 
    among you, shall be your minister:<br>
    Mark 10:44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of 
    all.<br>
    Mark 10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to 
    minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Luke 22:25 And he said unto them, The kings 
    of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise 
    authority upon them are called benefactors.<br>
    Luke 22:26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let 
    him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.<br>
    Luke 22:27 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that 
    serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that 
    serveth.</font></p>
