<center><strong><font size="5">Matthew 18:18 and Infallible Church Authority.</font></strong></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
    be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed
    in heaven.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By quoting these words of Jesus, many a Roman Catholic attempts to assert
  the absolute authority of the Church to declare Catholic Tradition and dogma
  infallibly and bind and loose in God's name. And if you look no farther than
  this verse, it really does seem to say that absolutely whatever the Church
  declares in His name will be upheld by God Himself, as though God had
  commanded it. Heady stuff this presumed absolute authority, as the history of
  Roman Catholicism reveals. The axiom that power corrupts and absolute power
  corrupts absolutely comes to mind. But does this verse really give the church
  absolute authority to declare whatever they want, without limit, and allow
  them to do it in God's name? Let's look at the verse in <em>context</em> in
  order to discover the real meaning:</p>
</blockquote>
<strong><u>
<p align="center"><font size="4">The Lost Sheep</font></u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.<br>
    Mat 18:12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
    gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the
    mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?<br>
    Mat 18:13 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth
    more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.<br>
    Mat 18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that
    one of these little ones should perish.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<strong><u>
<p align="center"><font size="4">The Lost Brother</font></u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
    tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou
    hast gained thy brother.<br>
    Mat 18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more,
    that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.<br>
    Mat 18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but
    if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and
    a publican.<br>
    Mat 18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be
    bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
    heaven.<br>
    Mat 18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as
    touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my
    Father which is in heaven.<br>
    Mat 18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am
    I in the midst of them.<br>
    Mat 18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother
    sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?<br>
    Mat 18:22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but,
    Until seventy times seven.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In this passage Jesus is laying down guidelines for the church on how to
  deal with a wayward church member. Restated, the procedure Jesus establishes
  is this:
  <ul>
    <li>If a brother in Christ has sinned against you, first take the matter to
      him in private. If he listens to you and repents, the matter has been
      settled and nothing more need be done.</li>
    <li>If he will not listen to your private admonition, then take two or three
      witnesses and council him again to repent of his sin.</li>
    <li>If he refuses to repent,<em> then</em> take the matter before the church
      body for resolution.</li>
    <li>If he still refuses to repent of his sin before the church, then he is
      to be treated as an unbeliever, no longer part of the church. The church
      in diligently following scripture has fulfilled it's duty in trying to
      rehabilitate the lost brother.</li>
    <li>Through this process, and at any level along the way, a man who truly
      repents on each occasion could be forgiven 70 times 7 times (symbolic for
      without limit).</li>
    <li>If this procedure is followed, according to the word of God as set down
      in <strong><em>scripture</em></strong>, then God himself will affirm the
      decision made by the church <strong><em>with respect to this lost brother,
      that is to re-accept him or disfellowship him, </em></strong>because Jesus
      Himself is indeed present when two or three are gathered <strong><em>in
      His name.</em></strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<strong><u>
<p align="center"><font size="4">In His Name</font></u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So, what does it mean to be gathered in His name? It means to be gathered
  in acknowledgment of His authority as our Lord and God.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
    beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We are indeed ambassadors for Christ, and an ambassador is a representative
  who speaks on behalf of the one he represents. But is an ambassador able to
  say anything he pleases, without any restrictions? No, an ambassador speaks
  only within the limits of the instructions of his master. Suppose in the
  example of the lost brother above, after speaking with him privately in the
  first step above, you by-pass the second step and go directly to the church at
  large and make the matter public. Have you followed the guidelines established
  by God? No, you have not. You have not given your brother an opportunity to
  settle the matter between you at the lowest possible level of privacy. In
  doing so, you have really wronged your brother by acting too hastily to
  publicize his error, and God may not affirm your actions as a result. It is
  only by faithfully following the process laid down in scripture that you will
  have the complete approval of God in your actions to rehabilitate a wayward
  brother. Note that Jesus Himself is an ambassador, an ambassador for God the
  Father-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 6:38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
    will of him that sent me.<br>
    John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all
    which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again
    at the last day.</p>
    <p>John 5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
    unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father
    do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Himself can do <em>nothing</em> if it does not reflect the will of
  His Father. So, as an example, does the church body have the right to
  disfellowship a member if they do <em>not</em> follow the guidelines set down
  by Jesus Christ Himself in scripture? In doing so, would they be acting in His
  name and doing His will? No they would not. They would no longer be acting as
  ambassadors, they would be usurping the authority of God and casting aside His
  specific instructions on how to deal with the situation. Just as Jesus Christ
  is limited by the will of His Father, we are similarly limited by the word of
  God. <strong><em>The limiting factor in this situation is the procedure set
  down by God Himself in His word, the scriptures.</em> </strong>Follow the
  scripture in matters like this and you indeed speak as an ambassador for
  Christ, with His full authority, and He will completely approve the decision
  the church makes in His name.</p>
  <p>In context this entire passage in Matthew is dealing with a specific
  situation, that of trying to recover and rehabilitate a lost brother, and the
  actions that must be taken if he refuses to listen to sound admonition from
  the church members.</p>
  <p>So now I ask you, when seen in context, does Matthew 18:18 give the Roman
  Catholic Church (or any church for that matter) absolute authority to proclaim
  anything they wish, without any limit what-so-ever, and declare it as
  infallibly binding it on all Christendom, and do so the name of God?</p>
