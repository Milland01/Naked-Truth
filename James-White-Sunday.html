<hr>

<p>The following email was sent to Dr. James White of <a href="http://aomin.org/">Alpha &amp; 
Omega Ministries</a> on Tuesday, April 3rd, 2007:</p>

<p>Dr. White,<br>
<br>
I commend you on your <a href="http://www.aomin.org/podcasts/20070403fta.mp3">critique</a> 
[.mp3] of the <a>recent <i>Catholic 
Answers Live</i></a><a> program on Scripture and Tradition. Catholic Tradition 
clearly is not sustainable as a divinely inspired source of God's word. But 
doesn't that put you in a bit of a bind? Are you not a Sunday keeper who 
celebrates a Catholic Tradition every weekend? Where does inspired Scripture 
command the abandonment / replacement of the seventh day Sabbath Commandment of 
God with the keeping of Sunday?</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;... is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday and to abstain on 
  that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law 
  among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But, you may read the Bible 
  from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing 
  the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious observance 
  of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.&quot;</p>

Faith of Our Fathers</b></a></em>, by James Cardinal Gibbons,

republished and Copyright 1980 by TAN Books and Publishers, Inc., pages 72-73.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a>We agree that Catholic Tradition has no divine authority. Catholics have 
boldly asserted that Protestants who observe Sunday are squatters on the 
Catholic ground of Tradition, which they in principle reject. Are you not 
obedient to Catholic Tradition rather than the Ten Commandments, which by YOUR 
Sunday tradition you make of no effect [Matt. 15:3] &nbsp; </a><b>
