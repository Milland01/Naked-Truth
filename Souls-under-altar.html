<title>The Souls Under The Altar</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">The Souls Under The Altar</font><hr></p>
  
    <p>The following passage in the book of Revelation is often cited in support 
    of the belief that people are created with an immortal soul that survives in 
    a conscious state after death:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the 
    souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony 
    which they held:<br>
    Rev 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy 
    and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the 
    earth?<br>
    Rev 6:11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said 
    unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their 
    fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, 
    should be fulfilled.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Here you seemingly have John the revelator observing the conscious living 
    immortal souls 
    of martyred Christians in direct conversation with the Lord. Oddly enough, though, 
    these &quot;souls&quot; are seen <i>under</i> an altar. Where this altar is, is not 
    openly stated, but the assumption by those who believe in an immortal soul 
    is that this altar must be in the heavenly temple of God. For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;(1.) Where he saw them— <i>under the altar;</i> at the foot of the altar 
    of incense, in the most holy place; he saw them in heaven, at the foot of 
    Christ.&quot; <font face="Times New Roman">&#8213; <a href="http://www.ccel.org/h/henry/mhc2/MHC66006.HTM">Matthew Henry's Commentary on 
    Revelation 6:9.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Why the martyrs are described as being &quot;</font>under 
    the altar&quot;, Matthew Henry does not really explain adequately.<font face="Times New Roman"> Obviously, if this assumption is true, the 
    altar of incense in heaven must be extremely large in order for thousands of martyrs to 
    be there.&nbsp; </font>That would be a literal interpretation, 
     
    <font face="Times New Roman">and makes about as much sense as all the dead 
    saints literally going to Abraham's bosom (Luke 16:22), </font>but Revelation is a book full of symbols.<font face="Times New Roman"> </font> </p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">The First Martyr: Abel</font></u></p>
    <p>As a point of reference, it will be helpful to look first at the biblical 
    account of the first martyr, Abel:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when 
    they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew 
    him.<br>
    Gen 4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, 
    I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?<br>
    Gen 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood 
    crieth unto me from the ground.<br>
    Gen 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth 
    to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Abel's blood, <i>not Abel himself</i>, cried out to the Lord. Clearly this did 
    not happen in a literal sense. Abel's shed blood cried out <i>from the 
    ground</i> to the Lord <u>symbolically</u>, for justice to be done, for his 
    blood to be avenged, <u>just like in Rev 6:10</u>. </p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">Nephesh</font></u></p>
    <p>The book of Leviticus give us some interesting information about blood:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it 
    to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the 
    blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is the Hebrew word nephesh that gives us the key:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 17:11 For the life [H5315 nephesh] of the flesh is in the blood: and 
    I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: 
    [H5315 nephesh] for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul 
    [H5315 nephesh].</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The word nephesh occurs three times in that verse, and it is translated
    <i>life</i>, <i>souls</i>, and <i>soul</i>. So it would be just as proper to 
    translate the verse as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 17:11 <u>For the soul of the flesh is in the blood</u>: and I have 
    given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it 
    is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Nephesh, according to Strong's dictionary, also has the meaning of <i>breath</i>, so this is also valid:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 17:11 <u>For the breath of the flesh is in the blood</u>: and I have 
    given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it 
    is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now as most people will probably recognize, that is a medically correct 
    statement. The blood carries the oxygen from the lungs throughout the body. 
    The body's breath is literally carried in the blood! So this verse draws a parallel 
    between breath, soul, and blood. They are, in effect, synonymous in this 
    case. Note this Messianic prophecy in Isaiah:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he 
    shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul 
    [H5315 nephesh] unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and 
    he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Since the life is in the blood (Lev 17:11), it was Jesus' blood that was 
    poured out unto death at the cross.</p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">Psuche</font></u></p>
    <p>The word translated &quot;souls&quot; in Revelation 6:9 in the Greek is
    <i>psuche</i>, G5590 in 
    Strong's dictionary, which also has the meaning of <i>life</i> or<i> breath. </i>Since we have 
    concluded that the blood carries the life and breath in Leviticus 17:11, and 
    life, breath, 
    soul, and blood are synonymous in this case, the following is also a proper translation:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 6:9 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
    <u>blood</u> of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony 
    which they held:<br>
    Rev 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy 
    and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the 
    earth?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now verses 9 and 10 are coherent. It is the <i>shed blood</i> of the 
    martyrs that is seen &quot;under the altar&quot;, not  
    immortal bodiless souls. Just as Abel's blood cries out symbolically for 
    justice to the Lord, so does the blood of the martyrs &quot;under the altar&quot;. So, 
    just what does &quot;under the altar&quot; mean, and <i>where</i> is this altar. For 
    the answers we need to look at the altars of the Hebrew sanctuary or temple.</p>

    <p>In the above illustration, two altars are depicted. The altar of burnt 
    offerings in the outer court (2), and the altar of incense (6) in the first 
    apartment of the sanctuary, or holy place. </p>
  <p align="center"><u><font size="5">The Brazen Altar of Burnt Offering</font></u></p>
    <p>Now again, we have determined that Revelation 6:9 refers to the blood of 
    Christian martyrs as being &quot;under the altar&quot;. This expression 
    &quot;under the altar&quot; is explained by how 
    sacrificial blood was used in the sanctuary: Here is one example:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the 
    altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the 
    congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of 
    the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of 
    the congregation.</p>
    <p>(See also: Exo 29:12, Lev 4:18, 25, 30, 34, 5:9, 8:15, 9:9)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note that only a small amount of the blood of the sacrifice was  applied to the horns (at 
    the top) of the altar of incense, but, <u><i>most of it was poured out on 
    the ground at the bottom of the altar of burnt offerings.</i></u> Now as Christians are aware, the 
    animal sacrifices of the Hebrew sanctuary were symbolic for the sacrifice 
    and death of the lamb of God, those sacrifices represented the crucifixion 
    of Jesus Christ. The animal blood poured out at the bottom of the altar of 
    burnt offering was symbolic of the shed blood of Jesus Christ, spilled on 
    the ground <i><u>under the cross</u></i>! Therefore, the altar of burnt 
    offering is symbolic of Christ's sacrifice, which occurred on this earth. 
    (The Laver, which was between the altar of burnt offering and the entrance 
    to the sanctuary, symbolically represents baptism, which is also on this 
    earth.)</p>
    <p>Now note what Paul says about the saints of God:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And note what Jesus said to Paul, then Saul, on the road to Damascus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 22:7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, 
    <font color="#FF0000">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</font><br>
    Acts 22:8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, 
    <font color="#FF0000">I am 
    Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Saul was killing and persecuting Christians, yet Jesus accuses Saul of 
    persecuting Him! Then there is this, also from Jesus:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 25:40 <font color="#FF0000">And the King shall answer and say unto 
    them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the 
    least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So martyring Christians is spiritually like crucifying Christ anew, and 
    His blood was repeatedly poured out symbolically &quot;under the alter&quot; of burnt 
    sacrifice, which represented the cross, which was on this earth. </p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">The Golden Altar of Incense</font></u></p>
    <p>The altar of incense  however, 
    is in the heavenly sanctuary before the throne of God:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 8:1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in 
    heaven about the space of half an hour.<br>
    Rev 8:2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were 
    given seven trumpets.<br>
    Rev 8:3 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden 
    censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it 
    with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the 
    throne.<br>
    Rev 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the 
    saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.<br>
    Rev 8:5 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, 
    and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and 
    lightnings, and an earthquake.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>However, because the golden altar of incense never had sacrificial blood 
    poured out under it, it is not the altar spoken of in Rev. 6:9.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">Two Groups of Martyrs</font></u></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now note that there will clearly be <u>two</u> groups of martyrs.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 6:10 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy 
    and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the 
    earth?<br>
    Rev 6:11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said 
    unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their 
    fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, 
    should be fulfilled.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This 
    first group in Rev 6:9-11 are told they are to rest for a while until they 
    are joined by a second group of martyrs, which are also mentioned in 
    Revelation 14:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed 
    are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, 
    that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These Christian dead &quot;rest&quot; from their labors, asleep in their graves. 
    They are not alive as an immortal soul in heaven, A similar verse about Abel 
    being quite dead is found in Heb 11:4-</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than 
    Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of 
    his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">The Persecutor Drunken with the Blood of 
    the Saints</font></u></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The context of Revelation 14 (Mystery Babylon and the mark of the beast), 
    and the following verses in Revelation 17, 19 and 20 describe the persecutor 
    of the saints:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and 
    with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with 
    great admiration.</p>
    <p>Rev 19:2 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the 
    great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath 
    avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</p>
    <p>Rev 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was 
    given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the 
    witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the 
    beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their 
    foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a 
    thousand years.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Interestingly enough, Revelation 17 tells us there are <i>two</i> phases 
    of the &quot;beast&quot; which the woman rides:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:8 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out 
    of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the 
    earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from 
    the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is 
    not, and yet is.</p>
    </blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first group of Christian martyrs, the group that must rest a while, 
    are from the first persecution phase of the beast, the &quot;beast that was&quot;. The 
    second group of martyrs are to be martyred during the second phase of the 
    beast, the beast that &quot;yet is&quot;. </p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">The White Robes of Judgment</font></u></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 6:11 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said 
    unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their 
    fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, 
    should be fulfilled.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>The &quot;white robes&quot; are the righteousness of Jesus Christ (Isa 61:10) 
    otherwise spoken of as the &quot;wedding garment&quot; (Matt 22:11,12), and the 
    &quot;father's robe&quot; (Luke 15:22). So Rev 6:11 indicates that the righteous dead 
    are judged <i>prior</i> to the beginning of the second phase of persecution 
    of the saints by the woman riding the beast, the apostate church. This is 
    the beginning of what is called the pre-advent judgment which starts with 
    the house of God (1 Pet 4:17).</p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">Conclusion</font></u></p>
    <p>So by all of the above, we can conclude that in Revelation 6:9 it is the 
    blood of dead Christian martyrs that cries out symbolically, from where it 
    was shed: on the ground &quot;under the (brazen) altar (of burnt offering)&quot;, 
    which represents the cross, which is to say on the Earth, not in heaven.</p>
