  Echert censored the web address from my open letter, so as to prevent, or at 
  least hinder, his Catholic readers from finding and reading the above article

          <tr>
            <td width="100%">…first, let's begin with the following passage:
            <p>Rom 3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there 
            of circumcision? Rom 3:2 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto 
            them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
            <p>Now in the Roman Catholic Douay Rheims translation that reads: 
            Rom 3:1 What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of 
            circumcision? Rom 3:2 Much in every way. First indeed, because the 
            words of God were committed to them.</p>
            <p>So the word of God was committed originally to the Jews. As the 
            designated custodians of the inspired word of God, they knew which 
            books were canonical, and which were not, and they knew this without 
            the assistance of the yet to appear Catholic Church.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p align="center">++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
      <p>First I point out your inconsistency with regards to the manner in 
      which the sacred canon is known. For you accept that the Old Covenant Jews 
      collectively “knew which books were canonical” yet you reject that the New 
      Covenant Israel which is the Church—often referred to as the Catholic 
      Church—is likewise guided by divine Providence to “know which books are 
      canonical.” Do you really imagine that God guided Israel of old to know 
      the canon but failed to do so with regards to the New Israel?</p>
      <p>Secondly, you wrote the following:</p>
      <p align="center">++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
      <div align="center">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%" bgcolor="#F4F4FF" bordercolor="#000000" style="border-collapse: collapse">
          <tr>
            <td width="100%">Luke 24:44 And he said unto them, These are the 
            words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all 
            things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, 
            and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Luke 24:45 
            Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the 
            scriptures, Here in the above verse, Jesus divides the written word 
            of God into three categories. The Hebrew Bible, known by the acronym 
            TaNaKh, has these three divisions, first the Torah, the first five 
            books of Moses, second the Nevi'im or Prophets, and third the 
            Ketuvim or Writings. Christ was appearing to the disciples shortly 
            after His resurrection and He was expounding to His disciples on the 
            testimony of the scriptures about Himself, from one end of the Bible 
            to the other. From the beginning at Moses; next to the prophets; and 
            then on to the last division that began with Psalms; Christ 
            explained from the Hebrew Bible, the TaNaKh, how it revealed Him to 
            be the Messiah.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p align="center">+++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
      <p>It must be noted that simply by referring to three major categories of 
      types of writings of the Old Testament, this in no way precludes that 
      there may be other writings or types of writings. To use an analogy, if I 
      were to say that my mother and my father and my sister all testify that I 
      am a Roman Catholic priest, such does not preclude other family members or 
      other sources from affirming that same truth. Furthermore, the deutero-canonical 
      writings—wrongly referred to as the Apocrypha by some—can be fit into 
      these categories as readily as the modern Jews fit other writings into 
      them. For instance, Joshua and Judges are historical works and yet Jews 
      list them under the category of prophets. They are more properly 
      historical works and precede the prophetic period of Israel. What is your 
      basis for assuming that they belong under the category “prophets” apart 
      from modern Jewish preference? And the category of “the Writings” is so 
      loose as to allow the inclusion of such works as “Wisdom” and others.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, a careful study of the texts of the Old Testament which are 
      quoted in the New Testament reveals much more affinity with the texts of 
      the Greek Septuagint version of the Old Testament than any known Hebrew 
      text, most especially the Masoretic text which has been the basis of 
      biblical scholarship and translations for centuries, for Catholics and 
      Protestants. Unless you can produce a Hebrew text of the Old Testament 
      which accounts for such quotes in the New Testament (over 300) your 
      assumption should favor the use of the text of the Septuagint as the basis 
      for the New Testament. And the Septuagint, of course, contains the works 
      referred to as deutero-canonical.</p>
      <p>Finally, you cite the Dead Sea scrolls as important in establishing the 
      presence of Hebrew texts in Israel:</p>
      <p align="center">++++++++++++++</p>
      <div align="center">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%" bgcolor="#F4F4FF" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
          <tr>
            <td width="100%">While many have previously believed that Christ and 
            the Apostles used the Greek Septuagint because it was the common 
            tongue of the day, the recent discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at 
            Qumran proves conclusively that the Old Testament was available in 
            Hebrew in Israel at the time of Christ.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p align="center">++++++++++++++</p>
      <p>Of course, the Essence community that made use of these texts comprised 
      isolationists who did not associate with mainstream Judaism; in fact, they 
      did not regard Temple worship as legitimate and cannot be regarded as 
      normative with regards to their texts. But more to the point, if you wish 
      to use the Dead Sea Scrolls as important in establishing what was used in 
      Israel at the time of Christ, then by your own admission in your text you 
      should acknowledge and accept at least two of the deutero-canonical works 
      which were found in fragment parts at Qumran. As you wrote:</p>
      <p align="center">++++++++++++++++++</p>
      <div align="center">
        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%" bgcolor="#F4F4FF" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
          <tr>
            <td width="100%">No Jewish source versions of the Septuagint are 
            known to exist today, fueling speculation that the apocryphal books 
            may never have been a part of the original Jewish produced Greek 
            manuscript, but were only included in subsequent Christian copies. 
            The caves of Qumran, in which were found all of the canonical books 
            of the Old Testament except Esther, also contained fragments of 
            chapter 6 of the apocryphal Ecclesiasticus [Wisdom of Jesus the Son 
            of (Ben) Sirach] in Hebrew, found in Cave 2, and a fragment of Tobit 
            in Aramaic, found in Cave 4.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p align="center">+++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
      <p>The bottom line, Michael, is that without the Sacred Tradition of the 
      Church, not only would the canon of the Bible remain uncertain but it is 
      likely that at least some of the works would have been lost or mixed 
      amidst so many other apocryphal writings from the ancient Jewish and 
      Christian world. To justify the elimination of the deutero-canonical works 
      you basically have to reject the councils and great Scriptural writers 
      such as St. Augustine from at least as early as the fourth century AD. I 
      invite you to reconsider you position. ©</p>

      <p>There is no inconsistency on my part at all. Up until the time of 
      Christ the Hebrew canon was known, though no church council had formally 
      declared it. Consistency, if you demand it, would not require a formal 
      declaration of either the New or Old Testament canon by any Catholic 
      council.</p>
      <p>It is clear from the 3 passages cited from the New Testament in my 
      article that Christ defined the Hebrew canon as the inspired scriptures of 
      His time. This automatically excludes the Apocryphal books from canonical 
      consideration. The responsibility of the Christian church was to collect 
      and preserve the inspired doctrinal, historical and prophetic writings of 
      the apostolic era, and it could have done this just like the Jews, without 
      a single Catholic council or papal declaration.</p>
      <p>Now the issue of who has the authority to define and declare the canon 
      of scripture is academic when both Protestant and Catholic agree on the 
      content of the New Testament. However, when it comes to the Old Testament 
      canon, where there is a discrepancy, can there be any higher authority 
      than the words of Christ Himself?</p>

      <p>God has not failed. The same canon that Christ knew and referred to 3 
      times is acknowledged by Protestantism today as the complete Old 
      Testament. If anyone has failed, it was the councils and popes of the 
      Catholic Church who erred regarding the Old Testament canon.</p>

      <p>The theoretical placement of Joshua or Judges in either the Prophets or 
      Writings does have any relevance to this discussion. What matters are the 
      three divisions of the Hebrew Bible, and the first and last books as 
      referred to by Christ. These simply cannot be applied to the Septuagint.</p>
      <p>As additional evidence, I would suggest that the following verses all 
      refer to the first two divisions of the Hebrew Bible when they cite the 
      Law and the Prophets. These 11 verses, by the way, are quoted from the 
      Roman Catholic Douay Rheims translation:</p>
      <p>Mat 5:17 Do not think that I am come to destroy the law, or the 
      prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.</p>
      <p>Mat 7:12 All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do 
      to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</p>
      <p>Mat 11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John:</p>
      <p>Mat 22:40 On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the 
      prophets.</p>
      <p>Luke 16:16 The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the 
      kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.</p>
      <p>Luke 24:44 And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to 
      you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, 
      which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the 
      psalms, concerning me.</p>
      <p>John 1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him: We have found him 
      of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus the son of 
      Joseph of Nazareth.</p>
      <p>Acts 13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the 
      rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Ye men, brethren, if you 
      have any word of exhortation to make to the people, speak.</p>
      <p>Acts 24:14 But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which 
      they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all 
      things which are written in the law and the prophets:</p>
      <p>Acts 28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came very many 
      to him unto his lodgings; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of 
      God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the 
      prophets, from morning until evening.</p>
      <p>Rom 3:21 But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, 
      being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</p>

      <p>Not true. Matt. 23:35 and Luke 11:51 both make clear that Christ was 
      referring to 2nd Chronicles as the very last book in the inspired 
      Scriptures. This agrees with the current and historical Hebrew Bible. But 
      most notably, the cited verses can never be reconciled with the altered

      <p>It is indeed recognized today that many of the New Testament quotes of 
      Old Testament verses are citations of the Greek Septuagint. This does not, 
      however, lead to the conclusion that the New Testament writers accepted 
      the canon of the Septuagint, for the following reasons:</p>
      <p>As Greek was a common language of the day, I will concede that the 
      Apostles likely taught from scrolls of the Septuagint for their Greek 
      speaking audiences.</p>
      <p>However, were I a Jew or Gentile in the first century who spoke both 
      Hebrew and Greek fluently, and my audience likely knew Greek but maybe not 
      Hebrew, I too would not hesitate to teach and cite from a Greek 
      translation of the Hebrew canon, like the Septuagint, even if it may have 
      collectively contained some extraneous non-canonical works. I as a 
      Protestant sometimes cite from the Catholic Douay Rheims (as I have done 
      above) or other Catholic editions of the Bible, because it suits my 
      purpose to make a point to a Catholic in their own translation. However, 
      this does not in any way mean that I endorse the Catholic canon, or 
      presumed Catholic authority to declare the canon. In like manner, 
      apostolic era use of the Greek Septuagint in no way constitutes an 
      endorsement of the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books.</p>
      <p>So the assumption that the New Testament writers accepted the Catholic 
      canon, simply because they quoted from the Septuagint, lacks any merit.</p>

      <p>I said the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran proves 
      conclusively that the Old Testament was available in Hebrew in Israel at 
      the time of Christ. I did NOT say Qumran made a case for canonicity. There 
      were dozens of non-canonical works at Qumran, and the presence, or 
      absence, of a particular book in the Qumran collection does not provide 
      one iota of proof for, or against, canonicity. Even if all the Apocryphal 
      books of the Septuagint had been found at Qumran, this would NOT establish 
      their acceptance as part of the canon. Qumran was a LIBRARY, which likely 
      collected every religious scroll it could get possession of or duplicate. 
      My own personal library contains many Catholic works, to include Catholic 
      catechisms and several Catholic Bibles, but this does not make me a

      see, I have been well within my legal rights to repost my discussion with 
      Fr. Echert on my web site, since it easily fits ALL these requirements.</p>
      <p>4. Also, since I believe that the Roman Catholic Church is the Mystery 
      Babylon spoken of by John in Revelation, I have a clear moral and 
      religious obligation to preach this truth as best I can, so that people

      apostate church. Since you, as Vice President of EWTN, have in your

      <p>Also, please note point 4 [2] of the fair use clause:</p>
      <p>2) the nature of the copyrighted work;</p>
      <p>Due to the nature of my inquiry of Fr. Echert, and his responses, which 
      involves a scholarly debate, it was patently unfair for him to censor the 
      web address of my article, since he chose to voluntarily post my inquiry 
      and respond to it. That web address was the only way some EWTN readers 
      would be able to gain access to the article Fr. Echert was responding to, 
      in order to judge for themselves the merits of my position. I will not be 
      guilty of the same blatant unfairness on my web site. No true scholar 
      interested in a free exchange of opposing ideas would even contemplate 
      it.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Fr. Echert and EWTN have an undeniable right, in fairness, to have his 
      entire remarks available in the same article as my comments in response to 
      him. Any court would likely agree fully in this specific case. I expected 
      the same sense of fair play, justice, and charity in the EWTN site that I 
      rigidly follow on my web site, but I did not get it. That you are now 
      attempting to remove Fr. Echert's responses from my web site only 
      reinforces that fact.</p>
      <p>Please heed the following counsel from the Apostle Paul:</p>
      <p>1 Cor 6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law 
      before the unjust, and not before the saints?<br>
      1 Cor 6:2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the 
      world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest 
      matters?<br>
      1 Cor 6:3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things 
      that pertain to this life?<br>
      1 Cor 6:4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set 
      them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.<br>
      1 Cor 6:5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man 
      among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?<br>

      <p>If you still feel you have been wronged by me in this matter, then take

      <br>
      I would like to refer you to Fr. Echert's forum and the following email he 
      has posted from Anna on 07-20-2001: <font size="2" face="Arial Narrow">
      http://www.ewtn.com/vexperts/showmessage.asp?Pgnu=1&amp;Pg=Forum7&amp;recnu=8&amp;number=213779<br>
      [Deleted on 23 July at EWTN]</font>
      <p>This is a most interesting development. Fr. Echert, who has been quite 
      unable to logically rebut my article on the Hebrew Canon, has sunk to 
      posting ad hominem that characterizes me as a demon possessed hate monger 
      in need of psychiatric help. Is this the level of debate you encourage and 
      condone at EWTN as a Vice President?</p>
      <p>Now I am not suggesting for a moment that this item be removed, since I 
      would never try to censor EWTN. PLEASE, let it remain, since it only helps 
      me make my case against Catholicism to the discerning reader, Protestant 
      and Catholic alike. I am positively AMAZED that Fr. Echert is apparently 
      unable to see this. It does make me wonder if he will post any emails he 
      may have received from Catholics that are critical of his censorship. 
      Would I be permitted to respond to this, and any similar email posted in 
      his forum?</p>
      <p>Should you choose to reply, I will add it after this email on my web 
      page at: http://biblelight.net/hebrew-canon.htm</p>

EWTN Capitulates and Removes All Related Forum Entries.</font></u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As a result of the above email, EWTN on 23 July edited its Scripture Forum 
  as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The bulk of Anna's remarks, mentioned above, have been edited out, 
    leaving just two sentences. To anyone reading that item now, there is no 
    hint at all that her remarks have been edited in any way at all. I doubt 
    that anyone will find this practice acceptable. When remarks have been 
    edited, it should be apparent to the reader exactly when and where editing 
    has occurred.</li>
    <li>The title of Anna's post, as well two others, were changed from my name 
    to Sacred Scriptures.</li>
    <li>Most significantly, Fr. Echert's second reply to me, that had been 
    posted on <a href="#19july">07-19-2001</a>, where he admitted to censoring 
    my point by point responses in order to protect his readers, has been 
    deleted <i>entirely</i> by EWTN. Now it seems to the Catholic visitor to the 
    Scripture Forum that I have never responded to Fr. Echert's initial posting 
    on <a href="#16july">7-16-2001</a> which, curiously, remains on EWTN's site, 
    apparently unchanged. This erroneously leaves the impression that Fr. Echert 
    has won the discussion by default. Could anything be more unfair than this?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>On 24 July, Anna's post was totally deleted along with another that 
  referred to my posts, as well as Fr. Echert's initial reply to my inquiry. Now
  <i>everything</i> related to my inquiry to EWTN has been expunged from the 
  Scripture forum. The reason is obvious. Leaving anything at all in the 
  Scripture forum was simply unacceptable and would&nbsp; provoke further 
  discussion, and questions that EWTN would not be able to answer. There is only 
  one way to view this, a complete capitulation on the part of EWTN on the topic 
  of the Hebrew Canon, that my article on the <a href="hebrew-canon.html">Hebrew 
  Canon</a> is true, and totally beyond their capability to refute. This is so 
  serious a threat to Catholicism, in their view, that <i>nothing</i> could be 
  allowed to remain on the EWTN forum regarding it. It is as if it never 
  happened, but many Catholics know it did, and they know why EWTN felt 
  compelled to remove it.</p>

  great is fallen, ...</p>

      <p>I agree that the ad hominem from Anna that Fr. Echert posted in his

      my experience has been that it is all too common for Catholics to react 
      that way in such discussions.</p>

      <p>I initiated the discussion with Fr. Echert, and from the very beginning

      and any reply would be published on my web site. Now your &quot;good will&quot;, as 
      you put it, was nothing short of an attempt to censor my web site after 
      the discussion was going very badly for EWTN, on a topic you recognize to 
      be of immense consequence to Catholicism, and not one you could afford to 
      publicly lose.</p>
      <p>You simply cannot allow Catholic readers access to the simple facts of 
      this discussion because you fully realize you have nothing that will stand 
      up in comparison to Christ's own very clear words. In effect, you have cut 
      your losses through censorship on your own site, bailing out of a 
      discussion that you perceive as a lost cause.</p>
      <p>You also want any evidence of EWTN participation removed from my site 
      as well, in order to conceal your inability to respond effectively. Your 
      actions will be perceived by everyone as an acknowledgment on EWTN's part 
      that you cannot refute the point I have raised, and know well the 
      inevitable consequence: that the Catholic canon of the Old Testament is in 
      error, and magisterial &quot;infallibility&quot; of Popes and Church Councils is 
      nothing but a pious fraud.</p>

      <p>On the contrary, Christ and the Apostles had no problem at all 
      identifying the canon of Scripture, as my essay shows quite clearly, long 
      before the Council of Jamnia. That you want to divert attention from the 
      easily discerned meaning of the cited verses comes as no real surprise.</p>
      <p>In recent years Catholic apologists have made the claim that nowhere in 
      scripture is the canon defined, and that this in their opinion, was surely 
      a fatal blow to Sola Scriptura. Just in the last few hours I saw Fr. Levis 
      and Fr. Trigilio make the same faulty argument on EWTN. I think there is a 
      certain poetic justice in having that proved so conclusively wrong that 
      all &quot;infallible&quot; Catholic Tradition falls inevitably after the simple 
      truth regarding the Old Testament canon is known.</p>
      <p>Does this leave Catholics adrift without an anchor on which to rely? 
      No. It just confirms the absolute authority of Scripture as the sole ruler 
      for doctrine, which has no peers in Popes, or Councils, or the Traditions 
      of men. Only Scripture is our inspired infallible teacher.</p>

      <p>Under the circumstances, I would never expect you to accept the Council

      authority to itself. In any case, I do not rest my argument on the Council 
      of Jamnia, but rather on the very sure foundation of the words of Christ, 
      cited in the New Testament. Those quotes have an authority that exceeds 
      any council, and are something you simply cannot refute.</p>

      <p>The whole point of my essay addresses certainty, absolutely ironclad 
      certainty pertaining to the Old Testament canon. I would respectfully 
      submit that the words of Jesus Christ Himself show, quite clearly and 
      quite irrefutably, that the Hebrew canon was regarded by Him to be the 
      full extent of inspired scripture in His time. This excludes the 
      Apocryphal books from canonical consideration, and is proof positive that 
      &quot;infallible&quot; Popes and Church councils have erred in this regard.</p>
      <p>Now if you still disagree, you are publicly, openly, and cordially

      Christ's day, and proclaimed by the Lord Himself, is just not historically 
      accurate. For instance the reference in Lk. 24:44 to the Law, the Prophets 
      and the Psalms refers in the first place to places in Sacred Scripture 
      where prophecies of Christ are given. It is also a clear liturgical 
      reference which every Jew would recognize, since Torah and haftorah 
      readings in the synagogue were, and still are, taken from these books. He 
      makes no mention of the Writings (except for Psalms). In Christ's day the 
      historical, moral and wisdom literature were widely considered inspired, 
      but not universally so. They were seldom used in the synagogue. Christ' 
      reference is no more a complete canon than His listing of commandments in 
      Mt 19:18 is a complete Ten Commandments.
      <p>As for Jamnia's canon, it was drawn up in contradistinction to the 
      developing Christian Scriptures and theology. It can hardly be considered 
      authoritative, or even representative of first century Judaism, to 
      Christians. Why would Christians look to the People of the Old Law for 
      their canon, when the fallibility of their traditions was clearly 
      identified but Jesus. The Scriptures, correctly identified are not 
      fallible, but the human judgment about what constitutes them, and how they 
      are to be interpreted, is. Post-Exilic Judaism and Protestantism are 
      sufficient proof of the error of private judgment. Only by means of a 
      supernatural charism committed to the Church (as represented in Peter), as 
      opposed to the leaven of the several Pharisee (and thousands of 
      Protestant) theologies, can an authoritative canon be identified and an 
      authoritative judgment about Scripture's meaning be proclaimed (Mt 
      16:5-18). Christ spoke with authority, and so does the Church. Mankind is 
      free to take them or leave them. But as Augustine said, &quot;No one can have 
      God as His Father who does not also have the Church as His Mother&quot; … &quot;if 
      he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and

      <p>P.S. Spare your readership your condescending insights into what other 
      people mean, or the absolute certainty of your logical conclusions. Its 
      poor scholarship. Unless you have a charism of infallibility, yrou

        <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make 
        war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, 
        and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now I would suggest that my essay on the Hebrew canon is based quite 
      securely on the testimony of Jesus Christ, while you are appealing instead 
      to unbiblical Tradition. And as to keeping the commandments of God, we 
      Seventh-day Adventists observe the seventh day of the week (Saturday) as a 
      Sabbath day of rest, just as Exodus 20:8-11 declares. This Catholics 
      clearly don't do, since they pride themselves in their changing this 
      precept of God, making Sunday, the first day of the week, the day of 
      worship and rest. This change Catholics also admit, is not based on any 
      command found in Scripture, but rather on the Church's sense of its own 
      power and authority, being rooted in nothing more than Tradition. So, 
      based on Holy Scripture, you are not lining up with the characteristics 
      delineating the true church.</p>

      <p>In Matthew 19:18-19 Jesus mentions the last 6 Commandments of the 
      second table of the Decalogue regarding our duty to mankind, and those not 
      mentioned cover our duty to God. Now do you think it would have been 
      necessary for Christ to list them all for His audience to fully understand 
      what He was talking about, or did His audience know exactly and precisely 
      what He meant? Without question they knew, since Jesus was referring to 
      something that was long standing and well known, the 10 Commandments given 
      to Moses at Sinai. The fact that He did not mention them all does not 
      permit the possibility that He could have been referring to some other 
      nebulous list that included additional commandments, beyond the ten, as 
      your position would logically require.</p>
      <p>In a similar manner, there is simply no way Luke 24:44-45, Matt. 23:35 
      and Luke 11:51 can be applied to anything but the Hebrew canon, which is 
      precisely what Christ's audience understood Him to be speaking about 
      (explained in next paragraph).</p>

      <p>You seem to be overlooking a very important point. In Luke 24:44-45, 
      Christ mentions Psalms, obviously pertaining to a third division of 
      Scripture, and Psalms is the first and largest book of that division. 
      Next, in Matt. 23:35 and Luke 11:51, the reference to Zechariah is plainly 
      referring to the last book of Scripture, which in the Hebrew Bible is 2 
      Chronicles. So when these three verses are considered together, Christ has 
      defined the third division of Old Testament Scripture as beginning at 
      Psalms and ending with 2 Chronicles. Here is the logical result of what 
      Christ said:</p>
      <div align="center">
        <table border="2" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="95%">
          <tr>

      <p>Now this conclusion is plainly evident, and quite precise, <b><i>and

      the Greek Septuagint, which is radically different [<a href="hebrew-canon.html">see 
      article</a>].</p>
      <p>So if Christ is indeed your highest authority on this matter, then the 
      inevitable result is quite clear, the canon of the Catholic Church is in 
      error, and it must be rejected, along with &quot;infallible&quot; Popes and Councils 
      who in error affirmed the Apocryphal books as canonical. That argument is 
      so simple and logical as to be quite irrefutable.</p>

          <tr>
            <td width="100%">But lets be honest with your readers, as a Seventh 
            day Adventist you can no more accept that the early Church received 
            the Canon orally from Christ and the Apostles than you can accept 
            that Sunday is the Day of the Lord in Acts 20:7 and Rev. 1:10.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>If you are suggesting that the Apocrypha were passed on by Christ via 
      oral Tradition, you are correct, that is unacceptable, since it clearly 
      contradicts the written record of Christ's teaching in the New Testament.</p>
      <p>Now, as to the phrase &quot;day of the Lord&quot;, it appears 25 times in 
      scripture, in 23 verses, but I will cite just one passage:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Zep 1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth 
        greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry 
        there bitterly.<br>
        Zep 1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a 
        day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day 
        of clouds and thick darkness,</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now I would respectfully suggest that &quot;day of the LORD&quot; here, as 
      elsewhere in scripture, is clearly a reference to the day of the second 
      coming of Jesus Christ, and not Sunday.</p>
      <p>Regarding Acts 20:7, it will apparently surprise you to know that I 
      concede that the first day of the week is indeed Sunday. That is not in 
      dispute by anyone that I know of. The question is whether or not &quot;breaking 
      bread&quot; on that day constituted a communion service, and can be used as 
      evidence that the disciples were keeping Sunday. On that issue, I will 
      quote a Catholic publication:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Let us call attention to the same Acts 2d chapter, 46th verse: &quot;And 
        they, continuing daily in the temple, and breaking bread from house to 
        house,&quot; etc. Who does not see at a glance that the text produced [Acts 
        20:7] to prove the exclusive prerogative of Sunday, vanishes into thin 
        air — an ignis fatuus — when placed in juxtaposition with the 46th verse 
        of the same chapter? What the Biblical Christian claims by this text for 
        Sunday alone, the same authority, St. Luke, informs us was common to 
        every day of the week: &quot;And they, continuing daily in the temple, and 
        breaking bread from house to house.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So the fact that they were breaking bread on the first day of the week 
      proves nothing, since Acts 2:46 shows this was done daily. Sunday 
      sacredness simply finds no support in Acts 20:7, and Catholics have freely 
      admitted this.</p>
      <p>On Revelation 1:10, and the expression &quot;Lord's day&quot;, I quote the same 
      Catholic source as above</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Has St. John used the expression [Lord's day] previously in his 
        Gospel or Epistles? — Emphatically, NO. Has he had occasion to refer to 
        Sunday hitherto? —Yes, twice. How did he designate Sunday on these 
        occasions? Easter Sunday was called by him (John 20:1) &quot;the first day of 
        the week.&quot; Again, chapter twenty, nineteenth verse: &quot;Now when it was 
        late that same day, being the first day of the week.&quot; Evidently, 
        although inspired, both in his Gospel and Epistles, he called Sunday 
        &quot;the first day of the week.&quot; On what grounds, then, can it be assumed 
        that he dropped that designation? Was he more inspired when he wrote the 
        Apocalypse, or did he adopt a new title for Sunday, because it was now 
        in vogue? A reply to these questions would be supererogatory especially 
        to the latter, seeing that the same expression had been used eight times 
        already by St. Luke, St. Paul and St. Peter, all under divine 
        inspiration, and surely the Holy Spirit would not inspire St. John to 
        call Sunday the Lord's day, whilst He inspired Sts. Luke, Paul, and 
        Peter, collectively, to entitle the day of judgment &quot;the Lord's day.&quot;</p>
        <p>See: <a href="chalng.html"><b>ROME'S CHALLENGE - Why Do Protestants 
        Keep Sunday?</b></a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now the <i>Catholic Mirror</i>, quoted above, was the official organ of 
      Cardinal Gibbons and the Papacy in the United States, and it eloquently 
      makes the case that neither &quot;day of the LORD&quot; or &quot;Lord's day&quot; ever refer 
      to Sunday in scripture, but rather to the second coming of Christ. It 
      concludes that Sola Scriptura Protestants should either keep the seventh 
      day (Saturday) holy as the Bible plainly teaches, or abandon Protestantism 
      and the Bible as their only rule of faith to join the Catholic Church in 
      its Tradition of Sunday keeping. I could not agree more.</p>

      Palestinian and Diaspora Jews quite considerably. You cannot make a case 
      for an evident Canon based on Christ's words. If it requires 
      interpolating, as you do, then it is a poor standard. Christ does not give 
      poor standards, He provided a Church, which interpreted in His name and by 
      His authority, as they did regarding whether the Mosaic law extent (Acts 
      15). As for the Decalogue, to list the commandments regarding man, (6 in 
      Exodus, 7 in Deuteronomy), is still to give a partial list. The young 
      man's question was which commandments must he keep to enter eternal life – 
      apparently not those regarding God. Since that can't be true, Christ was 
      giving a representative list. He didn't need to spell everything out 
      because He did not leave His people at the mercy of their own private and 
      incomplete interpretation of His words, but left them authoritative 
      interpreters in His apostles, and those whom they appointed to succeed 
      them as &quot;overseers&quot; (bishops) of the Church.
      <p>As for Saturday or Sunday, your position entails the absurd contention 
      that all early Christians, including the thousands of martyrs for Christ 
      during the imperial persecutions, were in error in celebrating Sunday, 
      that the disciples of Christ turn a left turn as soon as the apostles 
      died, and everyone was in error until modern Sabbatarians came along. You 
      are entitled to your position. However, please admit that it has as its 
      basis only your church's 18 centuries after the fact interpretation of 
      Scripture.</p>
      <p>Again, your claims to the self-evident meaning of Scripture, when you 
      can drive a Volkswagen through the holes in your logic, begs the question 
      of the correctness of your interpretation. YOU must prove, logically, 
      syllogistically, your position, without &quot;deus ex machina&quot; filling I nof 
      the meaning. Literal words, not interpolations, please. I need not. Mine 
      rests on the authority of the Apostolic Tradition. Scripture witnesses 
      sufficiently to Catholic claims; witnesses, not proves. The Church like 
      Christ speaks with authority, it doesn't proof-text. Peter, like Christ, 
      is a stumbling stone (skandalon), upon which many rise or fall.</p>

      <p>Much of Christ's teaching was in the form of parables, which by their 
      nature were not immediately understood by many who heard them, and He was 
      asked about this:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Mat 13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest 
        thou unto them in parables?<br>
        Mat 13:11 He answered and said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Because 
        it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but 
        to them it is not given.</font><br>
        Mat 13:12 <font color="#FF0000">For whosoever hath, to him shall be 
        given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from 
        him shall be taken away even that he hath.</font><br>
        Mat 13:13 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore speak I to them in parables: 
        because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they 
        understand.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So what you are calling a poor standard was the <i>intentional</i> 
      teaching method of Christ, used to divide sheep from goats.</p>

          <tr>
            <td width="100%">As for the Decalogue, to list the commandments 
            regarding man, (6 in Exodus, 7 in Deuteronomy), is still to give a 
            partial list. The young man's question was which commandments must 
            he keep to enter eternal life – apparently not those regarding God. 
            Since that can't be true, Christ was giving a representative list. 
            He didn't need to spell everything out because He did not leave His 
            people at the mercy of their own private and incomplete 
            interpretation of His words, but left them authoritative 
            interpreters in His apostles, and those whom they appointed to 
            succeed them as &quot;overseers&quot; (bishops) of the Church.</td>

      <p>You are suggesting that in order for anyone to understand what Christ 
      was referring to in Matt 19:18-19, it is necessary for everyone to consult 
      with a priest simply because not every commandment was mentioned. Is this 
      what the man did? Was the man in doubt, and in need of a priest to tell 
      him what commandments were meant?</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Mat 19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what 
        good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<br>
        Mat 19:17 And he said unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Why callest thou 
        me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt 
        enter into life, keep the commandments.</font><br>
        Mat 19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, <font color="#FF0000">
        Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not 
        steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,<br>
        Mat 19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy 
        neighbour as thyself.</font><br>
        Mat 19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept 
        from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Obviously the man knew exactly what commandments Christ was referring 
      to. He did not need the remaining commandments recited for clarity, so 
      this passage actually speaks against your position.</p>
      <div align="center">

          <tr>
            <td width="100%">As for Saturday or Sunday, your position entails 
            the absurd contention that all early Christians, including the 
            thousands of martyrs for Christ during the imperial persecutions, 
            were in error in celebrating Sunday, that the disciples of Christ 
            turn a left turn as soon as the apostles died, and everyone was in 
            error until modern Sabbatarians came along. You are entitled to your 
            position. However, please admit that it has as its basis only your 
            church's 18 centuries after the fact interpretation of Scripture.</td>

      <p>I would maintain that history shows there have always been those who 
      kept the seventh day (Saturday) Sabbath, since the time of Christ, and 
      that Sunday keeping only developed gradually over time, but was completely 
      unknown to the Apostolic church.</p>

            <td width="100%">Again, your claims to the self-evident meaning of 
            Scripture, when you can drive a Volkswagen through the holes in your 
            logic, begs the question of the correctness of your interpretation. 
            YOU must prove, logically, syllogistically, your position, without &quot;deus 
            ex machina&quot; filling I nof the meaning. Literal words, not 
            interpolations, please. I need not. Mine rests on the authority of 
            the Apostolic Tradition. Scripture witnesses sufficiently to 
            Catholic claims; witnesses, not proves. The Church like Christ 
            speaks with authority, it doesn't proof-text. Peter, like Christ, is 
            a stumbling stone (skandalon), upon which many rise or fall.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>The strongest evidence that I can offer that you don't really believe 
      that, that you have little confidence in your argument, is the censoring 
      of my discussion from Fr. Echert's Scripture forum. This action is clearly 
      intended to prevent Catholics from reading my essay on the Hebrew canon, 
      because once they read and understand it, you will have a major 
      credibility problem on your hands. Fr. Echert implied as much, when he 
      said in his post of 19 July:</p>
      <div align="center">
        <table border="2" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFE6">
          <tr>
            <td width="100%">Not only did I delete your web address in the 
            previous post but I have deleted your arguments in this post, which 
            may mislead the Faithful who are in full communion with the Church.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>So if my argument is full of holes, and this could be proved 
      conclusively, you would undoubtedly be quite willing to set me straight 
      before your EWTN Scripture Forum readers, so that what you believe to be 
      the superior Traditions of the Roman Catholic Church could be exhibited 
      publicly, and a Bible believing, commandment keeping Adventist, relying on 
      the testimony of Jesus Christ, shown to be sadly misguided. Why don't you 
      do that? I think your censorship of EWTN speaks louder than your words, 
      that even in your own estimation people will clearly see that Jesus Christ 
      endorsed the Hebrew Canon of the Old Testament, to the automatic exclusion 
      of the Apocryphal books, thus proving the &quot;infallible&quot; Catholic 
      Magisterium a myth, and that is why you cannot permit this discussion, or 
      even a link to it, to be available on EWTN's scripture forum.</p>
      <p>Again this is a public discussion, and this email and your reply, if 
      any, will be posted on my web site.</p>

      then must He have intended an accepted Canon as He intended an accepted 
      Decalogue? There is no necessity there. The Decalogue was settled 1200 
      years earlier with Moses and was contained within recognized Scripture, 
      the Torah. The books used in the synagogue, with which Jews would have 
      been familiar, were the Torah, the Prophets and Psalms. The 
      recognizability of His reference was clear, to liturgical use, not a 
      settled canon. AND, among the various parties of Jews – Sadducces, 
      Pharisees, Essenes - there were different opinions, as well. The Sadducees 
      limited their canon to the Torah. Other books, not generally used in the 
      synagogue, were later accepted by both Jews and Christians as Scripture. 
      Both Eastern and Western Christians, that is Orthodox and Catholics, 
      accepted a broader canon than rabbinical Jews, medieval descendants of the 
      Pharisee party, who naturally accepted the Pharisee opinion from Jamnia. 
      To canonize that post-Christian opinion as the mind of Christ, or even of 
      Palestinian Jews of Christ's day, has no basis.
      <p>In the situation of the uncertain 1st century Canon Christ either told 
      His apostles what it consisted in, or, He left it for the mission of the 
      Holy Spirit in and through the Church, as was done in many other things, 
      such as the applicability of the Mosaic Law to Christians (Acts 15). 
      Clearly this is an unacceptable position for you, since it contradicts the 
      Adventist theory of history that the whole Church went astray in the first 
      century until Seventh Day Adventism came along. Well, that's a theory, and 
      you are entitled to it. As you say, let your readers judge.</p>
      <p>Thank you for an engaging dialogue. Since we tend to be repeating

      we can go with it. But, do as you must.</p>

      <p>Scripture warns repeatedly of apostasy entering into the church, even 
      in the apostolic era of the church, and it is plain that this apostasy 
      would soon overwhelm the church at large, developing into the Antichrist 
      power described as the little horn of Daniel, the beast from the sea in 
      Revelation 13, and persecuting harlot riding the beast in Revelation 17. 
      The following passages are warnings of the inevitable apostasy in the 
      church:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Amos 8:11 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send 
        a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but 
        of hearing the words of the LORD:<br>
        Amos 8:12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even 
        to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and 
        shall not find it.</p>
        <p>Mat 7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's 
        clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>
        <p>Mat 24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</p>
        <p>Acts 20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, 
        over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the 
        church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<br>
        Acts 20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous 
        wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<br>
        Acts 20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse 
        things, to draw away disciples after them.<br>
        Acts 20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three 
        years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</p>
        <p>Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you 
        into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
        Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and 
        would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
        Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel 
        unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
        Gal 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any 
        other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
        <p>2 Th 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not 
        come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be 
        revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
        2 Th 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, 
        or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, 
        showing himself that he is God.</p>
        <p>1 Tim 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times 
        some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and 
        doctrines of devils;<br>
        1 Tim 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared 
        with a hot iron;</p>
        <p>2 Tim 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound 
        doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves 
        teachers, having itching ears;<br>
        2 Tim 4:4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall 
        be turned unto fables.</p>
        <p>2 Pet 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even 
        as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in 
        damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring 
        upon themselves swift destruction.<br>
        2 Pet 2:2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom 
        the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.</p>
        <p>Jude 1:3 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the 
        common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort 
        you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once 
        delivered unto the saints.<br>
        Jude 1:4 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of 
        old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our 
        God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord 
        Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>Rev 2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast 
        left thy first love.<br>
        Rev 2:5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and 
        do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will 
        remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>
        <p>Rev 2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because 
        thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, 
        to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat 
        things sacrificed unto idols.<br>
        Rev 2:21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she 
        repented not.<br>
        Rev 2:22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit 
        adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their 
        deeds.<br>
        Rev 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches 
        shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will 
        give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, contrary to these scriptures, the Catholic Church teaches that it 
      has been protected from apostasy, that it has never taught error, and 
      never will teach error. This notion of an infallible Catholic Magisterium 
      is not taught anywhere in scripture, and as my essay shows, it is proved a 
      pious fraud on the point of the Hebrew canon being endorsed by Jesus 
      Christ.</p>
