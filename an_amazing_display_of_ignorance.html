      <P align=left><FONT size=3>Your statement "Besides, many Protestants don't 
      accept James at all as inspired Scripture precisely because of your cited 
      verse requiring works" is just flat out wrong and I am curious as to what 
      you base it on. The Protestants I hang out with hold James as highly as 
      any other book in Scripture.

      <P align=left><FONT size=3>Shawn, All or most of the Bibles printed for 
      Protestant usage omit the Epistle of James from their New Testament list, 
      following the decision of Martin Luther who claimed this Epistle was merely 
      one of straw. However, many of these Bibles list this Epistle separately 
      as an apocryphal work. God bless. Fr. Bob Levis </FONT><BR><BR><FONT

  <p>Can you believe it? This is what passes for an &quot;expert&quot; answer in
  Catholic apologetics! Needless to say, Fr. Levis likely never opened a
  Protestant Bible before making such a patently absurd statement. I think they
  need better experts at EWTN.</p>
  <p>On the 24th, Fr. Levis was called to account for his ridiculous statement,
  and he then admitted <i>he does not even own a Protestant Bible, and he really
  has no idea what is in Protestant Bibles</i>! Amazing! Here is the item
  (since deleted):</p>

      <P align=left><FONT size=3>Fr. in almost 40 years of regular Scripture 
      study using both Catholic and Protestant translated Bibles of which I have 
      a copy of most English translations, and in any and all commentary or 
      teaching I have heard or read, the book of James (which follows the book 
      of Hebrews in all Bibles) is considered inspired by all. The only 
      questions I have read concerning it stem from comments by Martin Luther 
      but never repeated by any others that I have heard/read in almost 40 
      years. I do not believe you will not find a Protestant believer, minister 
      or lay, who would say that James is not part of the canon of Scripture. 
      Please document for us anything that definitively says otherwise.

      <P align=left><FONT size=3>Dear Megan, All Bibles in my library are 
      Catholic and so unfortunately I can't tell you what other Protestant 
      Bibles say. If you, as a Protestant, find the Epistle of St. James in your 
      Protestant Bible, congratulations, I am very happy that James is included. 
      Historically, this Epistle was not so easily included in the New Testament 
      Canon. God bless you. Fr. Bob Levis</FONT><BR><BR><FONT
