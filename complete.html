<center><b><font size="5">Proof the Bible is <em>Not</em> Complete in Doctrine?</font></b></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here is a favorite verse quoted by Catholics to support Church Tradition,
  which by definition, are doctrines not to be found within the covers of any
  Bible-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 21:25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the
    which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world
    itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Well, there it is. Absolute indisputable proof that not all doctrines Jesus
  taught are included in scripture! Imagine all the teaching Jesus might have
  done that simply was not included in the Bible. Who can tell, maybe we <em>are
  </em>supposed to pray to Mary and Saints. Maybe Mary <em>is </em>the
  Immaculate Virgin and Queen of Heaven. Who could deny that these and other
  doctrines of Tradition might just be true, but are part of the unrecorded
  doctrines this verse speaks of?</p>
  <p>If you encounter this kind of Catholic logic then direct them to the
  following verses-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 20:30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
    disciples, which are not written in this book:<br>
    John 20:31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
    Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
    name.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Well this puts a different light on the same subject doesn't it! Here John,
  the very same author, is saying that the Bible contains everything you need to
  come to a saving faith. Clearly John is saying that by believing in Jesus
  Christ (faith) you are saved (have life). John has seen to it that a
  sufficient number of Jesus' miracles are recorded that you <em>can</em> come
  to believe in Him and be saved. John speaks of some of what Jesus <em>did</em>
  as being unrecorded, signs, miracles, etc., but does not even hint at
  unrecorded doctrines essential for salvation, in fact he adequately refutes
  such a notion.</p>
  <p>So, rather that having a hole (21:25) big enough to drive a truck through
  (filled with unbiblical doctrines), the book of John completely closes off any
  attempt to introduce spurious doctrines under the guise of Tradition
  (20:30-31). Not even a church mouse can get through!</p>
  <p>Curious thing about the Catholic Doctrines of Mary, some of them have been
  declared by the church to be articles of faith. That is to say that you can
  not be saved if you fail to accept them (at least if you claim to be
  Catholic). Isn't this in direct opposition to what John is saying in chapter
  20:30-31? Indeed it is! According to John, everything needed for a saving
  faith IS written down in scripture!</p>
