All Creatures?</font></strong></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note the following passages from
  inspired scripture:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Colossians</font> 1:12 <font
    face="Times New Roman" size="3">(KJV)</font> Giving thanks unto the Father,
    which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
    light:<br>
    Col 1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
    translated us into the kingdom of <strong>his dear Son:</strong><br>
    Col 1:14 <strong>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
    forgiveness of sins:</strong><br>
    Col 1:15 <strong>Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of
    every creature:</strong><br>
    Col 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
    are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions,
    or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:<br>
    Col 1:17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.<br>
    Col 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning,
    the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
    preeminence.</p>
    <p>Heb 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past
    unto the fathers by the prophets,<br>
    Heb 1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
    appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<br>
    Heb 1:3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
    person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by
    himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;<br>
    Heb 1:4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance
    obtained a more excellent name than they.<br>
    Heb 1:5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son,
    this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he
    shall be to me a Son?<br>
    Heb 1:6 And again, when he bringeth in <strong>the firstbegotten</strong>
    (firstborn) into the world, he saith, And <strong>let all the angels of God
    worship him</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above passages of inspired scripture speak of the Son of the Father,
  Jesus Christ, as the firstborn of every creature, the creator of all things,
  who is to be worshipped even by the angels. The firstborn held a place of
  special preeminence, and Jesus Christ, as the firstborn incarnate Son of God
  the Father, holds this title above <em>all</em> of humanity, without any
  exception.</p>
  <p>Now <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">compare the following quote from
  an Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII, <em>Augustissimae Virginis Mariae</em>:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">1. Whoever considers the height of
    dignity and glory to which God has raised the Most August Virgin Mary, will
    easily perceive how important it is, both for public and for private
    benefit, that devotion to her should be assiduously practised, and daily
    promoted more and more.</font></p>
    <p align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mary's Place
    in the Incarnation and Redemption</font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">2. God predestined her from all
    eternity to be the Mother of the Incarnate Word, and for that reason so
    highly distinguished her among all His most beautiful works in the triple
    order of nature, grace and glory, that <strong>the Church justly applies to
    her these words: &quot;I came out of the mouth of the Most High, the
    first-born before all creatures&quot; </strong>(Ecclus. xxiv., 5). And when,
    in the first ages, the parents of mankind fell into sin, involving their
    posterity in the same ruin, she was set up as a pledge of the restoration of
    peace and salvation.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Source: Encyclical <em><strong><a
    href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13AUGUS.htm">AUGUSTISSIMAE VIRGINIS
    MARIAE</a></strong></em> (On the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary) of Pope
    Leo XIII, dated September 12, 1897.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The book that Pope Leo XIII quotes from is not in most Protestant bibles,
  as it is from the apocryphal book of <em>Ecclesiasitcus</em>, otherwise known
  as <em>Sirach</em>. Can you see what has happened? The inspired word of God
  calls Jesus Christ the firstborn of every creature, but according to Pope Leo
  XIII, the Catholic church says no, <em>not</em> Jesus, but <em>Mary</em> is
  the firstborn of all creatures! Who cannot see that this is blasphemy and
  antichrist, pure and simple?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the
    horn spake:<br>
    Dan 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, ...</p>
    <p>Rev 13:5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
    blasphemies; ...</p>
    <p>Rev 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
    saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy,
    ...</p>
