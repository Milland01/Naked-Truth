<title>Does Sola Scriptura Fail Because There Are Thousands of Protestant

  <p align="center"><b><font size="6">Does Sola Scriptura <i>Fail</i><br>
  </font><font size="5">Because There Are <i>Thousands</i> of Protestant 
  Denominations?</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>When discussing the Protestant slogan of Sola Scriptura, the <i>Bible only</i> 
  for doctrine, Catholics will commonly assert something like the following: 
  Since there are literally <i>thousands</i> of different Protestant sects and 
  denominations, having quite different interpretations of scripture, this 
  proves that Sola Scriptura is obviously an unworkable failure, since God is <i>
  not</i> the author of confusion. The assertion is that if Sola Scriptura were 
  true, and working successfully, only one interpretation or understanding of 
  any given doctrine would be clearly evident to all, and that interpretation 
  would be universally taught and practiced, without any deviations.</p>
  <p>Noah spent 120 years building the ark (Gen 6:3), and preached to a doomed 
  and dying world as he was building. Yet, after so many years of preaching, 
  only 8 people entered into the ark (Gen 7:13, 1 Pet 3:20). Was Noah a <i>
  failure</i> at preaching the word of God because so few were saved and 
  uncounted thousands were lost?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 55:6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while 
    he is near:<br>
    Isa 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his 
    thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; 
    and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br>
    Isa 55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my 
    ways, saith the LORD.<br>
    Isa 55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher 
    than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br>
    Isa 55:10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and 
    returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and 
    bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:<br>
    Isa 55:11 <b>So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall 
    not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it 
    shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Noah was a faithful servant and prophet of God, and so was speaking for God 
  to his generation, and as indicated in Isa 55:11, <i>God's word does not fail 
  to accomplish His purpose</i>. Noah successfully accomplished the task set 
  before him by God, and <i>all</i> the righteous of the earth entered into the 
  completed ark, though it was only eight people, and <i>all</i> the wicked 
  perished. The measure of Noah's success was NOT how few were saved, and 
  neither was the comparatively large number of those lost an indication of 
  failure on his part or on the part of God. The real question is what 
  percentage of the faithful and righteous were saved? Since God and His word do 
  not fail in His purpose, 100% of the righteous were saved and 100% of the 
  wicked were lost, and that is the measure of success: 100%. None of the truly 
  righteous will be lost (John 17:12, 18:9), and all of the wicked will surely 
  perish, even though the righteous will be vastly outnumbered by the wicked:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:13 <font color="#FF0000">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide 
    is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many 
    there be which go in thereat:</font><br>
    Mat 7:14 <font color="#FF0000">Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the 
    way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>During His ministry on earth, Jesus many times publicly taught by using 
  parables (Matt 13:3) to illustrate important spiritual truths, and sometimes 
  even His disciples needed to ask Jesus to explain a parable's meaning (John 
  10:6). At times, even when speaking clearly, without using parables, Jesus was 
  not immediately understood by His disciples:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them,
    <font color="#FF0000">The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and 
    they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third 
    day.</font><br>
    Mark 9:32 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
    <p>Luke 9:43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while 
    they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his 
    disciples,<br>
    Luke 9:44 <font color="#FF0000">Let these sayings sink down into your ears: 
    for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</font><br>
    Luke 9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, 
    that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Was Jesus a failure because His disciples did not immediately understand 
  what he was saying?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you 
    when he was yet in Galilee,<br>
    Luke 24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful 
    men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br>
    Luke 24:8 And they remembered his words,<br>
    Luke 24:9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto 
    the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
    <p>John 14:29 <font color="#FF0000">And now I have told you before it come 
    to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There are times when it suits God's purpose that His words NOT be 
  understood at the time they are spoken, but rather at a later time. On one 
  occasion, Jesus was even opposed in what He was trying to teach by the apostle 
  Peter:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, 
    how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and 
    chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.<br>
    Mat 16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far 
    from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.<br>
    Mat 16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, <font color="#FF0000">Get thee 
    behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the 
    things that be of God, but those that be of men.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>After telling the parable of the sower to a great multitude, Jesus was 
  approached by His disciples in private, who asked Him why He found it 
  necessary to teach in parables, and the answer He gave is quite revealing:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 13:9 <font color="#FF0000">Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</font><br>
    Mat 13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto 
    them in parables?<br>
    Mat 13:11 He answered and said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Because it 
    is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to 
    them it is not given.</font><br>
    Mat 13:12 <font color="#FF0000">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, 
    and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be 
    taken away even that he hath.</font><br>
    Mat 13:13 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore speak I to them in parables: 
    because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they 
    understand.<br>
    Mat 13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By 
    hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, 
    and shall not perceive:</font><br>
    Mat 13:15 <font color="#FF0000">For this people's heart is waxed gross, and 
    their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any 
    time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should 
    understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal 
    them.</font><br>
    Mat 13:16 <font color="#FF0000">But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and 
    your ears, for they hear.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 4:9 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">He that hath ears 
    to hear, let him hear.</font><br>
    Mark 4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve 
    asked of him the parable.<br>
    Mark 4:11 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Unto you it is given 
    to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, 
    all these things are done in parables:</font><br>
    Mark 4:12 <font color="#FF0000">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; 
    and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should 
    be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 8:8 ... <font color="#FF0000">He that hath ears to hear, let him 
    hear.<br>
    </font>Luke 8:9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable 
    be?<font color="#FF0000"><br>
    </font>Luke 8:10 And he said, <font color="#FF0000">Unto you it is given to 
    know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that 
    seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Was the measure of Jesus' success at teaching, the number of people that <i>
  understood perfectly</i> what He was saying, or was His failure measured by 
  the number of people that walked away without understanding? No, those who had 
  &quot;ears to hear&quot; would understand. Those, who for whatever reason did not want 
  to hear, did not understand. The apostle Paul also explains why this is so:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him 
    [Paul] into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of 
    God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out 
    of the prophets, from morning till evening.<br>
    Acts 28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed 
    not.<br>
    Acts 28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after 
    that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the 
    prophet unto our fathers,<br>
    Acts 28:26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and 
    shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:<br>
    Acts 28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are 
    dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with 
    their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and 
    should be converted, and I should heal them.<br>
    Acts 28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent 
    unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 2:12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the 
    spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given 
    to us of God.<br>
    1 Cor 2:13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom 
    teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with 
    spiritual.<br>
    1 Cor 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of 
    God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because 
    they are spiritually discerned.</p>
    <p>Heb 4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but 
    the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them 
    that heard it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The word of God is clearly not intended to be understood by everyone:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 12:10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the 
    wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the 
    wise shall understand.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Scripture is, in fact, a method of separating the sheep from the goats, so 
  to speak, a way of separating those with &quot;ears to hear&quot; from those who do not 
  want to hear. Scripture does not fail in its purpose of instructing the 
  &quot;sheep&quot; simply because there are so many goats that do not understand, because 
  the sheep <i>will</i> hear, and <i>will</i> understand, at the appointed time 
  that suits God's purpose. Sola Scriptura, the Bible only for doctrine, 
  similarly cannot be labeled an unworkable failure because so many Protestants 
  disagree on points of doctrine, for the simple reason that not all Protestants 
  are sheep, though they may claim to be, and may even <i>appear</i> to be 
  sheep:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:15 <font color="#FF0000">Beware of false prophets, which come to 
    you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 7:21<font color="#FF0000"> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, 
    Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of 
    my Father which is in heaven.<br>
    </font>Mat 7:22<font color="#FF0000"> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, 
    Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out 
    devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>
    </font>Mat 7:23<font color="#FF0000"> And then will I profess unto them, I 
    never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.<br>
    </font>Mat 7:24<font color="#FF0000"> Therefore whosoever heareth these 
    sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which 
    built his house upon a rock:<br>
    </font>Mat 7:25<font color="#FF0000"> And the rain descended, and the floods 
    came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it 
    was founded upon a rock.<br>
    </font>Mat 7:26<font color="#FF0000"> And every one that heareth these 
    sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, 
    which built his house upon the sand:<br>
    </font>Mat 7:27<font color="#FF0000"> And the rain descended, and the floods 
    came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great 
    was the fall of it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 15:4 <font color="#FF0000">What man of you, having an hundred sheep, 
    if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the 
    wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</font><br>
    Luke 15:5 <font color="#FF0000">And when he hath found it, he layeth it on 
    his shoulders, rejoicing.</font><br>
    Luke 15:6 <font color="#FF0000">And when he cometh home, he calleth together 
    his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have 
    found my sheep which was lost.</font><br>
    Luke 15:7 <font color="#FF0000">I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be 
    in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine 
    just persons, which need no repentance.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The sheep <i>will</i> hear Jesus' voice through His word, and follow Him, 
  and <i>not one</i> of the sheep will be lost. Sola Scriptura is <i>not</i> an 
  unworkable failure, because God's word simply <i>cannot</i> fail. So, those 
  that have ears to hear, let them hear and understand what inspired scripture 
  says.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 10:14 <font color="#FF0000">I am the good shepherd, and know my 
    sheep, and am known of mine.</font><br>
    <br>
    John 10:24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long 
    dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.<br>
    John 10:25 Jesus answered them, <font color="#FF0000">I told you, and ye 
    believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of 
    me.</font><br>
    John 10:26 <font color="#FF0000">But ye believe not, because ye are not of 
    my sheep, as I said unto you.</font><br>
    John 10:27 <font color="#FF0000">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, 
    and they follow me:</font><br>
    John 10:28 <font color="#FF0000">And I give unto them eternal life; and they 
    shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</font><br>
    John 10:29 <font color="#FF0000">My Father, which gave them me, is greater 
    than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</font></p>
