<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most misinterpreted passages in Bible prophecy 
  today. Virtually all your hear today about end time events hinges on the 
  correct interpretation of these few verses. I will present what I believe to 
  be the correct interpretation, which is quite different from what you 
  generally hear.</p>
  <p><b>Dan 9:24</b></p>
  <p>This verse sets the goals of the 70 week prophecy of Daniel.</p>
  <p>(A) &quot;Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,&quot;</p>
  <p>- This sets the time period at 70 weeks. It is generally accepted here that 
  you must use the day = year prophecy formula (Num 14:34, Ezek 4:6), yielding a time period of 490 
  years from start to completion.</p>
  <p>- The word determined here actually means &quot;cut off&quot;. This 70 weeks are cut 
  off from, or begin at the same time as, the larger 2300 day (year) prophecy of 
  Dan 8:14, which has as it's focus the cleansing of the sanctuary in heaven, 
  the beginning of Judgment. So both the 70 week (490 year) and the 2300 day 
  (year) prophecy begin at the same date. Note that you can not arbitrarily 
  apply the year for a day principle in one case and not another, you must 
  remain consistent. Dan 8:26 strongly hints that the 2300 day prophecy in verse 
  14 is not just 2300 days, but many days more than it literally indicates. This 
  would also support using year instead of day.</p>
  <p>(B) &quot;to finish the transgression (rebellion),&quot;</p>
  <p>- Meaning to the Jews: end your transgression of (rebellion against) God's 
  Law and return to obedience.<br>
  - Alludes to the victory of Jesus Christ over transgression at the cross.</p>
  <p>(C) &quot;and to make an end of sins,&quot;</p>
  <p>- Meaning to the Jews: repent from sin.<br>
  - Alludes to the victory of Jesus Christ over sin at the cross.</p>
  <p>(D) &quot;and to make reconciliation for iniquity,&quot;</p>
  <p>- Meaning to the Jews: Atonement for sins through sacrificial temple 
  ceremonies (symbolic of Jesus).<br>
  - Alludes to the reconciliation for iniquity by Jesus Christ at the cross.</p>
  <p>(E) &quot;and to bring in everlasting righteousness,&quot;</p>
  <p>- Alludes to the death of Jesus the Messiah at the cross making everlasting 
  righteousness available to all with faith. Without His death at the cross we 
  are all condemned to the second death. By His death on the cross, the 
  requirement of the Law was met and His everlasting righteousness established. 
  Psa 119:142</p>
  <p>(F) &quot;and to seal up the vision and prophecy,&quot;</p>
  <p>- To fulfill / complete the prophesies of the 70 weeks (the dates of 
  Messiah's / Jesus' baptism and crucifixion). Because Daniel predicted these historical events of the 70 weeks with 
  absolute accuracy, we can also trust that the 2300 day (year) prophecy is just 
  as accurate.</p>
  <p>(G) &quot;and to anoint the most Holy.&quot;</p>
  <p>- As the earthly temple was anointed in Lev 8:10-11, so the heavenly temple 
  was anointed by Jesus as he assumed the role of our High Priest, on his return 
  to heaven. Also, Jesus himself was anointed as the Messiah at His Baptism (Mat 
  3:16, Mark 1:9, Luke 3:21).</p>
  <p>So verse 24 has set the goals of the 70 week prophecy of Daniel. The 
  twofold focus of the prophecy: first on the Jews reconciling themselves with 
  God within the appointed time (490 years), and second, Jesus being baptized 
  and paying the price of sin at the cross for us and becoming our High Priest. 
  Note that there is nothing in verse 24 referring to the millennial kingdom, or 
  the antichrist, or a seven year tribulation and there is nothing to indicate 
  the 490 years are anything but a continuous period of time that ended in 34 
  A.D.</p>
  <p><b>Dan 9:25</b></p>
  <p>(A) &quot;Know therefore and understand, that&quot;</p>
  <p>(B) &quot;from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build 
  Jerusalem&quot;</p>
  <p>- There were actually four commands issued that can be located in scripture 
  and must be considered:</p>
  <p>(1) Ezra 1:1-14, 1st year of Cyrus, dated to 537 B.C.<br>
  (2) Ezra 6:1-12, 2nd year of Darius dated to 520 B.C.<br>
  (3) Ezra 7:1-27, 7th year of Artaxerxes dated to 457 B.C.<br>
  (4) Neh 2:1-8, 20th year of Artaxerxes dated to 444 B.C.</p>

  <p>Given the generally accepted age of 30 for Jesus (Luke 3:23) at His baptism 
  in the 15th year of Tiberius (Luke 3:1) which can be independantly and firmly established as 27 A.D., 
  only one of the decrees fits, that being the 3rd decree given in Ezra 7 in the fall 
  of 457 B.C.* The others are either too early or too late to be the command 
  referred to. The decree in Ezra 7 (vs. 23-26), permits civil and religious 
  autonomy to be restored in Jerusalem in compliance with God's law, fulfilling 
  Daniel's prophecy. So starting in the fall of 
  457 B.C.  places the end of the 70 weeks, or 490 years, in the fall of 34 A.D., 
  placing the year of the crucifixion, (which happened in the middle of the 70th 
  week of Daniel), at the Spring of 31 A.D..</p>

  <p>- Using this same starting date of the fall of 457 B.C. for the 2300 day (year) 
  prophecy of Dan 8:14, you arrive at the fall of 1844 A.D. as the date for the 
  start of Judgment in heaven (the cleansing of the sanctuary). In the Temple 
  ceremonies of the Jews, this event occurred only once each year, at Yom 
  Kippur, a type for judgment day. It has been underway in heaven since 1844 and 
  continues at this moment. This is why at the second coming there appears to be 
  no judgment - the Saints both living and dead meet Jesus in air (the rapture) 
  and accompany him to the New Jerusalem in heaven, there to reign with Jesus 
  for the 1000 years (John 14:2-3). For more information on the timing of the 
  second advent rapture, see 
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b>
  <a href="psttrib.html">The truth about the rapture</a>.</b></p>
  <p>(C) &quot;unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and 
  two weeks:&quot;</p>
  <p>- After 69 weeks the Messiah will be anointed by God as such. This happened 
  at the Baptism of Jesus by John when the Holy Spirit descended as a dove and 
  God the father announced Jesus as his Son (Acts 10:37-38). The end of the 69 weeks is 
  mentioned by Jesus in Mark 1:15 when He says &quot;The time is fulfilled&quot;. Counting 
  down 69 weeks of years (483) from the fall of 457 B.C. you arrive at the fall 
  of 27 A.D. for the baptism of Jesus. Futurists generally try to 
  tie this event to the triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Yet Jesus entry into 
  Jerusalem was NOT when He was first recognized as the Messiah, except perhaps 
  by the people of Jerusalem. God the Father and the Holy Spirit anointed him as 
  the Messiah at his Baptism - the entry into Jerusalem pales in comparison to 
  this holy event.</p>
  <p>(D) &quot;the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous 
  times.&quot;</p>
  <p>- The rebuilding of Jerusalem would be rebuilt despite opposition. (Ezra 
  4:4,5 and Neh 4 + 6)</p>
  <p><b>Dan 9:26</b></p>
  <p>(A) &quot;And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not 
  for himself:&quot;</p>
  <p>- Following the 62 weeks, the Messiah would be crucified for our sins. The 
  62 weeks, as we saw in verse 25 above, ended in His baptism. The exact time of 
  the crucifixion is not specified here, but it is in verse 27. In effect, this 
  is saying that the crucifixion will follow the anointing.</p>
  <p>(B) &quot;and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city 
  and the sanctuary;&quot;</p>
  <p>- Jesus is the prince that shall 
  come. The unbelieving Jews through their rebellion against God and Roman rule, 
  brought about the destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem in 70 A.D. by the 
  Roman general Titus, crushing the Jewish rebellion, fulfilling this prophecy. 
  The unbelieving Jews had rejected the ultimatum contained in the 70 week 
  prophecy, and their destruction and scattering in 70 A.D. was the result. </p>
  <p>- Some think the prince that shall come may apply to Titus, who tried to 
  protect the Temple, but his soldiers destroyed it anyway against his explicit 
  orders. Titus did not confirm any covenant, however, Jesus did (see below) .&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(C) &quot;and the end thereof shall be with a flood,&quot;</p>
  <p>- According to contemporary historians, the destruction of Jerusalem and 
  the Temple was swift like a flood.</p>
  <p>(D) &quot;and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.&quot;</p>
  <p>- One interpretation continues to apply this to the war with Rome and the 
  destruction of 70 A.D.</p>
  <p>- It may also mean that until the end of the war with Satan and sin, 
  Jerusalem and the Temple will be desolate (lack the presence of God), their 
  house being desolate - Mat 23:38 and Luke 13:35. To date this appears to be 
  the case. See also verse 27(C).</p>
  <p><b>Dan 9:27</b></p>
  <p>(A) &quot;And he [Jesus] shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:&quot;</p>
  <p>- Some would claim that the &quot;he&quot; could not refer to Jesus since his 
  ministry on earth was only 3 1/2 years in length. They try to apply this to 
  the antichrist (the prince who shall come in verse 26) and a 7 year peace 
  treaty (covenant) with the Jews. Note the following, verses in red were spoken 
  by Jesus-</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>- During this 70th week, the Gospel was preached only to the Jews.</p>
  <p>- The event that ends the 70 weeks is the stoning of Stephen as found in 
  Acts 7:59. At that point the Gospel was no longer preached 
  exclusively to the Jews, Peter and Paul having been shown by vision to begin 
  preaching to Gentiles (Acts 10 &amp; 22:17-21). (See also Acts&nbsp; 11:18, 13:46, 14:27, 15:9, 
  18:6). The Jews are no longer the exclusively chosen people of God (Gal 3:28). 
  See also the parable of Mark 12:1 and Luke 20:9. The original husbandmen (the 
  Jews) of the vineyard are rejected, and replaced, never to tend the vineyard 
  again. This does not mean they have been rejected as individuals. They can 
  still be saved by faith in Jesus like anyone else. Promises made to the Jewish 
  nation have been rejected by the Jews due to their unbelief, so the 
  fulfillment of those promises will be made to those of faith, regardless of 
  national origin (Gal 3:29).</p>
  <p>- So the final week of the 70 week period left to the Jews continues 
  unbroken from the baptism of Jesus in 27 A.D. thru to 34 A.D., to confirm and 
  fulfill (seal up) the prophecy of Daniel.</p>
  <p>(B) &quot;and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the 
  oblation to cease,&quot;</p>
  <p>- In the middle of the week, in 31 A.D., Jesus is crucified, bringing an 
  end to the symbolic temple sacrifices, which were a type (shadow) of his 
  sacrifice at the cross. This is confirmed by the tearing of the veil in the 
  Temple at the instant of his death, exposing the most holy place (Mat 27:51, 
  Mark 15:38, Luke 23:45) signaling the end of the typical earthly sacrificial 
  priesthood and the begining of.the priestly ministry of Jesus. The fact that 
  Temple ceremonies continued until 70 A.D. is irrelevant. </p>
  <p>(C) &quot;and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, 
  even until the consummation,&quot;</p>
  <p>- The temple in Jerusalem will remain desolate, lacking the presence of 
  God, until the end of time. (Mat 23:38-39, Luke 13:35)</p>
  <p>- Whether the Jews rebuilt the temple or not is irrelevant. It will remain 
  in desolation. In fact, rebuilding the Temple and a resumption of Temple 
  sacrifices would be the ultimate manifestation of unbelief and a complete 
  rejection of Jesus Christ, the Messiah. It would be an abomination.</p>
  <p>(D) &quot;and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.&quot;</p>
  <p>- This has an initial application with the destruction of Jerusalem and the 
  Temple in 70 A.D. The Roman armies first surrounded Jerusalem in 66 A.D. and 
  then withdrew for some unexplained reason. The believing Jews understood Mat 
  24:15 to apply to them and they fled the city at this opportunity. The Roman 
  armies soon returned and laid siege to Jerusalem, resulting in it's fall in 70 
  A.D. At that time thousand of Jews were slaughtered, not one of them was 
  Christian. So this part of verse 27 finds fulfillment in 70 A.D. It may also 
  be interpreted that Jerusalem and the temple will remain desolate of God until 
  the execution of Judgment on the wicked, beginning with the last 7 plagues. 
  That is to say Jesus will not dwell with His people until He does so after the 
  second coming when the righteous dead are raised and the living are 
  transformed, and they all join Him in the clouds (Rev 21:22).</p>

	<p>Note that unlike futurists, this interpretation does not find any 
  reference to the Antichrist, or a 7 year peace treaty signed with the Jews, or 
  a broken peace treaty / desecration of the Temple by the antichrist, or a 7 
  year tribulation. I think the evidence presented here shows that the focus of 
  the 70 weeks of Daniel is a fixed 490 year ultimatum to the Jews and a 
  prediction of the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus, as well as pointing to the 
  <a href="judgment.html">start of judgment</a> at the end of the 2300 years. Since the Jews did not repent 
  of their transgressions, and rejected the Christ, their Temple and city were 
  destroyed and the survivors scattered. So now the Gospel is preached to one 
  and all, which began at the end of the 70th week, in 34 A.D.</p>
  <p>Note this excerpt from the respected Presbyterian minister
  <a href="http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php3?authorID=schaff&amp;bookID=encyc05&amp;page=229">
  Matthew Henry's</a> Commentary, dated 1708-1710:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The book of Daniel 9,
    <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/MatthewHenryConcise/mhc-con.cgi?book=da&amp;chapter=009">
    Verses 20-27</a></p>
    <p>An answer was immediately sent to Daniel's prayer, and it is a very 
    memorable one. We cannot now expect that God should send answers to our 
    prayers by angels, but if we pray with fervency for that which God has 
    promised, we may by faith take the promise as an immediate answer to the 
    prayer; for He is faithful that has promised. Daniel had a far greater and 
    more glorious redemption discovered to him, which God would work out for his 
    church in the latter days. Those who would be acquainted with Christ and his 
    grace, must be much in prayer. The evening offering was a type of the great 
    sacrifice Christ was to offer in the evening of the world: in virtue of that 
    sacrifice Daniel's prayer was accepted; and for the sake of that, this 
    glorious discovery of redeeming love was made to him. We have, in verses ( 
    24-27 ), one of the most remarkable prophecies of Christ, of his coming and 
    his salvation. It shows that the Jews are guilty of most obstinate unbelief, 
    in expecting another Messiah, so long after the time expressly fixed for his 
    coming. The seventy weeks mean a day for a year, or 490 years. About the end 
    of this period a sacrifice would be offered, making full atonement for sin, 
    and bringing in everlasting righteousness for the complete justification of 
    every believer. Then the Jews, in the crucifixion of Jesus, would commit 
    that crime by which the measure of their guilt would be filled up, and 
    troubles would come upon their nation. All blessings bestowed on sinful man 
    come through Christ's atoning sacrifice, who suffered once for sins, the 
    just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. Here is our way of 
    access to the throne of grace, and of our entrance to heaven. This seals the 
    sum of prophecy, and confirms the covenant with many; and while we rejoice 
    in the blessings of salvation, we should remember what they cost the 
    Redeemer. How can those escape who neglect so great salvation!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As you can see from the above quote, Matthew Henry, a Protestant writing in 
  the early 18th century, knew nothing of a gap between the 69th and 70th week, 
  and he knew nothing of a 7 year peace treaty with the antichrist in verse 27.</p>
  <p>The futurist interpretation of this passage denies the prophecy of Jesus' 
  baptism in verse 24. It also denies His crucifixion in verse 27 and applies it 
  instead to the antichrist, in an astounding twisting of scripture. I submit 
  the futurist's house is built on sand and will not stand scrutiny. They do not 
  have a case, they have a relatively recent fairy tale designed to obscure the 
  truth and spread confusion, whether they know it or not. The author of that 
  futurist fairy tale is the Catholic Church, specifically a Spanish Jesuit 
  priest by the name of Francisco Ribera (1537-1591). During the 
  counterreformation he concocted the futurist interpretation to deflect 
  reformist claims that the Papacy was the Antichrist of scripture. There is 
  apparently no evidence that the futurist interpretation predates the Catholic 
  counterreformation. It was intended as a smoke screen, and it still works 
  today to a large degree.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that, generally speaking, the same people that 
  advocate the pretribulation rapture also hold to the futurist interpretation 
  of Dan 9:24-27. Both are spurious interpretations, fables, that only confuse 
  and deceive. Again, I do not wish to offend anyone, I am simply trying to let 
  you see through the smoke, and see the truth.</p>
