  the Dead.</font></b></center>
  <hr align="left">
  <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">On December 19,
  1513, in connection with the eighth session of the fifth Lateran Council, Pope
  Leo X issued a Bull (<i><a href="#apostolici regiminis">Apostolici regimis</a></i>)
  declaring, &quot;We do condemn and reprobate all who assert that the
  intelligent soul is mortal&quot; (Damnamus et reprobamus omnes assertentes
  animam intellectivam mortalem esse). This was directed against the growing
  &quot;heresy&quot; of those who denied the natural immortality of the soul,
  and avowed the conditional immortality of man. The Bull also decreed that
  &quot;all who adhere to the like erroneous assertions shall be shunned and
  punished as heretics.&quot; The decrees of <i>this</i> Council, it should be
  noted, were all issued in the form of Bulls or constitutions (H. J. Schroeder,
  <i>Disciplinary Decrees of the General Councils</i>, 1937, pp. 483, 487).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1516 Pietro Pomponatius, of Mantua, noted Italian professor
  and leader among the Averrorists (who denied the immortality of the soul),
  issued a</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 570]</font></font></p>
  <p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">book in opposition to this
  position called <i>Treatise on the Immortality of the Soul</i>. This was
  widely read, especially in the Italian universities. As a result, he was haled
  before the Inquisition, and his book publicly burned in Venice.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Then, on October 31, 1517, Luther posted his famous Theses on the
  church door in Wittenberg. In his 1520 published Defence of 41 of his
  propositions, Luther cited the pope's immortality declaration, as among
  &quot;those monstrous opinions to be found in the Roman dunghill of
  decretals&quot; (proposition 27). In the twenty-seventh proposition of his
  Defence Luther said:</font></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I permit the
    Pope to establish articles of faith for himself and for his own faithful—such
    are: That the bread and wine are transubstantiated in the sacrament; that
    the essence of God neither generates nor is generated; that the soul is the
    substantial form of the human body that he [the pope] is emperor of the
    world and king of heaven, and earthly god; <i>that the soul is immortal</i>;
    and all these endless monstrosities in the Roman dunghill of decretals—in
    order that such as his faith is, such may be his gospel, such also his
    faithful, and such his church, and that the lips may have suitable lettuce
    and the lid may be worthy of the dish.—Martin Luther, <i>Assertio Omnium
    Articulorum M. Lutheri per Bullam Leonis X. Novissimam Damnatorum</i>
    (Assertion of all the articles of M. Luther condemned by the latest Bull of
    Leo X), article 27, Weimar edition of Luther's Works, vol. 7, pp. 131, 132
    (a point-by-point exposition of his position, written Dec. 1, 1520, in
    response to requests for a fuller treatment than that given in his <i>Adversus
    execrabilem Antichristi Bullam</i>, and <i>Wider die Bulle des Endchrists</i>).</font></p>

  in his <i>Short Historical View of the Controversy Concerning an Intermediate
  State</i>, of 1765:</font></p>
  <blockquote>

    doctrine of the sleep of the soul, upon a Scripture foundation, and then he

  <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The immediate cause of
  Luther's stand on the sleep of the soul was the issue of purgatory, with its
  postulate of the conscious torment of anguished souls. While Luther is not
  always consistent, the predominant note running all through his writings is
  that souls sleep in peace, without consciousness or pain. The Christian dead
  are not aware of anything—see not, feel not, understand not, and are not
  conscious of passing events. Luther held and periodically stated that in the
  sleep of death, as in normal physical sleep, there is complete unconsciousness
  and unawareness of the condition of death or the passage of time.</font><font

    likewise referred to Luther's position in these words:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Luther, with a greater emphasis on the resurrection,
    preferred to concentrate on the scriptural metaphor of sleep. For just as
    one who falls asleep and reaches morning unexpectedly when he awakes,
    without knowing what has happened to him &quot; we shall suddenly rise on
    the last day without knowing how we have come into death and through death.
    ''We shall sleep, until He comes and knocks on the little grave and says,
    &quot;Doctor Martin, get up! Then I shall rise in a moment, and be with him
    forever.' &quot;<br>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">until the day of resurrection.* which
  resurrection embraces both body and soul, when both will come together again.†<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Here are sample Luther citations. In the quaint 1573 English
  translation we read:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Salomon judgeth that
    the dead are a sleepe, and feele nothing at all. For the dead lye there
    accompting neyther dayes nor yeares, but when are awaked, they shall seeme
    to have slept scarce one minute.—<i>An Exposition of Salomon's Booke,
    called Ecclesiastes or the Preacher</i>, 1553, folio 151v.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; But we Christians, who have been redeemed from all this through
    the precious blood of God's Son, should train and accustom ourselves in
    faith to despise death and regard it as a deep, strong, sweet sleep; to
    consider the coffin as nothing other than our Lord Jesus' bosom or Paradise,
    the grave as nothing other than a soft couch of ease or rest. As verily,
    before God, it truly is just this; for he testifies, John 11:11; Lazarus,
    our friend sleeps; Matthew 9:24: The maiden is not dead, she sleeps. Thus,
    too, St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, removes from sight all hateful aspects of
    death as related to our mortal body and brings forward nothing but charming
    and joyful aspects of the promised life. He says there [vv. 42ff]: It is
    sown in corruption and will rise in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor
    (that is, a hateful, shameful form) and will rise in glory; it is sown in
    weakness and will rise in strength; it is sown in natural body and will rise
    a spiritual body.—&quot;Christian Song Latin and German, for Use at
    Funerals,&quot; 1542, in <i>Works of Luther</i> (1932), vol. 6,&nbsp; pp.
    287, 288.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus after death the soul goes to its bedchamber and to its
    peace, and while it is sleeping it does not realize its sleep, and God
    preserves indeed the awakening soul. God is able to awake Elijah, Moses, and
    others, and so control them, so that they will live. But how can that be?
    That we do not know; we satisfy ourselves with the example of bodily sleep,
    and with what God says: it is a sleep, a rest, and a peace. He who sleeps
    naturally knows nothing of that which happens in his neighbor's house; and</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; </font><font size="3">Here is another sample:</font></p>
  <font size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We should learn to view our death in the right light, so
    that we need not become alarmed on account of it, as unbelief does; because
    in Christ it is indeed not death, but a fine, sweet and brief sleep, which
    brings us release from this vale of tears, from sin and from the fear and
    extremity of real death and from all the misfortunes of this life, and we
    shall be secure and without care, rest sweetly and gently for a brief
    moment, as on a sofa, until the time when he shall call and awaken us
    together with all his dear children to his eternal glory and joy. For since
    we call it a sleep, we know that we shall not remain in it, but be again
    awakened and live, and that the time during which we sleep, shall seem no
    longer than if we had just fallen asleep. Hence, we shall censure ourselves
    that we were surprised or alarmed at such a sleep in the hour of death, and
    suddenly come alive out of the grave and from decomposition, and entirely
    well, fresh, with a pure, clear, glorified life, meet our Lord and Savior
    Jesus Christ in the clouds . . .<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Scripture everywhere affords such consolation, which speaks of
    the death of the saints, as if they fell asleep and were gathered to their
    fathers, that is, had overcome death through this faith and comfort in
    Christ, and awaited the resurrection, together with the saints who preceded
    them in death.—<i>A Compend of Luther's Theology</i>, edited by Hugh
    Thomson Ker, Jr., p. 242.</p>

  <p><font size="3">WILLIAM TYNDALE (1484-1536), English Bible translator and
  martyr</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In Britain William Tyndale, translator of the
  Bible into English, came to the defense of the revived</font></p>
  <font size="2">
  <hr align="left" width="20%">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; *In his Master of Arts thesis (1946), &quot;A Study of Martin
  Luther's Teaching Concerning the State of the Dead,&quot; T. N. Ketola,
  tabulating Luther's references to death as a sleep—as found in Luther's <i>Sammtliche
  Schriften</i>, Walsh's Concordia, 1904 ed.—lists 125 specific Luther
  references to death as a sleep. Ketola cites another smaller group of
  references showing Luther believed in the periodic consciousness of some. But
  the main point is that, while the dead live, they are unconscious—which is
  stated some seven times.</p>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[pg. 574]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">teaching of conditional immortality.
  This, as well as other teachings, brought him into direct conflict with the
  papal champion, Sir Thomas More, likewise of England. In 1529 More had
  strongly objected to the &quot;pestilential sect&quot; represented by Tyndale
  and Luther, because they held that &quot;all souls lie and sleep till
  doomsday.&quot; In 1530 Tyndale responded vigorously, declaring:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye, in putting them [the departed souls]
    in heaven, hell, and purgatory, destroy the arguments wherewith Christ and
    Paul prove the resurrection.... And again, if the souls be in heaven, tell
    me why they be not in as good case as the angels be? And then what cause is
    there of the resurrection?—William Tyndale, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EMcOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=#PPP7,M1"> <i>An Answer to Sir Thomas
    More's Dialogue</i> (Parker's 1850 reprint)</a>, bk. 4, ch. 4, pp. 180, 181.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyndale went to the
  heart of the issue in pointing out the papacy's draft upon the teachings of
  &quot;heathen philosophers&quot; in seeking to establish its contention of
  innate immortality.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Thus:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The true faith putteth
    [setteth forth] the resurrection, which we be warned to look for every hour.
    The heathen philosophers, denying that, did put [set forth] that the souls
    did ever live. And the pope joineth the spiritual doctrine of Christ and the
    fleshly doctrine of philosophers together; things so contrary that they
    cannot agree, no more than the Spirit and the flesh do in a Christian man.
    And because the fleshly-minded pope consenteth unto heathen doctrine,
    therefore he corrupteth the Scripture to stablish it.</font><font size="2">—</font><font
    face="Times New Roman" size="2">lbid., p. 180.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp; In yet another section
  of the same treatise, dealing with the &quot;invocation of saints,&quot;
  Tyndale uses the same reasoning, pointing out that the doctrine of departed
  saints being in heaven had not yet been introduced in Christ's day:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">[pg. 575]</font></p>
  <font size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And when he [More] proveth that the saints be in heaven in
    glory with Christ already, saying, &quot;If God be their God, they be in
    heaven, for he is not the God of the dead;&quot; there he stealeth away
    Christ's argument, wherewith he proveth the resurrection: that Abraham and
    all saints should rise again, and not that their souls were in heaven; which
    doctrine was not yet in the world. And with that doctrine he taketh away the
    resurrection quite, and maketh Christ's argument of none effect.—Ibid., p.
    118.</p>
  </blockquote>
  </font>
  <p><font size="3">Tyndale presses his contention still further by showing the
  conflict of papal teaching with St. Paul, as he says in slightly sarcastic
  vein:</font></p>
  <font size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Nay, Paul, thou art unlearned; go to Master More, and
    learn a new way. We be not most miserable, though we rise not again; for our
    souls go to heaven as soon as we be dead, and are there in as great joy as
    Christ that is risen again.&quot; And I marvel that Paul had not comforted
    the Thessalonians with that doctrine, if he had wist [known] it, that the
    souls of their dead had been in joy; as he did with the resurrection, that
    their dead should rise again. If the souls be in heaven, in as great glory
    as the angels, after your doctrine, shew me what cause should be of the
    resurrection)—Ibid.</p>
