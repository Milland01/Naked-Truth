      <p align="center"> <u><font size="5">Pontifex Maximus</font></u></p>
      <p>As shown above, in the Latin Vulgate (the official Bible of the 
      Catholic Church), the word used in Hebrews for both the high 
      priest of the Levitical priesthood, and the high priesthood of our Lord 
      Jesus Christ, is either pontifex or pontificem. In contrast, the Pope of 
      the Roman Catholic Church is officially titled <u>Pontifex Maximus</u>, which 
      then obviously means the &quot;highest high priest&quot;, placing the pope
      <i>above</i> the high priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ. That is 
      blasphemy and Antichrist!</p>
      <p><u><b>Jacob's Ladder</b></u></p>
      <blockquote>
  <p>Gen 28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.<br>
  Gen 28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, 
  because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them 
  for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.<br>
  Gen 28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top 
  of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending 
  on it.<br>
  Gen 28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of 
  Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee 
  will I give it, and to thy seed;<br>
  Gen 28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt 
  spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the 
  south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be 
  blessed.<br>
  Gen 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places 
  whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not 
  leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.<br>
  Gen 28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is 
  in this place; and I knew it not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the Lord God of Israel was at the top of this ladder that 
  extended down to Earth (v. 13). The Gospel of John explains Jacob's ladder:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>John 1:51 And he saith unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Verily, verily, I 
  say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God 
  ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
      <p>Jacob's ladder was symbolic of Jesus, the incarnate Son of God, fully 
      man and fully God. Jesus is the top of the ladder in heaven because He is 
      fully God, and He is the bottom of the ladder on Earth because He took on 
      human flesh, He is fully man. Jesus is therefore the true living &quot;bridge&quot; 
      between mankind and God.</p>
      <p>The apparent literal meaning of the pagan title Pontifex Maximus is 
      Maximum Bridge Builder, denoting the Roman Caesar was the highest priest, 
      the supreme bridge between the gods and man, because the Caesars also 
      claimed to be a god on Earth. Emperor <font color="#000000">Gratian</font> 
      declined the title of Pontifex Maximus in 381 A.D., and it was gradually 
      adopted by the Bishop of Rome, who claims to take the place of God on 
      Earth (<font face="Times New Roman">Pope Leo XIII, <font size="3">
      Apostolic Exhortation</font><b>
      <a style="font-style: italic" href="l13-pgp.html">
      Praeclara Gratulationis Publicae</a> </b>(The Reunion of Christendom), 
      dated June 20, 1894, trans. in <em>The Great Encyclical Letters of Pope 
      Leo XIII</em> (New York: Benziger, 1903), paragraph 5, page 304).</font></p>

  <font face="Times New Roman">
  <img src="tiberius.jpg" alt="Tiberius - Pontif Maxim" hspace="10" width="408" height="204"></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Above you see a Denarius or &quot;Tribute Penny&quot; minted at Lugdunum 
  (Lyon) during the reign of Emperor Tiberius (14-37 A.D.) The obverse with 
  Tiberius' bust is inscribed TI CAESAR DIVI AVG F AVGVSTVS. The reverse is 
  inscribed PONTIF MAXIM and depicts the emperor's mother Livia as Pax (peace) 
  holding an olive-branch and long vertical scepter. This is the type of coin 
  mentioned in Matt 22:19, Mark 12:15, and Luke 20:24. If someone had asked the 
  apostle Peter who the &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; was, he would likely have shown them 
  a tribute penny like that above and replied &quot;The Roman Emperor&quot;. Peter would 
  not have known of any other application of the title.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Now below is a very similar papal medal proclaiming Pope John 
  XXIII, the claimed successor to Peter, to be the reigning &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; 
  on the front (appropriately wearing the triregno crown) and &quot;Obedience and 
  Peace&quot; on the reverse.</font></p>

    </center>
  </div>
      <p>It is also worth noting that Catholics also call the pope &quot;Holy Father&quot;, 
      when there is only one use of that phrase in all of scripture, in 
      reference to God the Father:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>John 17:11 <font color="#FF0000">And now I am no more in the world, but 
      these are in the world, and I come to thee. <u>Holy Father</u>, keep 
      through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be 
      one, as we are.</font></p>
      <p>Mat 23:9<font color="#FF0000"> And call no man your father upon the 
      earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</font></p>
