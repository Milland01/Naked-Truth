  <p align="left">The following quotations, from various Catholic sources, will 
  establish fairly well the unbiblical teaching of the Catholic Church which 
  claims Mary to be the distributor or mediatrix of all of God's grace.</p>
  <p align="left">Speaking to those gathered at Castel Gandolfo on August 15, 
  2010, the Catholic feast of the Assumption of Mary, Pope Benedict XVI prior to 
  the Angelus said:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="left">... the All Holy is invoked as Heavenly Mother, who holds the 
  Son of God in her arms and under whose protection the whole of humanity finds 
  refuge, with the very ancient prayer, &quot;We shelter under your protection, Holy 
  Mother of God: despise not our petitions in our needs, but deliver us from 
  every danger, O glorious and Blessed Virgin&quot;.<br>

    <p>4. ... Great indeed is Our trust in Mary. The resplendent glory of her 
    merits, far exceeding all the choirs of angels, elevates her to the very 
    steps of the throne of God.[1] Her foot has crushed the head of Satan. Set 
    up between Christ and His Church,[2] Mary, ever lovable and full of grace, 
    always has delivered the Christian people from their greatest calamities and 
    from the snares and assaults of all their enemies, ever rescuing them from 
    ruin. </p>
    <p>5. And likewise in our own day, Mary, with the ever merciful affection so 
    characteristic of her maternal heart, wishes, through her efficacious 
    intercession with God, to deliver her children from the sad and grief-laden 
    troubles, from the tribulations, the anxiety, the difficulties, and the 
    punishments of God's anger which afflict the world because of the sins of 
    men. Wishing to restrain and to dispel the violent hurricane of evils which, 
    as We lament from the bottom of Our heart, are everywhere afflicting the 
    Church, Mary desires to transform Our sadness into joy. The foundation of 
    all Our confidence, as you know well, Venerable Brethren, is found in the 
    Blessed Virgin Mary. For, God has committed to Mary the treasury of all good 
    things, in order that everyone may know that through her are obtained every 
    hope, every grace, and all salvation. For this is His will, that we obtain 
    everything through Mary.[3]</p>

    <p>9. When we have recourse to Mary in prayer, we are having recourse to the 
    Mother of mercy, who is so well disposed toward us that, whatever the 
    necessity that presses upon us especially in attaining eternal life, she is 
    instantly at our side of her own accord, even though she has not been 
    invoked. She dispenses grace with a generous hand from that treasure with 
    which from the beginning she was divinely endowed in fullest abundance that 
    she might be worthy to be the Mother of God. By the fullness of grace which 
    confers on her the most illustrious of her many titles, the Blessed Virgin 
    is infinitely superior to all the hierarchies of men and angels, the one 
    creature who is closest of all to Christ. &quot;It is a great thing in any saint 
    to have grace sufficient for the salvation of many souls; but to have enough 
    to suffice for the salvation of everybody in the world is the greatest of 
    all; and this is found in Christ and in the Blessed Virgin.&quot;[1]</p>

    <p>5. If in all this series of Mysteries, Venerable Brethren, are developed 
    the counsels of God in regard to us -- &quot;counsels of wisdom and of 
    tenderness&quot; (St. Bernard) -- not less apparent is the greatness of the 
    benefits for which we are debtors to the Virgin Mother. No man can meditate 
    upon these without feeling a new awakening in his heart of confidence that 
    he will certainly obtain through Mary the fullness of the mercies of God. 
    And to this end vocal prayer chimes well with the Mysteries. First, as is 
    meet and right, comes the Lord's Prayer, addressed to Our Father in Heaven: 
    and having, with the elect petitions dictated by Our Divine Master, called 
    upon the Father, from the throne of His Majesty we turn our prayerful voices 
    to Mary. Thus is confirmed that law of merciful meditation of which We have 
    spoken, and which St. Bernardine of Siena thus expresses: &quot;Every grace 
    granted to man has three degrees in order; for by God it is communicated to 
    Christ, from Christ it passes to the Virgin, and from the Virgin it descends 
    to us.&quot;</p>

    <p>7. It is impossible to measure the power and scope of her offices since 
    the day she was taken up to that height of heavenly glory in the company of 
    her Son, to which the dignity and luster of her merits entitle her. From her 
    heavenly abode she began, by God's decree, to watch over the Church, to 
    assist and befriend us as our Mother; so that she who was so intimately 
    associated with the mystery of human salvation is just as closely associated 
    with the distribution of the graces which for all time will flow from the 
    Redemption.</p>
    <p>8. The power thus put into her hands is all but unlimited. How unerringly 
    right, then, are Christian souls when they turn to Mary for help as though 
    impelled by an instinct of nature, confidently sharing with her their future 
    hopes and past achievements, their sorrows and joys, commending themselves 
    like children to the care of a bountiful mother. How rightly, too, has every 
    nation and every liturgy without exception acclaimed her great renown, which 
    has grown greater with the voice of each succeeding century. Among her many 
    other titles we find her hailed as &quot;our Lady, our Mediatrix,&quot;[3] &quot;the 
    Reparatrix of the whole world,&quot;[4] &quot;the Dispenser of all heavenly gifts.&quot;[5]</p>
    <p>9. Since faith is the foundation, the source, of the gifts of God by 
    which man is raised above the order of nature and is endowed with the 
    dispositions requisite for life eternal, we are in justice bound to 
    recognize the hidden influence of Mary in obtaining the gift of faith and 
    its salutary cultivation - of Mary who brought the &quot;author of faith&quot;[6] into 
    this world and who, because of her own great faith, was called &quot;blessed.&quot; &quot;O 
    Virgin most holy, none abounds in the knowledge of God except through thee; 
    none, O Mother of God, attains salvation except through thee; none receives 
    a gift from the throne of mercy except through thee.&quot;[7]</p>

    Mary she merited to become most worthily the Reparatrix of the lost world (Eadmeri 
    Mon. De Excellentia Virg. Mariae, c. 9) and Dispensatrix of all the gifts 
    that Our Savior purchased for us by His Death and by His Blood.</p>

    already mentioned between the Mother and the Son, it has been allowed to the 
    august Virgin to be the most powerful mediatrix and advocate of the whole 
    world with her Divine Son (Pius IX. Ineffabilis). ...</p>
    <p>14. We are then, it will be seen, very far from attributing to the Mother 
    of God a productive power of grace--a power which belongs to God alone. Yet, 
    since Mary carries it over all in holiness and union with Jesus Christ, and 
    has been associated by Jesus Christ in the work of redemption, she merits 
    for us &quot;de congruo,&quot; in the language of theologians, what Jesus Christ

    IX. in Bull Ineffabilis).</p>

    of it, who seduced by the wiles of the demon or deceived by false doctrines 
    think they can do without the help of the Virgin. Hapless are they who 
    neglect Mary under pretext of the honor to be paid to Jesus Christ! ...</p>

  <p>Imagine that. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that Mary distributes the 
  graces of God and dispenses all the gifts of salvation that Jesus has won for 
  us. In a nutshell, they say salvation is gained through Mary and this is why 
  she is called Mediatrix. And then, because of her sacrifice and suffering, she 
  also helped redeem the fallen human race. It is no wonder that the Catholics 
  pray to her, they believe her to be the agent of salvation between God and 
  man. She will listen, when God is cold and indifferent to our plight? Note the 
  following from St. Alphonsus Liguori, a respected doctor of the church:</p>
  <hr width="50%">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><u><big><b>The Glories of Mary</b></big></u></p>
    <p align="left">CHAPTER I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAIL HOLY QUEEN</p>
    <p>[pg. 6 /18] How great, then, should be our confidence in this Queen, 
    knowing her great power with God, and that she is so rich and full of mercy, 
    that there is no one living on the earth who does not partake in her 
    compassion and favor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Blessed Lady herself revealed this to St. Bridget, 
    saying: &quot;I am the Queen of heaven and the Mother of Mercy; I am the joy of 
    the just and the door through which sinners are brought to God. There is no 
    sinner on earth so accursed as to be deprived of my mercy. ...</p>
    <p>CHAPTER II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OUR LIFE, OUR SWEETNESS</p>
    <p>[pg. 26 /63] Truly are those souls to be pitied who abandon this defense, 
    in ceasing their devotion to Mary, and no longer [pg. 27] recommending 
    themselves to her in times of danger. If the sun ceased to rise, says St. 
    Bernard, how could the world become other than a chaos of darkness and 
    horror?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying this question to Mary, he repeats it, &quot;Take away the 
    sun and [pg. /64] where will be the day? Take away Mary, and what will be 
    left but the darkest night?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a soul loses devotion to Mary, it is immediately 
    enveloped in darkness, and it is in that darkness of which the Holy Spirit 
    speaks in the Psalms: &quot;You bring darkness and it is night; then all the 
    beasts of the forest roam about.&quot; (104:20) ...</p>
    <p>CHAPTER IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO THEE DO WE CRY</p>
    <p>[pg. 48 /112] St. Anselm reminds us that we may obtain mercy more quickly 
    from Mary than from Jesus, because Jesus is also a judge who can punish, 
    while Mary exercises mercy as a patroness. It is not as if Mary were more 
    powerful than Jesus, for we know that Jesus Christ is our only Savior, and 
    that He alone by His merits has obtained and obtains salvation for us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He reminds us: &quot;We often obtain more promptly what we ask by 
    invoking Mary than by invoking Jesus. Her Son is lord and judge of all, and 
    discerns the merits of each one; therefore, if He does not immediately grant 
    the prayers of all, He is just. When however, the Mother's name is invoked,&nbsp; 
    [pg. /113] though the merits of the suppliant are not such as to deserve 
    that his favor be granted, those of the Mother supply, that he may receive.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things are asked from God and are not granted; they are 
    asked from Mary and are obtained. Now why is this? Because God has thus 
    decreed to honor His Mother. ...</p>
    <p>CHAPTER V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TO THEE DO WE SIGH</p>
    <p>[pg. 56 /128] There can be no doubt that by the merits of Jesus, Mary was 
    made the mediatrix of our salvation - not, indeed, a mediatrix of justice, 
    but of favor and intercession. St Bonaventure expressly calls her: &quot;Mary, 
    the most faithful mediatrix of our salvation.&quot; St. Lawrence Justinian asks: 
    &quot;How can she be otherwise than full of grace, who has been made the ladder 
    to paradise, the gate of heaven, the most true mediatrix between God and 
    man?&quot; ... [pg. 57 /129] ... That it is most useful and holy to have recourse 
    to the intercession of Mary can only be doubted by those who have not faith. 
    But, what we intend to prove here, is that the intercession of Mary is even 
    necessary to salvation. We say necessary - not absolutely but morally.</p>
    <p>[pg.&nbsp; /136]<span class="gstxt_hlt">&nbsp; Again, </span>the holy 
    church calls her 'the happy <span class="gstxt_hlt">gate </span>of
    <span class="gstxt_hlt">heaven;</span>' for as the same Saint Bernard 
    remarks: 'As every mandate of grace that is sent by a king passes by the
    <span class="gstxt_hlt">palace-gates, </span>so does every grace that comes 
    from <span class="gstxt_hlt">heaven </span>to the world pass through the 
    hands of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Mary.' </span>Saint Bonaventure says that
    <span class="gstxt_hlt">Mary </span>is called 'the <span class="gstxt_hlt">
    gate </span>of <span class="gstxt_hlt">heaven, </span>because no one can 
    enter that blessed kingdom without passing by her.'</p>
    <p>[pg. 61 /143] St. John Damascene did not scruple to cry out: &quot;Pure and 
    immaculate Virgin, save me, and deliver me from eternal damnation!&quot; St. 
    Bonaventure called Mary &quot;the salvation of those who invoked her.&quot; And St. 
    Germanus had written previously: &quot;No one is saved but through Mary.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Cajetan used to say that [pg. /144] we may seek for 
    graces but shall never find them without the intercession of Mary. St. 
    Antonius expresses it this way: &quot;Whoever asks and expects to obtain graces 
    without the intercession of Mary endeavors to fly without wings.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blessed Raymond Jordan repeats the same thing: &quot;Our salvation 
    is in her hands.&quot; Cassian is even stronger, saying: &quot;The salvation of all 
    depends on their being favored and protected by Mary.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [pg. 62 /145] And as we have access to the Eternal Father, 
    says St. Bernard, only through Jesus Christ, so have we access to Jesus 
    Christ only through Mary: &quot;By you we have access to the Son, O blessed 
    finder of grace, bearer of life, and mother of salvation, that we may 
    receive Him from you, who through you was given to us.&quot; ...</p>
    <p>CHAPTER VII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, GRACIOUS ADVOCATE</p>
    <p><span class="gtxt_body" id="para.188.1.0.box.175.161.666.994.q.60">[ pg. 
    /169] '<span class="gstxt_hlt">On this account it was,' says </span>Saint
    <span class="gstxt_hlt">Bernard, </span>'<span class="gstxt_hlt">that the 
    Eternal Father, </span>wishing to show all the mercy possible, besides 
    giving us Jesus Christ, our principal Advocate with Him, was pleased also to 
    give us Mary, as our Advocate with Jesus Christ.' 'There is no doubt,' the 
    Saint adds, 'that Jesus Christ is the only mediator of justice between men 
    and God; that, in virtue of His own merits and promises, He will and can 
    obtain us pardon and the Divine favours; but because men acknowledge and 
    fear the Divine Majesty, which is in Him as God, for this reason it was 
    necessary to assign us another Advo [pg. /170] c</span>ate, to whom we might 
    have recourse with less few and more confidence, and this Advocate is Mary, 
    than whom we cannot find one more powerful with His Divine Majesty, or one 
    more merciful towards ourselves.' The Saint <span class="gstxt_hlt">says,
    </span>'Christ is a faithful and powerful Mediator between God and men, but 
    in Him men fear the majesty of God. A mediator, then, was needed with the 
    Mediator Himself; nor could a more fitting one be found than Mary.'<sup><span class="gstxt_sup">23</span></sup> 
    'But,' continues the same Saint, ' should any one fear to go to the feet of 
    this most sweet Advocate, who has nothing in her of severity, nothing 
    terrible, but who is all courteous, amiable, and benign, lie would indeed be 
    offering an insult to the tender compassion of Mary.'<sup><span class="gstxt_sup">24</span></sup> 
    And he adds, 'Read, and read again, as often as you please, all that is said 
    of her in the Gospels, and if you can find any the least trait of severity 
    recorded of her, then fear to approach her. But no, this you can never find; 
    and therefore go to her with a joyful heart, and she will save you by her 
    intercession.'<sup><span class="gstxt_sup">25</span></sup></p>

    <p>And if, on account of the moral necessity of Mary's intercession for all, 
    every Christian ought to be devoted to the Mother of God, how much more 
    should priests, who are bound by greater obligations, and stand in need of 
    greater graces for salvation, practise devotion in her honor! We priests 
    should remain always at the feet of Mary, asking the aid of her prayers. St. 
    Francis Borgia had great doubts about the salvation of those that have not a 
    special devotion to Mary; because, according to St. Antonine, he who expects 
    graces from God without the intercession of Mary attempts to fly without 
    wings. St. Anselm has gone so far as to say: &quot;It is impossible to be saved 
    if we turn away from thee, O Mary.&quot; St. Bonaventure has said the same: &quot;He 
    that neglects her will die in his sins.&quot; Blessed Albertus Magnus says: 'The 
    people that do not serve thee will perish.&quot; And speaking of Mary, Richard of 
    St. Laurence says: &quot;All those whom this ship does not receive are lost in 
    the sea [pg. 414] of this world.&quot; But, on the other hand, he who is faithful 
    in the service of Mary will be certainly saved. &quot;Oh Mother of God,&quot; says St. 
    John Damascene, &quot;if I put my confidence in you I shall be saved. If I am 
    under your protection I have nothing to fear; for to be devoted to you is to 
    have certain arms of salvation which God gives only to those whose salvation 
    he wills in a special manner.&quot;</p>

    <p>6. How is Mary our intercessor?</p>
    <p>Mary is our intercessor because in heaven she continues to intercede with 
    her Son, Jesus, for us in the world.</p>
    <p>She is our intercessor because of the following reasons: (1) As worthy 
    Mother of God and full of grace, she occupies a middle position between God 
    and his creatures. (2) Together with Christ and under him, she cooperated in 
    the reconciliation of God and mankind while she was still on earth. (3) Now 
    from heaven she distributes the graces that God bestows on his children.</p>
    <p>Of course, this intercession is always secondary and subject to Christ's 
    primary and self-sufficient intercessory role. All favors granted by God to 
    his rational creatures are granted in virtue of and because of Mary's 
    intercession. It is not necessary that we explicitly implore her 
    intercessions in our prayers. But whether we mention her or not, it is 
    through her that we receive whatever we receive.</p>

    through her hands; and (according to the power she has received over them), 
    as St. Bernadine teaches, Mary gives to whom she wills, the way she wills,

    and for the glory of God, which must be their final end. In everything we do 
    we must renounce our self-love, because very often self-love sets itself up 
    in an imperceptible manner as the end of our actions. We should often 
    repeat, from the bottom of our heart: &lt;&lt;O my dear Mother! It is for thee

  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you 
    into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
    Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would 
    pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
    Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto 
    you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
    Gal 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other 
    gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>

  trouble.<br>
  Psa 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.<br>

  <p class="OmniPage258" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">There are two kinds of 
  mediation. The first is that one receives something from another, but with 
  some purpose in mind; then the one who has received the gift is not the owner, 
  but must use the gift in such a way as has been told to him; meanwhile another 
  received the same gift but for his exclusive property and has the right to 
  administer it as he chooses.</p>
  <p class="OmniPage259" style="text-indent: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The 
  Blessed Mother is in the second category, having received graces in that 
  manner from the Godhead. She is not like a mailcarrier. She does not receive 
  graces from God for an appointed purpose so that She might use them in one way 
  or another. The Immaculate Virgin receives graces from God for Her own 
  exclusive property and She dispenses them to us how She wills, to whom She 
  wills, and inasmuch as She wills, for these are Her own. Here, finally, do we 
  see how holy and great God made His Blessed Mother, and how much we should 
  honor Her.�</p>

	<p align="left">There is a word that aptly describes all of the above Catholic 
  teaching - AntiChrist. Mary has been completely substituted for Jesus as the 
  mediator with mankind, a concept that is utterly unbiblical, and worthy only 
  of the apostate harlot church, Mystery Babylon.</p>

  Rom 1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit 
  of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:<br>
  Rom 1:5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the 
  faith among all nations, for his name:<br>
  Rom 1:6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:<br>
  Rom 1:7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to 
  you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p>Rom 3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, 
  being witnessed by the law and the prophets;<br>
  Rom 3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto 
  all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br>
  Rom 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
  Rom 3:24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in 
  Christ Jesus:<br>
  Rom 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his 
  blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, 
  through the forbearance of God;<br>
  Rom 3:26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be 
  just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
  <p>Rom 5:1 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through 
  our Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
  Rom 5:2 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, 
  and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>
  <p>Rom 5:17 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they 
  which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign

  <p>The Bible clearly teaches that grace and mercy for the sinner come from God 
  the Father, through Jesus Christ, <u>the one mediator of God's grace and 
  mercy.</u></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, 
        the man Christ Jesus;<br>
        1 Tim 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due 
        time.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed 
    into the heavens, <b>Jesus the Son of God</b>, let us hold fast our profession.<br>
    Heb 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the 
    feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, 
    yet without sin.<br>
    Heb 4:16 <b>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we 
    may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 9:14 How much more shall the blood of <b>Christ</b>, who through the eternal 
    Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead 
    works to serve the living God?<br>
    Heb 9:15 And for this cause <b>he is the mediator of the new testament</b>, that by 
    means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the 
    first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal 
    inheritance.</p>
    <p>Heb 12:24 And to <b>Jesus the mediator of the new covenant</b>, and to the blood 
    of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Who does the Bible say we are to approach for forgiveness under the New 
    Covenant? 
    Jesus, the one mediator of God's grace and mercy!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that 
    by the name of <em><b>Jesus Christ of Nazareth</b></em>, whom ye crucified, 
    whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before 
    you whole.<br>
    Acts 4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which 
    is become the head of the corner.<br>
    Acts 4:12 <em><b>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none 
    other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</b></em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The death of Jesus on the cross is the only sacrifice that redeemed man. To 
  advocate otherwise is Antichrist. Catholics pray to Mary because they look to 
  <u>her</u> for grace and mercy, not Jesus alone, and that IS official Catholic teaching, whether most 
  Catholics know it or not. Salvation will not be found in prayers to Mary (who 
  is quite dead anyway). It can only be found in faith in the death and 
  resurrection of Jesus Christ in your place, to wipe away the stain of sin in 
  your life. Nothing Mary did assisted in paying that price at all. Prayers to 
  Mary or saints are completely futile. Pray to God ONLY, and then He will hear 
  you.</p>
