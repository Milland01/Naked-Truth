	  who but the Antichrist would dare to commit the ultimate act of blasphemy 
	  by enthroning himself between 
	  two golden Cherubim, dressed in white linen &mdash; as if he were God 
	  Almighty majestically cloaked in awesome fiery righteousness, the gleaming 
	  white robe of light of His Shekinah Glory, on the mercy seat of the Ark of 
	  the Covenant in the most holy place of the Temple, or on a Great White 
	  Throne of power and authority for judgment?<blockquote>
        <p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: medium;">Isa 37:16 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that
dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of
all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.</p>

<blockquote>
	<strong>2 Thess 2:3-8 (KJV)</strong>
<blockquote>
<strong>3</strong> 
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day [the second coming] shall not 
come, except there come a falling away [apostasy] first, and that man of sin 
[lawlessness] be revealed, the son of perdition [destruction]; </blockquote>

	The phrase &quot;son of perdition&quot; is used only twice in scripture, here by Paul, 
	and also in John 17:12, where Jesus is referring to Judas Iscariot, a type 
	or pattern of the antichrist. Like Judas, the antichrist is a deceiver, a 
	wolf in sheep's clothing who outwardly professes to be a loyal, faithful and 
	obedient servant of God, even as he subtly and masterfully deceives most 
	Christians into <a href="lawlessness.html">rebellion against God and His law</a>: </blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<strong>4</strong> Who 
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is 
worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that 
he is God. 
</blockquote>

While the Bible teaches that the remnant church will call the faithful 
	saints out of apostate Babylon by proclaiming the three angels' messages 
	(Rev. 14:6-11), the papacy is attempting the exact opposite, to unite all 
	Christians under the papacy in an ecumenical movement. <br><blockquote>
<strong>5</strong> Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
		<br></blockquote>
	When Paul was in Thessalonica, he had spoken freely with them, but he could 
	not be so candid in his letter. 

<blockquote>
	<strong>6</strong> And 
now ye know what withholdeth that he [Antichrist] might be revealed in his time. 

	<br> 

	<strong>7</strong> For 
the mystery of iniquity [Antichrist] doth already work: only he who now letteth 
	[restrains] will let [restrain], 
until he be taken out of the way.<br><strong>8</strong> And then 
shall that Wicked be revealed, ...</blockquote>
	Paul had told them exactly who the <a href="fathers-on-antichrist.html">
	restrainer of the Antichrist</a> was, and when this restrainer was removed,
	<a href="times.html">the &quot;time&quot; period in which the Antichrist would flourish</a> 
	and thereby reveal himself.<br>
	<blockquote>
		<strong>8</strong> ... whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of 
his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:<br></blockquote>
Note that 
	in verse 7, Paul says the Antichrist is already present, but inhibited, 
	awaiting the opportunity to work freely. This same Antichrist would be 
	present at the second coming, destroyed by the Lord's glory. Clearly 
	Antichrist was not a single individual, it was a dynasty of men that would 
	span the <a href="1260years.html">1260 years of supremacy</a>, and beyond, to 
	the second coming.
