  <p>Note that Benny Hinn claimed that God revealed the above prophecies to him. 
  Now either God has erred, or Benny Hinn invented these prophecies and he never 
  heard from God. The truth should be obvious - Benny Hinn does not hear from 
  God, he is without doubt a false prophet.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my 
    name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto 
    them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of 
    nought, and the deceit of their heart.</p>
    <p>Ezek 13:2 [NIV] &quot;Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who 
    are now prophesying. Say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination: 
    'Hear the word of the LORD!<br>
    Ezek 13:3 This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the foolish prophets 
    who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!<br>
    Ezek 13:4 Your prophets, O Israel, are like jackals among ruins.<br>
    Ezek 13:5 You have not gone up to the breaks in the wall to repair it for 
    the house of Israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of 
    the LORD.<br>
    Ezek 13:6 Their visions are false and their divinations a lie. They say, 
    &quot;The LORD declares,&quot; when the LORD has not sent them; yet they expect their 
    words to be fulfilled.<br>
    Ezek 13:7 Have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when 
    you say, &quot;The LORD declares,&quot; though I have not spoken?<br>
    Ezek 13:8 &quot;'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because of your 
    false words and lying visions, I am against you, declares the Sovereign 
    LORD.<br>
    Ezek 13:9 My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and 
    utter lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of my people or 
    be listed in the records of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the 
    land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">Now with that kind of record for Benny Hinn, Trinity 
  Broadcasting Network began its Spring 2000 fundraising Praise-A-Thon with some 
  rather astounding claims. On the April 2nd TBN program, Benny Hinn claimed 
  that God is about to make a major move to anoint the people of God, as soon as 
  Israel signs a treaty with the ailing Hafez Al-Assad<a href="#*">*</a> of 
  Syria, which will likely be within the next year. This will signal the 
  impending large scale shift of financial wealth from the wicked to those 
  obedient to God. But, in order to benefit from this unprecedented supernatural 
  anointing, you must be obedient to God and sow your financial seed (to TBN) 
  now!</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">However, its <i>not</i> the money that really concerns God, 
  its your <i>total</i> obedience. The greatest danger that Christians face now, 
  according to Hinn, is disobedience against God by <i>not</i> contributing 
  financially to the coming harvest of God with your seed money! You must be 
  willing to give your <i>all</i>, in order to demonstrate your true obedience. 
  In fact, Benny revealed that God is even now healing those who call in their 
  contributions to TBN. But this is <i>not</i> selling healing for money, he 
  says, it is God blessing those who are truly obedient and worthy to receive 
  his coming unusual anointing! Indeed, God will even be <i>saving</i> people 
  you know as you are calling in your pledge to TBN. Great signs and wonders are 
  anticipated this coming year, and Benny even told Paul Crouch to expect that 
  there will be dead people raised this year! (<a href="http://www.schambach.org/">R. 
  W. Schambach</a> claimed to have raised a dead man on another later TBN 
  program, in addition to healing the blind, deaf, mute, and lame.) The 
  implication is that you will be bypassed by God and miss out on the 
  supernatural anointing to come if you are not totally obedient to God and call 
  in your pledge to TBN <i>now</i>!</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p><font size="3"><a name="*">*</a> The death of Assad on June 10th 2000 shows that 
  Benny Hinn did <i>not</i> know what he was talking about, and is further proof 
  that he is a false prophet, if any more evidence was needed.</font></p>

      <p>&quot;Ladies and gentleman, <i>Jesus is shaking the world!</i> Now something 
      else is happening that is to me <i>awesome! Absolutely awesome! </i>The 
      Lord is <i>physically</i> appearing in the Muslim world. I'm telling you, 
      Paul, I am hearing it now more and more and more. Since we preachers 
      cannot go there, Jesus is - just going there Himself. Since we preachers 
      are not <i>permitted</i> to go in, He is just showing up - Himself. You 
      know the Scriptures says clearly that the Lord <i>did</i> appear, did He 
      not? Ah for forty days, isn't that right? And the, and the, and the 
      Scriptures says he, he, he even, he even appeared to Paul. Now we are 
      always thinking, well Jesus can't really preach, preach the Gospel. Who 
      told you that? He was the first one <i>to</i> preach the Gospel. In fact 
      He is the one who came to Paul and said, <i>Paul, I am Jesus</i>. He, He 
      didn't send no angel to do that job. He did it Himself. If Jesus revealed 
      Himself to Paul, why not reveal Himself to a lot more than just Paul? <i>
      And He is doing it! </i>The reason the Lord had to appear to Paul is 
      because He knew Paul wouldn't listen to nobody else. Now in the case of 
      Cornelius, the angel said send for Peter, 'cause, because Cornelius was, 
      was ready, his heart was right, he'd been in prayer. But here's Paul 
      killing everybody, causing 'em to blaspheme, Jesus said this man won't 
      even listen to an angel, so I'll go do the job myself. So He went and 
      knocked him right off his horse and preached the Gospel to him. He's doing 
      the same thing today in the Muslim world. He's appearing, <i>hear this</i>, 
      He is appearing to <i>Muslims,</i> saying I am Jesus of Nazareth! And 
      they're coming to know the Lord! Why are those things happening? It's the 
      last days! Saints, this is why we need to give to the Gospel <i>now</i> 
      more than ever. You know naively say well I gave last year. Forget it! 
      Last year it's gone! That cycle is over with! Seed time - harvest of last 
      year is gone. Every season is a fresh season. We are in a <i>fresh</i> 
      season. What, what you gave last year will not reap you anything this 
      year. What you gave even a few months ago is <i>gone</i>, you <i>got</i> 
      the harvest for that.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;The hour is <i>urgent</i>. Many of you have known me for many years. 
      But I am telling you right now, things I haven't said years 'n years 'n 
      years ago. I believe - <i>here this, hear this!</i> I believe, that Jesus, 
      God's Son, is about to appear <i>physically</i>, in meetings and to 
      believers around the world, to <i>wake us up!</i> He appeared <i>after</i> 
      His resurrection and He is about to appear <i>before</i> His second 
      coming! You know a prophetess sent me a word through my wife, right here, 
      and she said 'Tell your husband that Jesus is go'n to <i>physically</i> 
      appear in his meetings.' I am expecting to see, I am telling you that - I 
      feel it's going to happen. I, I, I'm, I'm careful in how I am saying it 
      now, because I know the people in Kenya are listening. I know deep in my 
      soul, something <i>supernatural</i> is going to happen in Nai - in Nairobi 
      Kenya. I <i>feel</i> that. I may very well come back, and you and Jan are 
      coming, to - Paul and Jan are coming to Nairobi with me, but Paul, <i>we 
      may very well come back with footage of Jesus on the platform!</i> You 
      know that the Lord appeared in Romania recently, and there's a video of 
      it? Where the Lord appeared in the back of a church and you see him on 
      video walking down the isle? Yeah! Paul do you remember when I came on TBN 
      years ago and showed you a clip of the Lord appearing in our church in 
      Orlando, on the balcony on the wall? Yeah. You, you remember that? [Paul 
      Crouch] Very well, I saw it! [Benny Hinn] That was '80, 80 something, '86, 
      what - whatever. You know I always wondered why the Lord, why did He do 
      that? Do you know why, now I look back? That was the beginning of the 
      greatest move of God in our church. Because '83, '84, and '85 were 
      horrible years for me, horrible years. Eighty-six the blessings of God 
      began, but they began with a - with this manifestation of the Lord's face 
      on, on the balcony, that stayed for eight weeks. <i>Eight solid weeks</i>! 
      The Lord has done this in the past, but He is about to do it again, now 
      hear this, <i>I am prophesying this!</i> Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is 
      about to appear <i>physically</i> in some churches, and some meetings, and 
      to many of His people, for one reason - to tell you He is about to show 
      up! To Wake Up! Jesus is coming saints! You have held back from the Lord 
      in the past, don't you <i>dare</i> do it now. The day will come you'll 
      stand before Him and give an answer. How <i>dare</i> we not give to God. 
      How <i>dare</i> we hold back.&quot;</p>

      <p>&quot;Let me tell you something. The Holy Spirit has already told me He is 
      about to show up. And you know, oh, I gotta tell you this quickly, just 
      before we go. I had a word of prophecy from Ruth Heflin, you know who Ruth 
      Heflin is? Ruth prophesied over me back in the seventies and everything 
      she said has happened. She just sent me a word through my wife and said 
      the Lord spoke to her audibly and said that He is going to appear <i>
      physically</i> in one of our crusades in the next few months. Yeah, she - 
      I'm telling ya - she said, the Lord spoke to her audibly and said, 'Tell 
      Benny I'm going to appear physically on the platform in his meetings'. 
      Lord, do it in Phoenix Arizona in the name of Jesus! And in Kenya too, 
      Lord, please, Lord, in fact, do it in every crusade. In Jesus' name.&quot;</p>

  <p align="left">Notably, Benny in the March 29th program showed a video clip 
  of a Toronto Canada crusade where he was <i>slaying young people in the spirit</i> 
  saying <b>&quot;FIRE, FIRE, FIRE, ... put FIRE on these kids ... He's being <i>
  electrocuted</i> by God's power ... Fire on you ... I never thought I would 
  see this in Canada, ... FIRE, FIRE, FIRE.&quot; </b>The stage was nearly full of 
  young people who had fallen down and were incapacitated under the alleged 
  imparting of the Holy Spirit. There is no scriptural precedent for &quot;slaying in 
  the spirit&quot;. In fact, it is <i>contrary</i> to the scriptural nature of the 
  Holy Spirit to knock down or incapacitate people, even briefly. Acts chapter 
  2, which describes the great initial outpouring of the Holy Spirit at 
  Pentecost, doesn't have the slightest hint of anyone being &quot;slain in the 
  spirit.&quot; The baptism of fire (Matt 3:11, Luke 3:16) was a visible tongue of 
  fire above the head (Acts 2:3) and <i>not</i> an incapacitating 
  &quot;electrocution.&quot; Slaying in the Spirit is simply <i>unbiblical</i>, and should 
  be considered a counterfeit!</p>
  <p align="left">Signs and wonders may be happening at Benn Hinn crusades, but 
  according to scripture, there can be false and misleading miracles, designed 
  to deceive if possible even the very elect of God:</p>

  <p align="left">So by what means will the elect of God avoid being deceived by 
  false signs, wonders, and miracles? When the government teaches people how to 
  spot counterfeit money, it is not the fake that they study intently, it is the 
  genuine article. When you <i>know</i> the genuine, the fake is then very easy 
  to spot. The only way to spot the false prophets, false signs and wonders, and 
  false miracles, is to be so familiar with the word of God, the Bible, that 
  only the genuine will be accepted, and the counterfeit easily discerned.</p>

  <p align="left">Benny Hinn, desiring a gift from the Holy Spirit (the 
  anointing), represents God as commanding him to give a large sum of money to 
  TBN in order to receive his requested spiritual gift. This suggests that God 
  sells spiritual gifts for a price. Scripture deals explicitly with this 
  situation, and it has been called Simony ever since it was first attempted by 
  Simon the sorcerer:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Acts 8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem 
    heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter 
    and John:<br>
    Acts 8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might 
    receive the Holy Ghost:<br>
    Acts 8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were 
    baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)<br>
    Acts 8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy 
    Ghost.<br>
    Acts 8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands 
    the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,<br>
    Acts 8:19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, 
    he may receive the Holy Ghost.<br>
    Acts 8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou 
    hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.<br>
    Acts 8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is 
    not right in the sight of God.<br>
    Acts 8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps 
    the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.<br>
    Acts 8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the 
    bond of iniquity.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><u>Necromancy</u></font></p>
  <p align="left">On the 4th and 5th of May 2000, Benny Hinn had as a guest, Dr. 
  D. G. S. Dhinakaran of <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.jesuscalls.com/"><b>Jesus Calls</b></a><b> </b>ministry in 
  India, who claims to have been to heaven and back multiple times. While in 
  heaven, he claims to have spoken with Jesus, God the Father, and the apostles 
  Peter and Paul. He described the apostle Paul as a short man, and his spirit 
  soul in heaven still bears the marks of his trials and tribulations while on 
  this earth. The soul in heaven, according to Dr. Dhinakaran, retains the 
  outward appearance of the earthly physical body, which he says, is why Moses 
  could be recognized by the apostles at the transfiguration (Matt. 17:3, Mark 
  9:4, Luke 9:30).</p>
  <p align="left">Again, knowing what scripture teaches about the state of the 
  dead, it becomes clear that Dr. Dhinakaran's visits to heaven are either 
  concocted, or delusional deceptions, because he could not possibly have spoken 
  to the disembodied souls of Peter and Paul. In fact, he is basically repeating 
  Satan's first lie in the garden of Eden to Eve, see <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="death.html"><b>What really happens when you Die?</b></a> Moses was <i>
  not</i> at the transfiguration as a bodyless soul, he had been resurrected 
  (Jude 9), and was as much present in the flesh at the transfiguration as 
  Elijah and Jesus, but Peter and Paul are both still <i>dead</i>, asleep in the 
  grave, awaiting their resurrection at the second coming. Claiming to have 
  contacted the dead (Peter and Paul), is actually necromancy, and is <i>
  forbidden</i> as an abomination by God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Deu 18:10 There shall not be found among you any one that 
    maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth 
    divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,<br>
    Deu 18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, 
    or a necromancer.<br>
    Deu 18:12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and 
    because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from 
    before thee.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The state of the dead is a <i>crucial</i> point to understand 
  as we near the end of time, because it allows one to discern&nbsp; the truth 
  and exposes the deceptions of false prophets and deceiving spirits.</p>

  <p align="left">Benny Hinn was the guest on the May 9th <i>Behind the Scenes

  appearance had not happened.</p>
  <p align="left">The point needs to made that Benny Hinn is a false prophet, 
  not just because Jesus failed to appear in Nairobi, but because scripture <i>
  in advance </i>warned us not to believe a word of what he was saying. Should 
  some supernatural being appear at a future Benny Hinn crusade, <i>it will not 
  be Jesus, </i>no matter how impressive, and no matter what &quot;miracles&quot; are done

        <p>&quot;Today, I do not say, as the old covenant prophets used to say, &quot;Thus 
        saith the Lord&quot;. For thousands of years prophets would say &quot;Thus saith 
        the Lord&quot;, and only when they'd say it, the power of God would fall. But

        out&quot;. Then I heard another voice, that I believe is the voice of the 
        Holy Spirit. He said &quot;Tell the people&quot;, and the atmosphere changed when 
        that happened, He said &quot;Tell the people, I am passing by many, and once 
        I pass by it would be as though I never knew them.&quot; In other words, 
        there's, its, its the last call. Do you remember what He said in the 
        scripture, when, when he said, the young virgins, that some had the oil 
        and some didn't have any? The five wise, the five foolish. It, we are in
