The Achilles Heel of Papal Infallibility</font></b></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Gen 3:15 [KJV] And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and 
  between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise 
  his heel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Genesis 3:15 is widely recognized as what is the called the protoevangelium,
  that is to say, the first proclamation of the coming Savior to redeem a fallen
  human race. As such, it holds a very important place in scripture, and as you
  might imagine, is something Satan would like to corrupt or distort. I have
  recently purchased a copy of the Roman Catholic Douay Rheims, a reproduction 
  of the 1899 edition that bears the Imprimatur of James Cardinal Gibbons, dated 
  September 1, 1899. This is how Gen 3:15 is translated in the Douay Rheims:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>15 I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her
    seed; she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The margin note for that verse reads as follows-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ver 15 <em>She shall crush. Ipsa</em>, the woman; so divers of the
    fathers read this place, conformably to the Latin; others read it<em> ipsum</em>,
    viz., the seed. The sense is the same: for it is by her seed, <em>Jesus
    Christ</em>, that the woman crushes the serpent's head.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Also note the following blasphemy from Alphonsus Liguori, a doctor of the 
  Catholic church:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Not only is the most Blessed Virgin Queen of heaven and of all the
    saints, but she is also Queen of hell and all evil spirits: she overcame
    them valiantly by her virtue. From the very beginning God foretold the
    victory and empire that our Queen would one day obtain over the serpent,
    when he announced that a woman should come into the world to conquer him:
    &quot;I will put enmities between you and the woman. . . .&quot; (Gen 3:15)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who could this woman be but Mary, who by her fair
    humility and holy life always conquered him and beat down his strength? The
    Mother of our Lord Jesus Christ was promised in the person of that woman, as
    St. Cyprian remarks, for God did not say &quot;I place enmities,&quot; as if
    to refer to Eve, but &quot;I will place&quot; to point to Mary in the
    future.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Septuagint says, &quot;And he will crush your
    head,&quot; while the Vulgate version has it, &quot;she will crush your
    head.&quot; This is the [pg. 50] sense known by St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St.
    Augustine, and a great many others.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it really does not matter, whether the Mother
    crushes the head of the serpent through her Son, or the Son overcomes
    Lucifer through His Mother who brought Him into the world to effect this. As
    St. Bernard remarks, this proud spirit, in spite of himself, was beaten down
    and trampled under foot by this most Blessed Virgin. As a slave conquered in
    war, the devil is forced to obey the commands of this Queen.</p>

      <td width="77%">The image at left is a typical Catholic depiction of Mary
        crushing the head of the serpent. This image is also supposed to depict
        the woman of Revelation 12, with a crown of twelve stars around her head
        and the moon at her feet, also sometimes interpreted by Catholics to be
        Mary. This interpretation is quite easily disproved to the Catholic:</td>

  <blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>KJV Rev 12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed
    with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
    twelve stars:<br>
    KJV Rev 12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained
    to be delivered.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the woman in Rev 12 gives birth <em>in pain.</em> Pain in
  childbirth is a penalty imposed on women, by God, for having sinned:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>KJV Gen 3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
    and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
    desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This presents a <em>major</em> problem for the Catholic, since they teach
  as <em>infallible dogma</em> that Mary was born without original sin (the 
  immaculate conception), and so deduce that she must have delivered Jesus 
  without pain, since pain in childbirth is a penalty imposed by God on women 
  for Eve's original sin. Many Catholics are quite unaware of this deduction, 
  and some have suggested I am in error here. Please note the following:</p>
  <p><b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Mary_Full_of_Grace.asp">Mary: Full of
  Grace</a> </b>at Catholic Answers presents the Catholic teaching on the matter
  from the writings of early church fathers and deduces that because Mary bore
  Jesus without pain, that is proof positive that she was free from original
  sin. So to interpret the woman of Revelation 12 as Mary is to say she was a 
  sinner, but this is anathema to the Catholic mind. </p>
  <p>The woman of Revelation 12 is actually symbolic for the true church of 
  faithful believers (the Bible frequently refers to the church as a woman or 
  bride). Note that Daniel 7 clearly states that the saints of God are 
  persecuted for 3 1/2 times, and that in Revelation 12 the woman flees 
  persecution for the exact same time period:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Dan 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall 
  wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and 
  they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of 
  time.</p>
  <p>Rev 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she 
  might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a 
  time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both verses refer to the same period of history, 3 1/2 times, representing 
  1260 literal years of persecution of the saints during the dark ages, the 
  woman of Revelation 12 representing the faithful but persecuted church. The 
  opposite symbol of the apostate <i>persecuting</i> church, drunk with the 
  blood of the saints, is found in Revelation 17, the woman depicted as the 
  whore of Babylon.</p>
  <p>Note also that the woman in Gen 3:16 has <u>children</u> - <i>plural</i>, 
  and Eve definitely had more than one child. So if the woman in Gen 3:15-16 is 
  to be interpreted also as Mary, then not only does she give birth in pain as a 
  result of her sin, she also had to have more than one child as well. But wait! 
  This conflicts with the Catholic dogma of the perpetual virginity of Mary, 
  which asserts Mary had no relations with Joseph <i>ever</i>, and therefore did 
  not have <i>any</i> children after Jesus. </p>
      <p align="center"><b><font size="4">INEFFABILIS DEUS</font></b></p>
  <p>Now here is a direct quote from INEFFABILIS DEUS, the Apostolic
  Constitution Defining the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, by Pope Pius IX
  on the 8th day of December, 1854. My understanding of this document is that it
  is a pillar of Catholicism, to be considered ex-cathedra (from Peter's chair)
  and it is therefore promoted as infallible (free from all error). Under the
  heading of INTERPRETERS OF THE SACRED SCRIPTURES, it reads-</p>

      <p>The Fathers and writers of the Church, well versed in the heavenly
    Scriptures, had nothing more at heart that to vie with one another in
    preaching and teaching in may wonderful way the Virgin's supreme sanctity,
    dignity, and immunity from all stain of sin, and her renowned victory over
    the most foul enemy of the human race. This the did in the books they wrote
    to explain the Scriptures, to vindicate the dogmas, and to instruct the
    faithful. These ecclesiastical writers in quoting the words by which at the
    beginning of the world God announced the merciful remedies prepared for the
    regeneration of mankind--words by which he crushed the audacity of the
    deceitful serpent and wondrously raised up the hope of our race, saying,
    &quot;I will put enmities between you and the woman, between your seed and
    her seed&quot; (Gen 3:15)- taught that by this divine prophecy the merciful
    Redeemer of mankind, Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was clearly
    foretold: <b>that his most Blessed Mother, the Virgin Mary, was
    prophetically indicated</b>; and, at the same time, the very enmity of both
    against the evil one was significantly expressed. Hence just as Christ, the
    Mediator between God and man, assumed human nature, blotted the hand writing
    of the decree that stood against us, and fastened it triumphantly to the
    cross, so <b>the most holy Virgin</b>, united with him by a most intimate
    and indissoluble bond, was, with him and through him, eternally at enmity
    with evil serpent, and most completely triumphed over him, and <b>thus
    crushed his head with her immaculate foot</b>.<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;

<blockquote>
  <p>As I understand it, this &quot;infallible&quot; declaration of the Papacy
  is that Mary will crush Satan's head. Do you see what has happened? It is
  Mary's victory over Satan, that Pius IX claims is prophesied. She has been
  exalted to a co-equal with Jesus Christ in destroying Satan, and she actually
  carries out the deed, not Jesus! Is this not AntiChrist? INEFFABILIS DEUS
  declares that Mary was conceived in her mother's womb without original sin and
  remained sinless throughout her life (Immaculate Conception meaning conceived
  without sin).</p>
  <p>Now 50 years after the &quot;infallible&quot; proclamation of Pius IX, we
  have this astounding statement by Pope Pius X:</p>
  <p align="center">Extract from<br>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b><a
  href="http://www.stthomasaquinas.net/encyclicals/Pius10/P10IMCON.HTM">AD DIEM
  ILLUM LAETISSIMUM</a></b><br>
  ENCYCLICAL OF POPE PIUS X ON THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION<br>
  FEBRUARY 2, 1904</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>6. ... Adam, the father of mankind, looked to Mary crushing the serpent's
    head, and he dried the tears that the malediction had brought into his eyes.
    Noe thought of her when shut up in the ark of safety, and Abraham when
    prevented from the slaying of his son; Jacob at the sight of the ladder on
    which angels ascended and descended; Moses amazed at the sight of the bush
    which burned but was not consumed; David escorting the arc of God with
    dancing and psalmody; Elias as he looked at the little cloud that rose out
    of the sea. In fine, after Christ, we find in Mary the end of the law and
    the fulfillment of the figures and oracles.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Old Testament patriarchs are presented as yearning for the advent of
  the &quot;immaculate&quot; Mary and her victory over Satan! There is one very
  major stumbling block to this - the Bible itself:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
    <p>Rom 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
    by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>
    <p>Luke 1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<br>
    Luke 1:47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mary was a sinner by birth, for all have sinned. Mary herself acknowledges
  her need for a Savior and the Bible says nothing of Mary or any other human
  since the Garden of Eden being sinless, except for Jesus Christ. Yet the Roman
  Catholic Church declares the circumstances of her conception, birth, and life
  to be equal to the Son of God in this respect! Again, isn't this AntiChrist?</p>
  <p>It is interesting to note that the Douay Rheims Bible was not translated
  from the Greek or Hebrew texts, but rather from the Latin
  Vulgate, itself a translation by St. Jerome (342-420 A.D.), although
  it does say it was &quot;compared with the Hebrew, Greek, and other editions
  in divers languages&quot;. This is one reason for the comments in the foot
  note for Gen 3:15. Apparently there is confusion as to whether the Vulgate
  uses Ipsa (woman) or Ipsum (seed). Yet, the publishers of the copy I have say
  &quot;the Douay-Rheims is the most reliable English-language Bible there
  is&quot;, in their preface dated August 24, 1989. (The complete Douay Rheims
  was first published in 1609, with the first revision in 1763.)</p>
  <p>Can the apparent confusion of the Douay Rheims be resolved? Well, how do
  other, more modern, more thoroughly researched Bibles, translate Gen 3:15?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>King James Version- Gen 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
    woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
    shalt bruise his heel.</p>
    <p>New King James Version- Gen 3:15 And I will put enmity between you and
    the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head,
    and you shalt bruise His heel.</p>
    <p>New International Version- Gen 3:15 And I will put enmity between you and
    the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and
    you will strike his heel.</p>
    <p>New Revised Standard Version- Gen 3:15 I will put enmity between you and
    the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head,
    and you will strike his heel.</p>
    <p>Amplified- Gen 3:15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and
    between your offspring and her offspring; He shall bruise and tread your
    head under foot, and you will lie in wait and bruise His heel.</p>
    <p>The New American Bible* for Catholics- Gen 3:15 I will put enmity between
    you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike at
    your head, while you strike at his heel.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Living Bible- Gen 3:15 From now on you and woman will be
    enemies, as will all of your offspring and hers. And I will put the fear of
    you into the woman, and between your offspring and hers. He shall strike you
    on your head, while you will strike at his heel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that they all say that it will be the seed of the Woman, He (Jesus)
  that will strike at Satan, not the woman (Mary, by Catholic interpretation).</p>
  <p>Remember that Pius IX has declared that Mary &quot;crushed his head with
  her immaculate (sinless) foot&quot;? Well, why don't all Bibles read just like
  the Douay Rheims? Why is there nothing in the margin notes about Mary? Clearly
  there is a mistranslation on someone's part. Either the Douay Rheims is in
  error (along with Pius IX, infallible or not), or every single non-Catholic
  Bible, and even some &quot;approved&quot; versions for Catholics, are in
  error. Is it conceivable that all the Protestant Bibles have been
  intentionally mistranslated to contradict the teachings of the Catholic
  Church? Or is it more likely that the mistranslation of the Latin Vulgate,
  perpetuated by the Douay Rheims, has led to faulty doctrine regarding Mary,
  and even &quot;infallible&quot; Papal pronouncements that are really nothing
  of the sort?</p>
  <p>A second Bible with a translation similar to the Douay
  Rheims is a translation by Monsignor Ronald Knox, from the Latin Vulgate
  (in the light of of the Hebrew and Greek Originals) published originally in
  1944, authorized by the Hierarchy of England and Wales, and the Hierarchy of
  Scotland, bearing the Imprimatur of Bernard Cardinal Griffin, the Archbishop
  of Westminster. From the preface by Cardinal Griffin, dated 1954, it would
  seem this translation was (is?) popular, at least in the United Kingdom. This
  is the text of Gen 3:15 as it appears in Monsignor Knox's translation-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:15 And I will establish a feud between thee and the woman, between
    thy offspring and hers; she is to crush thy head, while thou dost lie in
    ambush at her heels.</p>
    <p>The following footnote appears for this verse-</p>
    <p>For 'she' and 'her' the Septuagint Greek has 'he' and 'his'; the Hebrew
    text also, as it has come down to us, gives 'he', or perhaps 'it'. But most
    manuscripts of the Latin version have 'she', which plainly gives us a better
    balance to the sentence. That the reference of this passage, in any case, is
    to the Incarnation, is the general opinion of the Fathers. The Latin here
    assumes that there is a word play upon words in the original, since there
    are two Hebrew verbs closely alike, one which means 'to crush' and the other
    'to follow eagerly'. But the Hebrew text has 'to crush' in both clauses; the
    Septuagint Greek, in both clauses, has 'to lie in wait'.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the Greek Septuagint and Hebrew texts (and even the <i>old</i> 
  pre-Vulgate Latin texts) do not agree with the Latin Vulgate,
  which Monsignor Knox prefers because of better &quot;balance&quot;? Just what
  does that mean? Could it be that he casts aside the Greek, Hebrew, and old 
  Latin texts because
  Jerome's Latin Vulgate (itself a translation) fits the accepted Traditional
  Church teachings better than those other texts? Clearly the integrity of
  the translation has been compromised by dictates of Church Tradition in this
  case. Today we might say that Knox was politically correct in his translation
  of Gen 3:15, but by his own admission in his footnotes, he was not true to the
  Greek and Hebrew texts.</p>
  <p>It has also been noted that the English Bible of John Wyclif, first 
  produced from 1382 to1384, reads <i>&quot;she shall trede thy head.&quot; </i>Since 
  Wyclif's Bible was a literal translation of the Latin Vulgate, this is to be 
  expected, since Wycliff apparently did not know Hebrew. So quite 
  understandably, his Bible reads much the same as the Douay Rheims.</p>
  <p>That Catholics have <i>intentionally</i> changed the 
  reading of Gen 3:15, and are not faithful to the Hebrew, is even admitted 
  in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia in the entry on <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15464b.htm">The Blessed 
  Virgin Mary</a></b>. (See paragraphs 1 and 2.)</p>
  <p>Note how this is explained at this Catholic web site, the Nazareth Resource
  Library: <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="http://www.cin.org/users/james/questions/q105.htm">The Douay-Rheims and
  Gen 3:15,</a> </b>which attributes the Douay Rheims variance to a copyist
  error in some versions of the Latin Vulgate!</p>
  <p>Well the vast majority of English translations  do not say the woman crushes the head of the serpent, but rather
  her seed, (Jesus) does. So who really is the woman? Let's look at a couple
  more verses of the passage to make this clear. From the King James-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><b>God talks to Eve</b></u><br>
    <br>
    Gen 3:13&nbsp; And the LORD God said unto the woman [Eve], What is this that thou 
    hast done? And the woman [Eve] said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.<br>
    <br>
    <u><b>God talks to Satan about his deceiving Eve and the consequences</b></u><br>
    <br>
    Gen 3:14&nbsp; And the LORD God said unto the serpent [Satan], Because thou hast 
    done this [deceived Eve], thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every 
    beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat 
    all the days of thy life:<br>
    Gen 3:15&nbsp; And I will put enmity between thee [Satan] and the woman [Eve], 
    and between thy [Satan's] seed [sinners] and her seed [the Savior] ; it 
    shall bruise thy [Satan's] head, and thou shalt bruise his [the Savior's] 
    heel.<br>
    <br>
    <u><b>God talks again to Eve</b></u><br>
    <br>
    Gen 3:16&nbsp; Unto the woman [Eve] he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow 
    and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy 
    desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.<br>
    <br>
    <u><b>God talks to Adam about following Eve into sin</b></u><br>
    <br>
    Gen 3:17&nbsp; And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice 
    of thy wife [Eve], and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, 
    saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in 
    sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In verses 13 and 16 God is speaking to Eve, and in verse 17 is God speaking directly to Adam. Does anyone doubt that Eve bore her children in pain and
  sorrow as a result of her sin? Or does someone want to propose this did not
  begin until after Mary? Next, is it unreasonable to assume that the woman of
  verse 16 is exactly the same woman spoken of in the preceding verses (13&amp;15)? Does
  the text indicate a change in the identity of the woman on either a literal or
  spiritual level? No it does not. So, the woman in Gen 3:15 is NOT Mary, it is
  Eve. The enmity with Satan began with Eve and her offspring immediately after
  the fall, NOT with the birth of Jesus. Adam and Eve were expelled from garden
  of Eden as a result of their sin, and suddenly had to work and till the soil
  for food. They were forbidden to eat from the tree of life and faced a certain
  death as a result. Who doubts the enmity with Satan and his seed began with
  Adam and Eve? Surely this enmity increased all the more with the world's first
  murder of Able by Cain!</p>
  <p>Catholics read Mary into verse 15 and it is completely unwarranted. The
  woman in the verse is Eve, the serpent is Satan and the seed of the woman is
  Jesus. Yes, Jesus is eventually the seed of (descendant of) Eve, as we all
  are. So Mary is neither mentioned nor intended in Gen 3:15. The verse is
  intended to announce to Adam and Eve that a Savior will ultimately defeat
  Satan, though Satan will injure the Savior (at the cross). It speaks of Jesus,
  the Son of God, coming to redeem mankind on the cross. At the cross when Jesus
  died, Satan thought he had triumphed over the Son of God, but this is equated
  to a wound in the heel. But the resurrection of Jesus was the blow to Satan's
  head that will ultimately result in his death in the lake of fire. It means
  eternal life to those with faith in the atoning blood of Jesus shed at the
  cross to cover their sins. Gen 3:15 is the first announcement to mankind of
  the Savior Jesus Christ, to Adam and Eve and even to Satan, but Mary is not
  even mentioned. And that IS the truth.</p>
  <p>But now following the thread of Gen 3:15 in Catholic documents, we find it
  again in the Apostolic Constitution of Pius XII Defining The Dogma of the
  Assumption (MUNIFICENTISSIMUS DEUS), November 1, 1950, which is also
  ex-cathedra, and purports to declare Mary was taken up into heaven at the end
  of her life. Paragraph 39 reads as follows-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We must remember especially that, since the second century, the Virgin
    Mary has been designated by the holy Fathers as the new Eve, who, although
    subject to the new Adam, is most intimately associated with him in that
    struggle against the infernal foe which, as foretold in the proto-evangelium
    (Gen 3:15), would finally result in that most complete victory over the sin
    and death with are always mentioned together in the writings of the Apostle
    of the Gentiles.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Lest you have any doubt about what Pius XII meant by that, this is what he
  wrote in his encyclical letter of September 8th, 1953, on the centenary of the
  definition of the Immaculate Conception (of Mary, not Jesus) by Pope Pius IX-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the first place, the foundation of this doctrine (the Immaculate
    Conception) is to be found in Sacred Scripture, where we are all taught that
    God, Creator of all things, after the sad fall of Adam, addressed the
    serpent, the tempter and corruptor, in these words, which not a few Fathers,
    Doctors of the Church and many approved interpreters applied to the Virgin
    Mother of God: &quot;I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy
    seed and her seed&quot; (Gen 3:15).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Genesis 3:15 is appealed to again as the first revelation of Mary and her
  enmity with Satan, the serpent. Do you think that this was apparent to Adam
  and Eve in the Garden, to whom God was speaking at the time? Hardly. They knew
  now of the coming Redeemer, but nothing of his mother. It is only as the
  doctrines of Mary were promoted by the Roman Catholic Church that anyone
  attempted to put Mary into this passage. Did the Jews prior to the time of
  Christ see the mother of the expected Messiah in Genesis 3:15? Is there a
  single Jewish commentary that advocates this point of view? I dare say there
  is not. Clearly then, as demonstrated here, it is a Catholic invention to
  support the apostasy of Mariolotry.</p>
  <p>So where does that put Pius IX and his Dogma of the Immaculate Conception,
  and Pius XII with his Dogma of the Assumption of Mary, both infallibly
  declared from the seat of Peter (ex-cathedra), and both appealing to Gen 3:15
  as prophetically speaking of Mary? Might one say the Achilles heel of Papal
  infallibility can be found in the accuracy, or lack thereof, of the Latin
  Vulgate, Douay Rheims Bibles and Knox Bibles, and whether or not Mary is the
  woman of Genesis 3:15, and just who it is that really crushes the head of the
  serpent? Indeed, I believe it can.</p>

  <p>ADDENDUM- the new Catholic Catechism also makes a link between Gen 3:15 and
  the Immaculate Conception-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Paragraph #411 The Christian tradition sees in this passage an
    announcement of the &quot;New Adam&quot; who, because he &quot;became
    obedient unto death, even death on the cross,&quot; makes amends
    superabundantly for the disobedience of Adam. Furthermore many Fathers and
    Doctors of the Church have seen the woman announced in the <em>Protoevangelium</em>
    as Mary, the mother of Christ, the &quot;new Eve.&quot; Mary benefited first
    of all and uniquely from Christ's victory over sin: she was preserved from
    all stain of original sin and by a special grace of God committed no sin of
    any kind during her whole earthly life.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The name Eve appears only 4 times in all of scripture- Gen 3:20, 4:1, 2 Cor
  11:3, and 1 Tim 2:13. None of them speak of the concept of a &quot;new
  Eve&quot;. The first and last Adam, however, are both mentioned in 1 Cor
  15:45-47. The first Adam was earthly and created, the last (Jesus) was
  spiritual and eternal deity, in whom salvation can be found through faith. Who
  seriously wishes to apply this same formula beyond the two Adams?</p>
