  </font><font size="5">Veiled By The Supernatural Darkness</font></p>
  <p><b>God uses thick darkness to veil His Glory:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the 
    thick darkness where God was.</p>
    <p>Deu 4:11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain 
    burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick 
    darkness.<br>
    Deu 4:12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard 
    the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.</p>
    <p>Deu 5:22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount 
    out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with 
    a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of 
    stone, and delivered them unto me.</p>
    <p>1 Ki 8:11 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the 
    cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.<br>
    1 Ki 8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the 
    thick darkness.</p>
    <p>2 Chr 5:14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of 
    the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.<br>
    2 Chr 6:1 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the 
    thick darkness.</p>
    <p>Joel 2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy 
    mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the 
    LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;<br>
    Joel 2:2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick 
    darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a 
    strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after 
    it, even to the years of many generations.</p>
    <p>Zep 1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth 
    greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry 
    there bitterly.<br>
    Zep 1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of 
    wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds 
    and thick darkness,</p>

  <p><b>Darkness from the sixth to the ninth hour:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land 
    unto the ninth hour.<br>
    Mat 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, 
    Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou 
    forsaken me?<br>
    Mat 27:47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This 
    man calleth for Elias.<br>
    Mat 27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it 
    with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.<br>
    Mat 27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save 
    him.<br>
    Mat 27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the 
    ghost.<br>
    Mat 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top 
    to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;<br>
    Mat 27:52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which 
    slept arose,<br>
    Mat 27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into 
    the holy city, and appeared unto many.<br>
    Mat 27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching 
    Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared 
    greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>

    <p><b>The Father Came Down From The Temple In Heaven To Be With His Son At 
    The Cross:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, 
    my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, 
    and my high tower.<br>
    Psa 18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I 
    be saved from mine enemies.<br>
    Psa 18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men 
    made me afraid.<br>
    Psa 18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death 
    prevented me.<br>
    Psa 18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he 
    heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his 
    ears.<br>
    Psa 18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the 
    hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.<br>
    Psa 18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his 
    mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.<br>
    Psa 18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under 
    his feet.<br>
    Psa 18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the 
    wings of the wind.<br>
    Psa 18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him 
    were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
