      <p>Catholic scholars generally date the books of the New Testament to have been 
      written no earlier than some 30 years after the crucifixion, and there 
      isn't even one verse that states the first day of the week was being 
      observed in place of the seventh day Sabbath. Not one verse of the New 
      Testament associates the keeping of Sunday with honoring the resurrection. 
      Patrick Madrid has no scriptural proof for his assertion.</p>

      That is <i>not</i> an accurate statement. Christians are free to worship 
      on any day of the week, including Sunday. However, the Sabbath commandment 
      of God can neither be kept, or broken, on Sunday the first day of the 
      week. The Sabbath commandment can only be kept or broken on the specified 
      day, the seventh 
      day of the week, which is Saturday.</p>

      First, note that in Exodus 20:8-10, the Lord God said to Moses, <i>
      “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and 
      do all your work; but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; 
      in it you shall not do any work....”</i> This commandment was a “perpetual 
      covenant” that God wanted His people to observe through the ages (cf. Ex 
      31:16-18; cf. Dt 5:12). Henceforth, the Jews observed the Sabbath on 
      Saturday, resting from all work and emulating God’s own rest on the 
      Seventh Day of creation (cf. Gn 2:1-3).</font></p>

        Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line

      <p>The seventh day of the week, as specified in God's commandment, is <i>
      not</i> kept holy and sanctified as a day of rest by the Catholic Church, 
      as Cardinal Gibbons candidly attests. God's seventh day Sabbath has indeed 
      been abandoned by the Catholic Church, and by most Protestants as well.</p>

            Rather, observance of the Third Commandment to “keep holy the 
            Sabbath” was <i>transferred</i> to Sunday, also known as the 
      &quot;Lord’s Day” (cf. Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2; ), because it is through His

      Here Patrick very effectively concedes that the Catholic Church does <i>not</i> keep the 
      Sabbath commandment as written by the finger of God. Neither Acts 20:7 or 
      1 Cor 16:2 use the phrase &quot;Lord's Day&quot;, and none of the verses he 
      cites demonstrate the keeping of the first day of the week in place of the 
      seventh day Sabbath to celebrate the resurrection, since there is no such 
      testimony in all of the New Testament.</p>

      Around the year A.D. 100, the <i>Didache</i> instructed Christians to 
      “gather together on the Lord’s Day.” In A.D. 155, St. Justin Martyr wrote 
      a letter to the Roman emperor mentioning that the early Church celebrated 
      the Eucharistic Liturgy on Sundays instead of Saturday. This practice was 
      already universal.</font></td>

      Since the inspired Bible is silent regarding the keeping of Sunday in 
      place of the Saturday Sabbath, there 
      being no &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; on the matter, the unbiblical and 
      uninspired Traditions of 
      men are now appealed to in order to legitimize changing one of the Ten 
      Commandments of God.</p>

      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      The primary reasons the early Church transferred the observance of the 
      Third Commandment from Saturday to Sunday are these:<br>
      <br>
      1) Sunday is the day Christ rose from the dead (cf. Mt 28:1-6; Jn 20:1). 
      And as St. Paul said, if Christ did <i>not</i> rise from the dead, we are 
      the most pitiable of people because our faith is in vain.</font></td>

      </div>
      <p align="left">
      There is no doubting the importance of the resurrection, however, there is 
      only one day of the week that God ever blest and sanctified as a holy day:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that 
      in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      As important as the resurrection of Christ is, no where in the New 
      Testament are we told that that event abolishes the keeping of the Sabbath 
      commandment, or that Christ or the Apostles in any way instituted the 
      keeping of Sunday to honor the resurrection.</p>
      <div align="center">

        <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFD9D9">

      <p align="left">
      That's to say that a motivating factor in the change to Sunday was 
      anti-Semitism. That is true, but that is <i>not</i> a valid reason for 
      changing one of the Ten Commandments of God.</p>

            This included their abandonment of Judaism’s system of ritual animal 
            sacrifices. Christ is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the 
            World [cf. Jn 1:29, 36), and His perfect sacrifice replaced the Old 
      Covenant Passover lamb that was ritually slain and consumed as mere symbol 
      of sacrifice for sin.  </font></td>

      The animal sacrifices of the Mosaic Covenant did prefigure or symbolize the 
      sacrifice of Christ, and when Jesus died on the cross, the temple veil was 
      torn from top to bottom (Matt 27:51), signifying the end of need for the 
      Levitical priesthood and animal sacrifices to approach God for 
      forgiveness. Jesus, the lamb of God, was now our High Priest, and Mediator between 
      God and man for the forgiveness of sins. Again however, anti-Semitism is <i>
      not</i> the reason for the institution of the New Covenant.</p>

      3) The early Christians wanted to show forth the true meaning of the 
      Sabbath, which achieved its full purpose in the New Covenant of Christ, in 
      whom we find our perfect, ultimate rest. <i>“Come to me, all you who are 
      heavily burdened, and I will give you rest”</i> (Mt 11: 28).</font><p>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      4) The Old Covenant (including the Sabbath, temple ceremonies, animal 
      sacrifice, etc.) prefigured in a shadowy, incomplete, and imperfect way 
      the perfect fulfillment by Christ in and through the New Covenant. The Old 
      Covenant observances were but “types and shadows of heavenly realities” 
      (cf. Heb 8:5; cf. Heb 10:1). Once the perfect had come, the imperfect 
      prefigurements passed away. This is as true of the way the Church observes 
      the Third Commandment as it is with baptism replacing the Old Covenant 
      ordinance of circumcision.</font></td>

      The yearly ceremonial sabbaths were indeed shadows of events to come, 
      which is to say they were prophetic in nature, but they are not part of the Ten 
      Commandments. The seventh day Sabbath, on the other hand, is a <i>memorial</i> 
      to creation (Exo 20:11), and the Creator, that we are commanded to 
      remember (Exo 20:8) by refraining from working (Exo 20:10). This <i>

      Covenant. But in Christ, we are no longer bound by the Old Covenant. So

      Actually, Christ in those verses omitted reciting all the commandments 
      regarding one's duty to God, the commandments of the first table of stone, 
      although they all are surely included in verse 17:</p>
      <blockquote>

            But the fact is, the Catholic 
      Church was established by Christ and was granted by Him the authority to 
      “bind and loose” (cf. Mt 18:18) and teach with His own authority (cf. Lk 
      10:16, Mt 28:18-20). Now, since Christ revealed that He is the Lord even 
      of the Sabbath day (cf. Mt 12:8; Mk 2:28; Lk 6:5), and that the Sabbath 
      was made for man, not man for the Sabbath (Mk 2:27), it follows that His 
      Church also has a share in that authority (cf. Mt 10:40).</font><p>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
      As Christ said to Simon Peter, <i>“I will give you the keys of the kingdom 
      of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and 
      whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven”</i> (Mt 16:19; cf. 
      18:18-20).</font></td>

      Binding and loosing in Matthew 18, in context, is dealing with a brother 
      that has fallen into sin (Mat 18:15), and the subsequent process the 
      church (not just Peter) is to follow (vs. 16-20). It does <i>not</i> give 
      the church blanket authority to supersede, rescind, or modify any of the 
      Ten Commandments. </p>
      <p align="left">
      What does &quot;the keys of the kingdom of heaven&quot; refer to?</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Mat 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son 
      of the living God.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      That Jesus is the Christ, is rock upon which the church is built (v.18).</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      John 3:16 <font color="#CC3333">For God so loved the world, that he gave 
      his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, 
      but have everlasting life.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Salvation through faith in Jesus Christ is the Gospel, the testimony of 
      both the Old and New Testaments, the keys of the kingdom of heaven. The 
      binding and loosing of Matt 16:19, again, is explained in chapter 18, and 
      deals with the specific process for church discipline of those who have 
      fallen into sin. It does <i>not</i> give the church unlimited authority.</p>

      Notice also that the Seventh-Day Adventists themselves do not observe the 
      “eternal commandment” of circumcision given by God to Abraham in Genesis 
      17. This commandment predated the Ten Commandments given to Moses by 
      hundreds of years. It has no less weight of authority than the Ten 
      Commandments. And yet, as even Seventh-Day Adventists are forced to admit 
      (since they do not practice ritual circumcision), even though the Bible 
      shows that Jesus Christ nowhere expressly taught that God’s commandment 
      regarding circumcision was to be changed to the sacrament of baptism, the 
      Church had the authority — <i>His</i> authority — to enact that change. In 
      so doing, it did not abandon God’s eternal commandment regarding 
      circumcision, but instead, it observed that commandment in a new and 
      perfected form, that of the sacrament of baptism (cf. Gal 3:27-29; Col 
      2:11-12).</font><p>
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
            This is an excellent parallel with the Church’s authority to 
            transfer the observance of the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday. It 
            was not an abandonment of God’s Law, but rather a fulfillment and 
            perfecting of that Law.</font></td>

      <b>The Seventh Day Sabbath:</b> Began at creation, when it was instituted, blessed, and 
      sanctified by God (Gen 2:3). It's purpose is to be a sign between God and 
      His people that He is Jehovah God that sanctifies them (Exo 31:13, Eze 
      20:12, 20).</p>

      <b>The Abrahamic Covenant:</b>
      Circumcision began with Abraham and his seed (Gen 17:7, 10), the male 
      being circumcised the eighth day after birth (v. 12), and was a physical 
      sign or outward token of the Abrahamic covenant (v. 11). That covenant was 
      that Abraham would be a father of many nations, and that Canaan was to be 
      an everlasting possession (vs. 4-8). With the Gospel going to the Gentiles 
      after the stoning of Stephen, the Abrahamic covenant&nbsp; is no longer 
      limited to the physical bloodline descendants of Abraham, but also includes the 
      Gentiles who are spiritual descendants by faith:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Rom 2:25 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if 
      thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.<br>
      Rom 2:26 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the 
      law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?<br>
      Rom 2:27 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the 
      law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the 
      law?<br>
      Rom 2:28 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that 
      circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:<br>
      Rom 2:29 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that 
      of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of 
      men, but of God.</p>

      <b>The Mosaic Covenant: </b>Began with Moses at mount Sinai, and was a 
      promise of obedience to God. The ark in which the two tables of the Ten

      9:4).</p>

      Exo 19:6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. 
      These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.<br>
      Exo 19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid 
      before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.<br>
      Exo 19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD

      <b>The Baptism of Believers: </b>John the Baptist (Matt 3) began baptizing 
      Jews<i> before</i> the public ministry of Jesus, which is to say, before 
      the Christian church came into existence, and Jesus Himself commanded that 
      it be done:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Mat 28:19 <font color="#CC3333">Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, 
      baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
      Ghost:</font><br>
      Mat 28:20 <font color="#CC3333">Teaching them to observe all things 
      whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto 
      the end of the world.</font> Amen.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Note the sequence, teach and then baptize. Baptism by full immersion is to be a public 
      confession of faith by the believer. Infant baptism by sprinkling as taught and 
      practiced by Roman Catholics is not found in scripture, and is an 
      erroneous Tradition of men. Baptism is the biblical way of celebrating the 
      resurrection of Christ, not Sunday keeping.
      Paul tells us it is a symbolic expression of faith in the death of the old 
      man (the sinner) with Christ, and our <i>resurrection</i> with Him in newness of 
      life:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      Rom 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ 
      were baptized into his death?<br>
      Rom 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like 
      as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so 
      we also should walk in newness of life.<br>
      Rom 6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, 
      we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:<br>
      Rom 6:6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the 
      body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">
      The Jerusalem council (A.D. 49) in Acts 15, seeing that God was blessing 
      uncircumcised Gentiles with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:45), as testified to by Paul, Barnabus, and Peter, concluded that God was not requiring circumcision of 
      Gentiles, so neither should they. James also concluded that this was in 
      agreement with scripture (Acts 15:15), quoting Amos 9:11-12. So did the 
      apostolic church, exercising a presumed divine authority, unilaterally 
      decide to abolish circumcision? No, obviously not. As cited above (Rom 
      2:29), the external physical circumcision of the flesh for Jews has become 
      the internal spiritual circumcision of the heart for Gentiles, according 
      to the plan of God, not by church decree.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Baptism is clearly biblical, as it was practiced by John the Baptist 
      several years before the Christian church began, and was commanded by 
      Jesus, but did the apostolic church decree that baptism should replace 
      circumcision? No, as Patrick rightly points out, scripture does not 
      testify to any such decree. Neither can the Catholic Church cite any 
      scripture where the apostolic church abandoned the seventh day Sabbath for 
      the first day of the week, or that they kept Sunday to honor the 
      resurrection. The truth is that both Sunday keeping in place of the 
      seventh day Sabbath, and infant baptism, are unbiblical corruptions and 
      Traditions of men.</p>
      <p align="left">
      So baptism does not provide Catholics with biblical support for any 
      alleged church authority to abolish or modify one of the Ten Commandments 
      of God, which is amply demonstrated by the very words of Christ that 
      Patrick now quotes:</p>
