    Daniel 7:25 In The Catechism Of The Catholic Church</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr></span><span class="text">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Dan 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most 
    High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change 
    times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times 
    and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">In this verse, the word &quot;times&quot; refers to the prophetic set 
  times of God found in the Bible, with an emphasis on God's Sanctuary and the 
  pre-advent judgment. The word &quot;laws&quot; refers to the Ten Commandments of God, 
  with an emphasis on the Sabbath commandment. This is evident from the 
  corresponding message of Rev 14:7. The 3 1/2 times refers to a 
  prophetic period of 1260 years (538 A.D. - 1798 A.D), after which the little horn's 
  dominion would cease, the breach of God's Sabbath law would be repaired, and 
  the gift of prophecy would be restored to the true church. This pairing of the 
  &quot;law and the prophets&quot; just before the second coming was prophesied in the Old 
  Testament:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mal 4:4 <u>Remember ye the law of Moses</u> my servant, which I 
    commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments.<br>
    Mal 4:5 Behold, <u>I will send you Elijah the prophet</u> before the coming of the 
    great and dreadful day of the LORD:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">The restoration of the gift of prophecy before the second 
  coming is also prophesied by Joel:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Joel 2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm 
    in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the 
    day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;<br>
    ...<br>
    Joel 2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my 
    spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your 
    old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:<br>
    Joel 2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days 
    will I pour out my spirit.<br>
    Joel 2:30 And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, 
    and fire, and pillars of smoke.<br>
    Joel 2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, 
    before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Note however that when God's law is transgressed in 
  apostasy, the gift of prophecy is removed:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Lam 2:8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the 
    daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his 
    hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; 
    they languished together.<br>
    Lam 2:9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her 
    bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: <u>the law is no 
    more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</u></p>
    <p align="justify">Ezek 7:26 Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour 
    shall be upon rumour; <u>then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but 
    the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</u></p>
    <p align="justify">Jer 18:18 Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices 
    against Jeremiah; for <u>the law shall not perish from the priest, nor 
    counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.</u> Come, and let us 
    smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</p>
    <p align="justify">Jer 26:4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the 
    LORD; <u>If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law</u>, which I have 
    set before you,<br>
    Jer 26:5 <u>To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets</u>, whom I 
    sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not 
    hearkened;<br>
    Jer 26:6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a 
    curse to all the nations of the earth.</p>
    <p align="justify">Neh 9:26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled 
    against thee, and <u>cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets</u> 
    which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great 
    provocations.</p>
    <p align="justify">Prov 29:18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: 
    but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.</p>
    <p align="left">Isa 30:9 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, 
    children that <u>will not hear the law of the LORD</u>:<br>
    Isa 30:10 Which say <u>to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy 
    not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:</u><br>
    Isa 30:11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy 
    One of Israel to cease from before us.</p>
    <p align="left">Zec 7:11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the 
    shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.<br>
    Zec 7:12 Yea, <u>they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they 
    should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his 
    spirit by the former prophets</u>: therefore came a great wrath from the 
    LORD of hosts.<br>
    Zec 7:13 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not 
    hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:<br>
    Zec 7:14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom 
    they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed 
    through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</p>
    <p align="left">Prov 28:9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, 
    even his prayer shall be abomination.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">So, based on the above testimony, we would expect that the 
  little horn of Daniel 7:25, who opposes God's laws by thinking to change the 
  Sabbath, would also oppose the gift of prophecy that is to be manifested in 
  the true church before the second coming. This is because by transgressing 
  God's law in apostasy, the prophetic gift is lost. We turn now to the most 
  recent <b> <i><a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></i></b> regarding the Sabbath:</p>

        <p align="justify"><b><a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c1a3.htm#2175">2175</a></b> Sunday is expressly distinguished from 
        the sabbath which it follows chronologically every week; for Christians 
        its ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's 
        Passover, Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and 
        announces man's eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared 
        for the mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some 
        aspects of Christ:<sup>107</sup> </p>

  <p align="justify">That the Roman Catholic Church claims to have substituted 
  Sunday for the Sabbath is well <b><a href="notsun.html">documented</a></b> from 
  history. I will cite one striking example:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="justify">63. ... Christians, called as they are to proclaim the 
  liberation won by the blood of Christ, felt that they had the authority to 
  transfer the meaning of the Sabbath to the day of the Resurrection. ...</p>
  <p align="justify">67. ... <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Christians 
  will naturally strive to ensure that civil legislation respects their duty to 
  keep Sunday holy. ...</font></p>
  <p align="justify">68. ... Sunday rest then becomes &quot;prophetic&quot;
  <font face="Times New Roman">... . — </font>Pope John Paul II, <b><i>
  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html">Dies Domini.</a></i></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">It only remains to examine what the Catholic Church has to say regarding the 
  gift of prophecy, that the Bible clearly teaches is to be restored to the 
  saints of God just prior to the second coming.</p>

        <p align="justify"><b><a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a1.htm#65">65</a></b> &quot;In many and various ways God spoke of old

        us by a Son.&quot;<sup>26</sup> Christ, the Son of God made man, is the 
        Father's one, perfect and unsurpassable Word. In him he has said 
        everything; there will be no other word than this one. St. John of the 
        Cross, among others, commented strikingly on <i>Hebrews </i>1:1-2: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="justify"><span class="text1"><font size="2">In giving us his

          what he spoke before to the prophets in parts, he has now spoken all 
          at once by giving us the All Who is His Son. Any person questioning 
          God or desiring some vision or revelation would be guilty not only of 
          foolish behavior but also of offending him, by not fixing his eyes 
          entirely upon Christ and by living with the desire for some other 
          novelty.</font></span><sup><font size="2">27</font></sup></p>

        <p align="justify"><b>There will be no further Revelation</b> </p>

        public revelation is to be expected before the glorious manifestation of 
        our Lord Jesus Christ.</u>&quot;<sup>28</sup> Yet even if Revelation is already 
        complete, it has not been made completely explicit; it remains for 
        Christian faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the course 
        of the centuries. </p>
        <p align="justify"><b>67</b> <span class="text1">Throughout the ages, 
        there have been so-called &quot;private&quot; revelations, some of which have been 
        recognized by the authority of the Church. They do not belong, however, 
        to the deposit of faith. It is not their role to improve or complete 
        Christ's definitive Revelation, but to help live more fully by it in a 
        certain period of history. Guided by the Magisterium of the Church, the
        <i>sensus fidelium</i> knows how to discern and welcome in these 
        revelations whatever constitutes an authentic call of Christ or his 
        saints to the Church. </p>
        <p align="justify">Christian faith cannot accept &quot;revelations&quot; that 
        claim to surpass or correct the Revelation of which Christ is the

  <p align="justify">The phrase &quot;public revelation&quot; is explained at the
  <b> <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Private_Revelation.asp">Catholic 
  Answers</a></b> web site:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Public revelation is binding on all Christians, but private revelation is 
  binding only on those who receive it. The Catholic Church teaches that public 
  revelation was completed, and therefore was concluded, with the death of the 
  last apostle (Vatican II, <i>Dei Verbum</i> 4), but private revelation has 
  continued. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">So, paragraph #66 in the <b> <i><a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a></i></b> 
  explicitly denies that the public gift of prophecy will be manifested in the 
  church before the second coming. This is in direct opposition to the teaching 
  of scripture, as demonstrated in Joel and Malachi above. Jesus tells us that 
  there is a direct association between keeping God's commandments and the gift 
  of prophecy:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="justify">John 14:15<font color="#FF0000"> If ye love me, keep my 
  commandments.</font><br>
  John 14:16 <font color="#FF0000">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give 
  you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</font></p>
  <p align="justify">John 16:13 <font color="#FF0000">Howbeit when he, the 
  Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not 
  speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he 
  will show you things to come.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">John in the Revelation also confirms that the end time 
  remnant church both keeps the Ten Commandments of God, and possesses the gift 
  of prophecy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war 
    with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have
    <u>the testimony of Jesus Christ.</u></p>
    <p align="justify">Rev 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See 
    thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the 
    testimony of Jesus: worship God: for <u>the testimony of Jesus is the spirit 
    of prophecy.</u></p>
    <p align="justify">Rev 22:9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy 
    fellowservant, and of thy brethren <u>the prophets</u>, and of them which 
    keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="justify">The Apostle Paul also states that the spiritual gift of 
    prophecy (1 Cor 12:4-11, Eph 4:11-13) will be present in the remnant church: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">1 Cor 1:4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the 
    grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;<br>
    1 Cor 1:5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and 
    in all knowledge;<br>
    1 Cor 1:6 Even as the testimony of Christ (Rev 19:10) was 
    confirmed in you:<br>
    1 Cor 1:7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our 
    Lord Jesus Christ:<br>
    1 Cor 1:8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless 
    in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
	  <p class="auto-style1"><strong>The place of the Lord's sanctuary was cast 
	  down.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
	<p align="left">The earthly Aaronic priesthood that offered sacrifices at 
	the temple in Jerusalem ended when Jesus was crucified, which was symbolized 
	by the vail of the temple being torn in half. As our only high priest, Jesus 
	now ministers to repentant sinners in a heavenly sanctuary. </p>

		distortion of the concept of repentance and the lack of effort to live 
		an authentically Christian life. And on the other hand, it is being <b>

<p class="auto-style2">The Pope is saying that a Catholic <i><b>must</b> </i>
seek out a priest to confess their sins and ask forgiveness <b><i>only through 
the priest,</i></b><i><b> </b></i>and that this &quot;sacrament&quot; of 
confession/penance is undermined by those who think they can directly approach 
God directly for forgiveness. This makes the Catholic priest essential in the 
process of salvation, since he stands in the place of God, as another mediator 
between man and God. This is not a novel teaching in the Catholic Church, is has 
a long history:</p>
<blockquote class="auto-style2">
	<blockquote>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Leo the Great (440-461) writes: &quot;God in His abundant

		Those who have violated the vows of their Baptism may obtain the 
		remission of their sins by condemning themselves; the divine goodness 
		has so decreed that [pg. 284] <b>the pardon of God can only be obtained 
		by sinners through the prayers of the priests</b>. Jesus Christ Himself 
		has conferred upon the rulers of the Church the power of imposing 
		canonical penance upon sinners who confess their sins, and of allowing
