<title>Is Pope John Paul II in Heaven?</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">Is Pope John Paul II in Heaven?</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I was the first caller on James White's <i><a href="http://aomin.org/index.php?catid=12&amp;blogid=1">Dividing Line</a></i> 
  on Thursday, 14 April, 2005, and discussed with him where the Pope is today. The 
  conversation then turned to the Investigative Judgment, and briefly the 
  Sabbath/Sunday issue. <a href="http://aomin.org/dl1.ram">Here's the program</a>. 
  (Real Player). </p>
  <p align="left">Unless otherwise noted, the King James is quoted. </p>
  <p align="left">The text in boxes was not part of the program, and presents my 
  additional responses (which are subject to additions or revision) to the comments of Dr. White. 
  So bear in mind that Dr. White was not responding to the boxed text during the 
  program.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">My call begins at 21:40 into the program, and this is my 
  transcript of it.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - As you know, Catholics teach there are three 
  possibilities upon a person's death. </p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - Right.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - And I think we would agree that Purgatory is not true.</p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - You and I hopefully would agree about that, Yes.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - And the other two possibilities, one that the Pope's 
  immortal soul would be in Hell&nbsp; right now.</p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - Right.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - Or that his immortal soul is in heaven.</p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - Right.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - And I would like to read if I may seven verses</p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - Sure.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - from the King James</p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - Well if you want to use the King James.</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - and I will let the verses speak for themselves.</p>
  <p align="left">DR. WHITE - (laughs)</p>
  <p align="left">MIKE - [These verses are then read]:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eccl 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not 
    any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is 
    forgotten.<br>
    Eccl 9:6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; 
    neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done 
    under the sun.</p>
    <p>Psa 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom 
    there is no help.<br>
    Psa 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very 
    day his thoughts perish.</p>
    <p>Psa 115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into 
    silence.</p>
    <p>James 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is 
    your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then 
    vanisheth away.</p>
    <p>Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>MIKE - Did the serpent tell the truth or not?</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - O.K., and</p>
  <p>MIKE - I propose to you that the Pope is neither in Heaven, or Purgatory, 
  or in what Catholics would call Hell, but the Pope is unconscious, asleep in 
  his grave.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - I <i>see</i>! Well, there is a little problem with that, and I 
  noticed as soon as you went to Ecclesiastes 9, I was going to say, now, you 
  need to be careful Ecclesiastes is talking about from the earthly viewpoint, 
  but then when you went to the others I could tell where you were going 
  eventually.</p>
  <p>MIKE - I figured you would.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Yeah, Yeah, the problem there is the fact that Paul teaches 
  that to be absent from the body is to be home with the Lord.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>2 Cor 5:6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we 
        are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:<br>
        2 Cor 5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<br>
        2 Cor 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from 
        the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br>
        2 Cor 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may 
        be accepted of him.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>MY REPLY - Jesus equated death with sleep, so Paul is saying that 
      should he die, he would sleep the sleep of death, and he would next see 
      Jesus Christ after being resurrected. To Paul, however, the passing of 
      time after his death would be as an instant, the blink of an eye, and his 
      next thing he would know it would be the second coming, and the 
      resurrection of all the righteous saints to meet the Lord.</td>

  </div>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Peter taught us that the Lord knows how to keep under 
  punishment those who are awaiting the day of judgment, that punishment is an 
  ongoing thing, it is not just simply a promise of a future situation. </p>
  <div align="center">

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <blockquote>
          <p>2 Pet 2:9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of 
          temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be 
          punished:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>MY REPLY - Just when are the unjust judged? If they are held in 
        reserve <i>before</i> their judgment, how fair is it of God to torment 
        them in a conscious state in a fiery Hell <i>before</i> that judgment 
        even occurs? </p>
        <p align="left">The judgment of the wicked is during the great white throne judgment 
        (Rev 20:11), when all the wicked have been&nbsp; resurrected from their 
        graves - &quot;But the rest of the dead (the wicked) <i>lived not again</i> 
        until the thousand years were finished.&quot; (Rev. 20:5), and this is <u>after</u> the millennium. Their punishment is to be cast into the 
        lake of fire (Rev. 20:14-15), which is called the <i>second</i> death. 
        What then of the first death? It is the unconscious sleep in the grave. 
        At the second coming the righteous dead will awake from that sleep, and 
        be resurrected to be with the Lord (John 14:2-3), but the wicked dead 
        will continue to be held in the grave through the 1000 years, 
        totally unconscious, awaiting their resurrection and judgment before the great 
        white throne. It is only <u>after</u> their judgment that they are cast 
        into the lake of fire. There is no lake of fire today, so there is no 
        one being tormented  in any fiery hell today.</td>

  <p>DR. WHITE - And the idea of mere unconsciousness would also have some problems 
  with those martyrs in the book of Revelation [Rev. 6:9-11]. </p>

        <td width="100%">MY REPLY - The martyrs under the altar are speaking 
        symbolically, just as Abel's blood cried out for justice (Gen. 4:10). See my article <a href="Souls-under-altar.html">The Souls

  <p>DR. WHITE - I can at least see how some might argue for the wicked, even 
  though Peter has a problem with that, but certainly for the righteous there is 
  immediately the presence of Christ. And so I am aware of the arguments that 
  you would be putting forth. The problem is would you be coming from a 
  Seventh-day Adventist perspective?</p>
  <p>MIKE - Absolutely.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - I see, yeah.</p>
  <p>MIKE - I am a Seventh-day Adventist</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Well, you know, this particular issue would be one we would 
  certainly disagree on, but far more importantly to me, would you be one of 
  those Seventh-day Adventists that would hold to the Investigative Judgment?</p>
  <p>MIKE - Oh Absolutely.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Yeah, see I would put that as being as false a gospel as 
  Rome's. Personally I don't see any difference between the Investigative 
  Judgment and the grounds that places one's relationship to God on, and what 
  Rome teaches.</p>
  <p>MIKE - Well, I really didn't call for, to discuss the Investigative 
  Judgment, although I would be happy to if you wanted to.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Well, the point</p>
  <p>MIKE - My point was, and I didn't comment on the verses, I let them speak 
  for themselves, and I think they are very clear that when a person dies, his 
  thoughts perish.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - From the earth.</p>
  <p>MIKE - There is no conscious immortal soul that goes to Heaven or to Hell.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - You just read something in there. Your first comment was 
  correct, your second comment demonstrated a tradition that then tries to tie 
  these things together. That's where the difference is. </p>

        <tr>
          <td width="100%">MY REPLY - The serpent said:<blockquote>
            <p>Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely 
            die:<br>
            Gen 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your 
            eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and 
            evil.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>God had said:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Gen 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every 
            tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br>
            Gen 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou 
            shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou 
            shalt surely die.</p>
            <p>Gen 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou 
            return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou 
            art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>God said they would surely die and return to the dust. The serpent 
          said they would not surely die, they would be like God. Did God tell 
          the truth or did the serpent tell the truth? The serpent lied, and 
          that first lie involved death. The serpent (Satan) denied death, he 
          told Eve she was immortal, that she would not perish for disobeying 
          God. The doctrine of the immortal soul is a doctrine of demons. God 
          only has innate immortality (cf.1 Tim. 6:16). The apostle Paul tells 
          us when the righteous receive <i>conditional</i> immortality:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>1 Cor 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last 
            trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised 
            incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br>
            1 Cor 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this 
            mortal must put on immortality.<br>
            1 Cor 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, 
            and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought 
            to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in 
            victory.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Paul says he is mortal, subject to death, but he receives his 
          immortality at the last trump, at the second coming. Paul is not an 
          immortal soul blissfully in heaven, he is still corrupt, dead, asleep 
          in his grave:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a 
            shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: 
            and the dead in Christ shall rise first:<br>
            1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up 
            together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and 
            so shall we ever be with the Lord.<br>
            1 Th 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>When does Paul meet the Lord in the air, ever to be with him? At 
          the general resurrection of the righteous, at the second coming, not 
          before. And why is the immortality received conditional? </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Rev 2:7 <font color="#FF0000">He that hath an ear, let him hear 
            what the Spirit saith unto the churches; <u>To him that overcometh 
            will I give to eat of the tree of life</u>, which is in the midst of 
            the paradise of God.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The immortality received at the second coming is dependent on 
          continued access to the tree of life. Adam and Eve were condemned to 
          surely die by denying them access to the tree of life (Gen. 3:22-24). 
          People simply cannot live forever independent of the tree of life.</p>
          <p>So it is Dr. White who reads scripture with the glasses of Catholic 
          Tradition on, and denies or redefines death, as did the serpent. He 
          has been taught, and unwittingly subscribes 
          to, Satan's lie about death told to Eve in the garden of Eden.</td>

  <p>DR. WHITE - For example, in Ecclesiastes chapter 9, there is many things 
  said in Ecclesiastes concerning all is vanity. Well, O.K. in a particular 
  context on earth we understand what's being said there, but you certainly are 
  not going to take that to mean that there is nothing that has meaning in this 
  life. So you are doing the same thing in trying to say, well their memory is 
  gone from this earth, they no longer have any interaction on this earth. I 
  would agree completely. That doesn't mean however</p>
  <p>MIKE - Verse 6 says &quot;their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now 
  perished&quot;</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - And that's, yes.</p>
  <p>MIKE - In other words their whole - and verse 5 is saying their memory is 
  forgotten, in other words their memory has perished. </p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Umhum. </p>
  <p>MIKE - In other words their consciousness is gone. They have no 
  consciousness.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Na Na Na Na Na NO. That's, that's no. You see your reading that 
  into it. </p>
  <p>MIKE - Well, isn't that what Psalm 146:4 says? </p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - This is on the earth</p>
  <p>MIKE - &quot;In that very day his thoughts perish.&quot;</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - This is on the earth, this is not, Yeah, on the earth yes.</p>

        <p>There are two fates listed there, to perish or to have everlasting

        <p>John tells us that to perish is to <u>not see life.</u> Death is a 
        complete absence of life, and at death consciousness and memory cease, 
        which is why scripture calls it a sleep. Death does <u><i>not</i></u> 
        mean your consciousness simply leaves earth in an immortal soul for 
        Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory. The phrase <i>immortal soul</i> is never

  <p>DR. WHITE - What are, what are the shades in Isaiah 12 and 14? What are 
  they doing when the spirits of these wicked kings comes to them? What are 
  these individuals? Who are these things? How do they know this is a king? 
  There's clearly conscious existence at that point. </p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">MY REPLY: In Isaiah 14:9 in the New Revised Standard 
        Version it uses the word &quot;shades&quot;:<blockquote>
          <p>NRSV Isa 14:9 Sheol beneath is stirred up to meet you when you 
          come; it rouses the <u>shades</u> to greet you, all who were leaders 
          of the earth; it raises from their thrones all who were kings of the 
          nations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The King James translates the same verse this way:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>KJV Isa 14:9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at 
          thy coming: it stirreth up the <u>dead</u> for thee, even all the 
          chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the 
          kings of the nations.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The word translated as &quot;shades&quot; or &quot;dead&quot; is Strong's H7496 - (rapha', 
        raw-faw'; from H7495 in the sense of H7503; prop. lax, i.e. (fig.) a 
        ghost (as dead; in plur. only):--dead, deceased.) It is used in Job 
        26:5, Psa 88:10, Prov 2:18, 9:18, 21:16, Isa 14:9, 26:14, and 26:19. 
        Let's look at the last use for a moment:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>NRSV Isa 26:14 The dead do not live; shades do not rise-- because 
          you have punished and destroyed them, and wiped out all memory of 
          them.</p>
          <p>KJV Isa 26:14 They are dead, they shall not live; they are 
          deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and 
          destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once again, we are told the dead <i>do not have life</i>, they have 
        been <i>destroyed</i>, and their memory has <i>perished</i>. The dead do 
        not take up a ghostly conscious state somewhere else, they remain in 
        their grave, dead, their memory and thoughts have completely ceased.</p>
        <p>So what then of the kings in Isaiah 14:9? Well, first of all, note 
        that trees are talking in verse 8? So there is symbolism to a degree in 
        Isaiah 14. In context the main character of Isaiah 14 is Lucifer (KJV v. 
        12), which is to say Satan. The trees symbolize the redeemed, rejoicing 
        over the demise of Satan. It is Satan being met by the resurrected 
        wicked dead, including the kings of the earth, in verse 9. When does 
        this happen? At the second resurrection, the resurrection that occurs at 
        the conclusion of the 1000 years, so that the wicked can face the great 
        white throne judgment. The same kings are mentioned in Rev. 19:18-19. At 
        the conclusion of the great white throne judgment, Satan and all the 
        wicked will be cast into the lake of fire. Thus the wicked about to 
        perish in the second death (Rev. 2:11, 20:6, 20:14, 21:8) remark to 
        Satan:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Isa 14:10 All they [the wicked] shall speak and say unto thee 
          [Satan], Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto 
          us?<br>
          Isa 14:11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy 
          viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And what is the result of the lake of fire? Satan is also described 
        in Ezekiel 28:12-19 with the symbolic name of the king of Tyre:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Ezek 28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of 
          thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I 
          bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and
          <u>I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth</u> in the sight of all 
          them that behold thee.<br>
          Ezek 28:19 All they that know thee among the people shall be 
          astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and <u>never shalt thou be

  <p>DR. WHITE - But the reason I went to the issue, in asking you where you are 
  coming from, is because I tend to think that, unfortunately, a lot of these 
  discussions, especially with a believing conservative Seventh-day Adventist, 
  misses the point. Because to me, I could sit around and talk with a Roman 
  Catholic about, oh, let's say, papal infallibility, which we've done. And 
  that's important, it speaks to issues of authority. That would be sort of like 
  talking to you about the claims that Ellen G. White made about concerning her 
  prophecies and her writings in relationship to scripture and things like that. 
  But If that's all I ever discussed, I'm, I'm not doing you any favor, because 
  the real issue, and the issue I always get to with Roman Catholics, is the 
  issue of what the gospel is - what is most important. And that's why I raised 
  the issue, because to me you can be a non-Seventh-day Adventist and believe 
  what you believe about the afterlife. But to be a Seventh-day Adventist what's 
  definitional, what is uniquely definitional and what's more important, what 
  addresses the specific issue of the gospel is the issue of the Investigative 
  Judgment. That's why I raised the issue, that's why I mentioned it. And in 
  fact since I am seeing,&nbsp; looking in the chat channel here, that almost no 
  one has any idea what that is -</p>
  <p>MIKE - Ah, That doesn't surprise me.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - I'll even give you the opportunity, if you can do it briefly, 
  to explain what is the Investigative Judgment. How would you define it if you 
  could do so briefly?</p>
  <p>MIKE - Well at the second coming, there is the division of the sheep and 
  the goats, the resurrection of the <strike>living</strike> righteous [dead] at 
  the second coming. And for that to determination to have been made there must 
  have been a judgment that these people were in fact righteous, that they had 
  faith in Jesus Christ. So there has to be, I think in Revelation, I don't have 
  it in front of me, Revelation 22, it says that when He comes His reward is 
  with Him (Rev. 22:12), the last few verses in Revelation.</p>

        <td width="100%">ADDITIONAL COMMENT: Notice that human probation closes 
        in verse 11, the first phase of judgment ends, and then Jesus speaks 
        about His second coming. So there is a pre-advent judgment:<blockquote>
          <p>Rev 22:11 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which 
          is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him

        </blockquote>
        <p>At the second coming, as Paul describes, the righteous dead are 
        resurrected first, and the living righteous who will not see death are 
        transformed, both then possessing glorified bodies, and only at that 
        point they enter into eternal life.</p>
        <blockquote>

          prevent them which are asleep.<br>
          1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, 
          with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the

          1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up 
          together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so

          trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised 
          incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br>

  <p>DR. WHITE - O.K. let me make sure people heard that. So in 1844, and this 
  was involved with the Miller movement</p>
  <p>MIKE - Yes.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Christ entered into the Sanctuary, and since that period of 
  time, the lives of those individuals who have trusted in Him for salvation 
  have been brought before Him in the inner sanctuary and He has examined them. 
  And what did Ellen G. White say was the basis, upon which, Christ would apply 
  His atoning sacrifice to them or not?</p>
  <p>MIKE - Well the biblical answer is by faith.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Is that all?</p>
  <p>MIKE - I don't know which quote of Ellen White you might be referring to.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - So, that's all. Why would there be an examination of their 
  lives if the only ones being examined were those who had believed in him 
  anyways.</p>
  <p>MIKE - Well God doesn't need to do this examination for His benefit.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - O.K.</p>
  <p>MIKE - In other words, He already knows, He is omniscient. </p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Right.</p>
  <p>MIKE - But the heavenly host are not [omniscient]. O.K., so the books are 
  opened not only for the Lord to examine, but the books are really opened for 
  the heaven hosts to examine the books to see that God's judgment has been 
  righteous.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - And what books are these?</p>
  <p>MIKE - The book of life.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - O.K.</p>
  <p>MIKE - The Lamb's book of life is really the one that's being examined.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - And the only way into that is by</p>
  <p>MIKE - And if you appear in the Lamb's book of life, then you, at the 
  second coming, assuming you had died and were not alive at the second coming -</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Right.</p>
  <p>MIKE - All those that are resurrected, is the resurrection - I think its in 
  Thessalonians (1 Thess 4:13-16) says those who are asleep in the Lord.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - O.K., but how do you get in there? How do you get into the 
  Lamb's book of life? So what's the basis?</p>
  <p>MIKE - By faith.</p>
  <p>DR. WHITE - Faith alone, it's not examination of your life?</p>
  <p>MIKE - Well, by faith you appear in the Lamb's book of life.</p>

          <p>Here is a quote from Ellen White regarding the book of life:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When we become children of God, our names are written in the Lamb's 
          book of life, and they remain there until the time of the 
          investigative Judgment. Then the name of every individual will be 
          called, and his record examined by Him who declares, &quot;I know thy 
          works.&quot; If in that day it shall appear that all our wicked deeds have 
          not been fully repented of, our names will be blotted from the book of 
          life, and our sins will stand against us. If the professed believer 
          becomes self-confident, if in word or spirit he breaks the least 
          precept of God's holy law, he misrepresents Jesus, and in the Judgment 
          the awful words will be spoken, &quot;Blot out his name from the book of 
          life; he is a worker of iniquity.&quot; But the Father pities the 
          self-distrustful, God-fearing soul, harassed though he may be with 
          doubts and temptations. Jesus pleads for him, and confesses his name 
          before the Father and his holy angels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He who is to be our judge knows our works. He 
          understands every temptation and trial, and I am glad of it. He knows 
          the circumstances that surround every soul. He knows our weaknesses, 
          and is touched with the feeling of our infirmities. &quot;If any man sin,&quot; 
          says John, &quot;we have an advocate with the Father! Jesus Christ the 
          righteous.&quot; Oh, how precious is the name of Jesus, and how precious 
          every name that he confesses before the Father! When our gracious 
          Redeemer says of the poor penitent, &quot;He is mine; I have graven his 
          name on the palms of my hands,&quot; the answer comes, &quot;I will not blot his

    </font></b>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p.127]<br>
    ...<br>
    <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone may say: I thought 
    that when Christ forgave my sins, He took them clear away. Yes, He did, so 
    far as you are concerned. He promises to make us as white as snow. But this 
    does not mean that the sins are finally disposed of. He takes them from us, 
    but the record is still there. We are free because we have accepted Him as 
    our substitute and sin bearer, but the record of sin is held in the 
    sanctuary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>DR. WHITE - This then becomes the basis for the discussion which says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another may ask, Why could not Christ have immediately 
    blotted out the sins of the people? Why wait until after 1844? We reply: 
    There must come first an investigation of the records. That is essential. 
    Here is a man who has accepted Christ. His sins have gone on before him into 
    the sanctuary, but Christ cannot blot those sins out of the record until the 
    man's life is finished, or until probation closes for him. Why not? Because 
    he may not continue in faith, and we are told in Ezekiel 33:12, 13, that if 
    the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, all the righteousness 
    that he has done shall not be remembered. If he does not continue in faith, 
    all his past sins will come back upon him again. Jesus does not plead before 
    the throne of God in the final judgment for one who has died in sin. He 
    cannot plead His blood in behalf of one who, though once a Christian, 
    refuses to continue in His grace. Thus before the Lord can blot out the sins 
    from the record books, a very careful examination has to be made to see 
    whether those who accepted Christ have remained true. [“Be thou faithful unto 
    death,” says the Scripture, “and I will give thee a crown of life.” 
    Revelation 2:10.] It is not the beginning of the race that gives assurance of 
    the crown of life; it is the successful finishing.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>DR. WHITE - That then is what leads him into the discussion of the 
    Investigative Judgment, and he says of the Investigative Judgment:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p. 128]<br>
    ...<br>
    <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the judgment the names 
    of those who were once Christians but who have given up their faith in 
    Christ, are blotted out of the book of life.<br>
    ...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>DR. WHITE - That's in regard to Revelation, chapter 3. And then finally, 
    ah just one last, two little quotes here. Under The Law of Judgment it says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">[p. 129]<br>
    ... Without this, trial would be a farce, and the decisions rendered, a 
    travesty on justice. God must of necessity, therefore, have a law by which 
    He will test men's lives, a standard by, which they will be measured; and if 
    so, surely in this solemn hour, when court week has actually begun and cases 
    are already being tried, it behooves every man to inquire seriously what 
    that standard, or code, is, and to take the necessary steps to bring his 
    life into harmony with it before his name is called.<br>
    ...</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - And then the application then becomes:</p>
    </font>
  <blockquote>
    <font FACE="TimesNewRoman">
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">[p. 130]<br>
    ... Do not allow yourself to be deceived, therefore, into believing that 
    nine points of the law will suffice, and the Sabbath point can be dropped 
    out as nonessential.<br>
    </font><font FACE="TimesNewRoman" SIZE="2">...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - That being a part of the code by which a person 
    is going to be judged. So does it not follow then, that a person can believe 
    in Christ, but if they do not, for example, follow Ellen G. White's 
    understanding of the Sabbath law, then Christ will refuse to apply His blood 
    to that individual in the Investigative Judgment?</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - Ah, Seventh-day Adventists do not believe, well they 
    believe that <strike>the Sabbath</strike> [Sunday] is the mark of the beast, 
    as I am sure you know.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - Yes. Well, that Sunday worship is the mark of 
    the beast.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - But Adventists do not believe that anyone has the 
    mark of the beast as yet. In other words, in the last 2000 years the Sunday 
    keepers that did so, fully believing that they were in God's will, that will 
    not be counted against them.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - Is that what Ellen G. White believed?</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - Yes.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - O.K.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - It's only when the mark of the beast is, comes before 
    the world, and is enforced by <i>law, </i>that people are faced with a 
    choice as to whether or not they take the seal of God, which we believe to 
    be the Sabbath, the 7th day Sabbath, Saturday, or the mark of the beast, 
    which would be Sunday keeping. So, it's an issue that will be before the 
    world shortly, but it is not something for which people will be condemned in 
    ignorance.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - But to boil it all down, fundamentally, would

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - Yes it does.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - O.K., and you would then, obviously, Seventh-day

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - Well, that's a topic unto itself, but I believe you

    whether or not we follow Christ, or not.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - You have probably heard our discussions with 
    Dave Hunt and -</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">MIKE - I believe we are faced with a choice, and that choice 
    is either to accept Christ's righteous blood, or to reject it. And to reject 
    it is to be lost.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">DR. WHITE - And to accept Christ's righteous blood though, 
    is not enough if you do not continue, and if your life does not measure up 
    to the standards that are going to be used -</p>
