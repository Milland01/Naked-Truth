<title>Satan's Impersonation of Christ Predicted? Revelation 17 Expounded

<p align="center" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px">NOTE: The 
following interpretation has been clearly and undeniably proved to be erroneous 
by the election of Pope Francis on March 13, 20132. It remains online here, 
uncorrected, for archival purposes, so that it can be studied in detail to learn 
precisely where the error(s) of interpretation occurred.</p>

  <p>The following interpretation apparently first surfaced in Adventist colleges shortly after 
  the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II, and I first posted it on 
  the web back in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961220124311/http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/satan.htm">
  1996</a>. We will soon know if this interpretation is true or not.</p>
  <p>The table below illustrates what might be called a <i>macro</i> 
  interpretation of the seven heads and seven kings of Daniel and Revelation. In 
  other words it is a &quot;big picture&quot; interpretation, which equates the 7 heads / 
  mountains / kings with 7 empires:</p>

  <p>That a mountain can symbolically represent a kingdom is evident from Isaiah 
  29:8 and Daniel 2:35. What I would like to explore in some detail might be a 
  called a <i>micro</i>, or magnified close-up interpretation of the seven heads 
  and seven kings of Daniel and Revelation. This does not discard the <i>macro</i> 
  interpretation, where mountains are empires, but rather builds on it. That the 
  7 heads are defined as <i>both</i> seven mountains and seven kings in 
  Revelation 17:9-10, strongly indicates <i>multiple</i> meanings or 
  fulfillments, with the 7 kings being distinctly different from the 7 
  mountains. (Unless otherwise noted, the King James Bible is quoted)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:1</b> And there came 
    one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, 
    saying unto me, Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment of the great 
    whore that sitteth upon many waters:</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The verse sets the context of what follows in Revelation 17. John is shown 
  the <i>final</i> phase of the great whore, her judgment for the sins she has 
  committed.&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:2</b> With whom the 
    kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the 
    earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here John is told the great whore is charged with having an illicit 
  relationship with kings, and making the people drunken on her wine. She has 
  used the kings of the earth to carry out her persecutions, and she has taught 
  the people her apostate doctrines, truth mixed with error.</p>

      <td>In 
      scripture, the symbol of a woman is used to depict a church, a group of

      art my people&quot; (Isaiah 51:16).<p>Note that John sees the great whore<i> sit </i>
      on a scarlet beast. A beast is used to depict a 
      political state, such as the lion, bear, and leopard of Daniel 7, 
      representing the kingdoms of Babylon, Medo-Persian and Greece 
      respectively. </p>
      <p>The woman/whore  represents an

<blockquote>
  <p>Note also that the beast (state) that the woman (church) rides has seven 
  heads and ten horns, just as Satan is described in Revelation 12.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great 
    red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his 
    heads.<br>
    <br>
    Rev 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the 
    Devil, and Satan, ...</p>

  <p>The parallel characteristics indicate that Satan is very much involved with 
  the church state entity described.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:4</b> And the woman was 
    arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious 
    stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and 
    filthiness of her fornication:<br>
    <b>Rev 17:5</b> And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON 
    THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here the great harlot is identified as Mystery Babylon, the great mother 
  church, and her daughter churches are likewise harlots. The mother church is 
  described as lavishly dressed in the colors purple and scarlet, having a 
  golden cup in her hand. This precisely identifies the Catholic Church. John is 
  told she is a mother, with harlot daughters, this means that John is seeing 
  the <u>post-Reformation</u> era Catholic Church.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">The Harlot Church's Missing Color</font></u></b></p>
  <p align="left">The garments of the high priest of Israel, according to the 
  Bible, contained specific colors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 28:3 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise 
    hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make 
    Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the 
    priest's office.<br>
    Exo 28:4 And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, 
    and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and 
    they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he 
    may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br>
    Exo 28:5 And they shall take gold, and <u>blue</u>, and purple, and scarlet, 
    and fine linen.<br>
    Exo 28:6 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of <u>blue</u>, and of 
    purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.<br>
    Exo 28:7 It shall have the two shoulder pieces thereof joined at the two 
    edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.<br>
    Exo 28:8 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of 
    the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of <u>blue</u>, and 
    purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So, the garments of the high priest include purple, scarlet, 
  and blue, but blue is notably absent in the description of the woman of 
  Revelation 17:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:4 And <strong>the woman was arrayed in purple and 
    scarlet colour</strong>, and decked with gold and precious stones and 
    pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness 
    of her fornication:</p>

  <p align="left">So regarding the whoring harlot church, though she claims to 
  be God's representative on earth, the missing color blue in her description 
  indicates that she actively disregards and transgresses the law of God. One of 
  the characteristics of the antichrist power is lawlessness:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[NIV] 2 Th 2:3 Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will 
    not come until the rebellion occurs and <u>the man of lawlessness</u> is 
    revealed, the man doomed to destruction.</p>
    <p>[NIV] 2 Th 2:7 For the secret <u>power of lawlessness</u> is already at 
    work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is 
    taken out of the way.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And, note what the antichrist little horn power tries to change:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:25 And he [little horn] shall speak great words against the most 
    High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and <u>think to change 
    times and laws [of the most High]</u>: and they shall be given into his hand 
    until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The only one of the ten commandments of God that deals with time is the 
  sabbath commandment (Exo. 20:8-11), which the Catholic Church claims to have 
  changed, from Saturday the seventh day, to Sunday, the first day of the week.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">A Persecuting Church</font></u></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:6</b> And I saw the 
    woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the 
    martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John is being shown the Catholic Church <i>after</i> her 1260 year period 
  of dominion and bloody persecution has come to an end, and she stands guilty 
  before God of the blood of countless Christian martyrs. Note that the beast 
  she rides is scarlet in color, scarlet red with the blood of saints.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>For 1260 years the papacy ruled over Europe, from 538 to 1798. During 
    these dark ages the papacy exercised both political and ecclesiastical 
    power, the woman <i>rode the beast</i>, the beast <i>that was</i>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The papacy lost its political power <a href="h-wound.html">February 15th, 1798</a>, with the capture of Pius VI 
    by the armies of Napoleon, and it lost the last of the
    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, on 
    September 20th, 1870 when Italian troops seized the city of Rome, leaving 
    the Pope a virtual prisoner in the Vatican. The Catholic Church had lost her political 
    power and sovereignty, consequently the beast <i>was not</i>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Now, John in chapter 17, sees the harlot in her final phase, <i>after</i> 
    she has <i>regained</i> her lost political power (sit on the beast), and the world wonders at 
    her revival. Papal sovereignty was restored February 11th, 1929 with the signing of the 
    <a href="wound.html">Lateran Treaty</a> with Benito Mussolini. And <i>yet the beast is</i>. It has 
    ascended back out of extinction, or the bottomless pit, and proceeds from

  <p>This unquestionably points to the city of Rome, the city of seven hills, in 
  which the apostate church headquarters itself. Note that the mountains/hills 
  in this interpretation are literal hills.</p>

  <p>Now based on the first 9 verses, this study will presume that there is an 
  application of the symbols in Revelation 17 to the revived beast, the beast <i>
  that yet is</i>, the post 1929 papacy. Therefore, in the subsequent verses, 
  John is shown in detail critical information about the beast that &quot;yet is&quot;, 
  the revived church-state power of the papacy, following the 1929 revival of 
  political sovereignty, when the Pope became a King again.</p>

    <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">What Is a &quot;Head&quot; in Scripture?</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Daniel tells king Nebuchadnezzar that <i>he</i> is the head of gold:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 2:37 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath 
    given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.<br>
    Dan 2:38 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field 
    and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath <b>made 
    thee ruler</b> over them all. <b>Thou art this head of gold</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p align="left">In scripture the &quot;head&quot; is the one with 
kingly authority:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 15:17 And Samuel said [to Saul], When thou wast little in thine own 
    sight, wast thou not made <b>the head of the tribes of Israel</b>, and the 
    LORD <b>anointed thee king</b> over Israel?</p>
    <p>2 Ki 9:6 And he arose, and went into the house; and <b>he poured the oil 
    on his</b> [Jehu's] <b>head</b>, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God 
    of Israel, I have<b> anointed thee king</b> over the people of the LORD, 
    even over Israel.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 11:3 But I would have you know, that <b>the head of every man is 
    Christ</b>; and the <b>head of the woman is the man</b>; and the <b>head of 
    Christ is God</b>.</p>
    <p>Eph 4:15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all 
    things, which is <b>the head, even Christ</b>:</p>
    <p>Eph 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as <b>Christ is 
    the head of the church</b>: and he is the saviour of the body.<br>
    Eph 5:24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be 
    to their own husbands in every thing.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">The 4 Heads of Greece: a Template</font></u></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In Daniel chapter 7, Daniel sees a leopard with four heads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:6 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had 
    upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also <b>four heads</b>; 
    and dominion was given to it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who is this leopard? It is paralleled by the goat in Daniel 8, which is 
  plainly identified:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn 
    that is between his eyes is the first king.<br>
    Dan 8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms 
    shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The great horn is Alexander the Great of Greece. Who are the four heads of 
  the leopard? The four generals of Alexander the Great that succeeded him:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Seleucus.<br>
    2. Lysimachus<br>
    3. Cassander<br>
    4. Ptolemy</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Using Greece (the leopard with 4 heads) as a template, it is reasonable 
    to conclude that an animal with multiple heads symbolically represents two 
    distinct phases of an empire, and that the heads exist <i>only</i> in the 
    second phase, as Alexander (the body of the leopard) had to fall before the 
    four heads had dominion. Therefore, the beast with 7 heads represents two 
    phases, and the 7 heads/kings <u>only have dominion in the second phase of 
    existence</u>, the beast that &quot;yet is&quot;.</p>
  <p>So when Revelation 17:10 interprets the 7 heads as 7 kings, that is exactly 
  what it means in the strictest sense. It is telling us about 7 literal kings. 
  In the context of the previous verses, these 7 kings rule from the city of 
  Rome, after the great harlot church has regained the power of the state, and 
  so rides the beast again.</p>

  <p>As demonstrated in the above verse, the word <i>onoma</i> can designate a
  <i>title, </i>rather than a name. Revelation 13:1, therefore, tells us a 
  blasphemous title is found on all 7 heads of the beast. Note how the New 
  International Version reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:1 And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast 
    coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on 
    his horns, <b>and on each head a blasphemous name.</b> [NIV]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <i>same title</i> of blasphemy is found on <i>all</i> 7 kings. 
  Revelation 13 also give us a clue that directs us to that title in the last 
  verse of the chapter:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:18 <b><font color="#000000">Here is wisdom</font></b>. Let him 
    that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number 
    of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000000"><i><b>Here is wisdom</b></i> is a link to Rev 17:9, 
  which points us to the great harlot church that rules from Rome, the city on 7 
  hills.</font> So, the &quot;seven kings&quot; are literal kings, seven consecutive Popes 
  of Rome. The blasphemous title is <font color="#000000">Vicar of the Son of 
  God / <b>Vicarius Filii Dei</b>, the Roman Numerals of which equal <b>666</b>.
  </font></p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Identifying The Sixth King</font></b></u></p>
  <p>The time hack or reference point for &quot;five are fallen&quot; is the serious 
  wounding, which John witnesses in Rev 13:3:</p>

  <p>Pope John Paul II was seriously wounded May 13th, 1981 in an attempted 
  assassination in St. Peter's square, he was shot twice with a 9mm pistol and 
  seriously wounded in the abdomen, right arm and left hand, but he recovered 
  after two operations and two and a half months in hospital. That it was a 
  nearly fatal wounding is attested to by Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican 
  Secretary of State, and even the Pope himself:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>He [John Paul II] had been very close to death, and he himself explained 
    his survival in the following words: “... it was a mother's [Mary's] hand 
    that guided the bullet's path and in his throes the Pope halted at the 
    threshold of death”</p>

  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="4">Pope Predicted a Short Reign to 
  Cardinals<br>
  </font></b></u><br>
  NICOLE WINFIELD<br>
  Associated Press</p>
  <p align="left">VATICAN CITY - [Apr 21, 2005] Pope Benedict XVI predicted a 
  &quot;short reign&quot; in comments to cardinals just after his election, and his 
  brother said Wednesday he was worried about the stress the job would put on 
  the 78-year-old pontiff. Joseph Ratzinger has had ailments in the past, 
  including a 1991 hemorrhagic stroke, that raise questions about how long his 
  papacy will last - and whether the world will watch another pope slowly 
  succumb to age and ailments on a very public stage. Benedict was the oldest 
  pontiff elected in 275 years. ... Chicago Cardinal Francis George said 
  Ratzinger, who had repeatedly asked John Paul to let him retire, told the 
  cardinals, &quot;I too hope in this short reign to be a man of peace.&quot; ...</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>The 10 Kings</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:12</b> And the ten 
    horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as 
    yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.<br>
    <b>Rev 17:13</b> These have one mind, and shall give their power and 
    strength unto the beast.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The ten horns are the kings of the earth, who turn over their authority to 
  the returned Christ (actually Satan).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:14</b> These shall make 
    war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of 
    lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, 
    and faithful.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Under the leadership of Satan impersonating Christ, war will be waged 
  against the remnant church of God, just as Saul persecuted the Christians 
  before being converted on the road to Damascus.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:12 ... Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the 
    devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he 
    hath but a short time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that 
    they should believe a lie:<br>
    2 Th 2:12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had 
    pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Saul thought he was serving God by seeking out and killing Christians. 
  Those deceived into accepting Satan as Christ (the strong delusion) will 
  initially think they are serving God, and they will make war against God's 
  true chosen people. Before his election to the papacy Cardinal Joseph 
  Ratzinger was the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, 
  which is the modern name for the Office of the Inquisition!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:15</b> And he saith 
    unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, 
    and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above verse parenthetically identifies the waters where the great 
  harlot sits as covering many peoples and nations. Her rule is universal. 
  Catholic means universal. The whore, like Satan in Ezekiel 28:2, has set 
  herself in the seat of God, over many waters: &quot;... and thou hast said, I am a 
  God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; ... .&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:16</b> And the ten 
    horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and 
    shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her 
    with fire.<br>
    <b>Rev 17:17</b> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to 
    agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall 
    be fulfilled.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The only place in scripture where the prescribed penalty for sin was to be 
  burned by fire was for a harlot daughter of the high priest:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by 
    playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The kingdoms of the earth initially are taken in by the great deception, 
  but soon discover the truth. They turn on the great whore, and destroy her 
  with their own hands by fire, the specified penalty in Lev. 21:9.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="background-color: #FFFFB3"><b>Rev 17:18</b> And the woman 
    which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the 
    earth.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
