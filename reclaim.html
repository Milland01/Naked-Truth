<blockquote>
  <p><b>BOSTON</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>ENI</i>) The Massachusetts Council of
  Churches has expressed deep concern that sports events and other public
  activities on Sunday mornings are deterring Christians, particularly children,
  from attending church.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council, which represents 15 Protestant
  denominations in the state of Massachusetts, has officially called on public
  officials and others who arrange public events to &quot;avoid imposing
  impediments to religious worship.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a &quot;Statement of Concern&quot; sent to the
  1,675 congregations of its 15 member churches last month, the council declares
  that Sunday &quot;is the Day of the Lord, a Day of Reverence . . . To be told
  to re-schedule our worship, as has occurred sometimes, is insulting.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement urges people to &quot;make a commitment
  to reclaim Sunday as a Sabbath time set apart&quot; and encourages them to
  contact school committees, sports officials and civic leaders in a bid to
  ensure that a solution is found to the problem.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This issue causes considerable conflict within
  families when children are placed in the position of having to choose between
  church or recreational activities,&quot; said Diane Kessler, executive
  director of the council.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some clergy groups have tried to address the
  problem in their individual communities, but our board of directors felt it
  was time to take a broader approach and raise this dilemma as a topic for
  discussion and education across the state. Our objective is to get people in
  communities to work together in a positive manner on this problem.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sports consciousness is the rage,&quot; said the
  Rev. Jordan Dickinson, pastor of the First Congregational Church in the town
  of Whitman.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot of the scheduling conflicts are based on
  the explosion of sports and the lack of [sports] fields.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rev. Scott MacLean, pastor of the First
  Congregational Church in the town of Stoughton, said: &quot;We think kids
  deserve the right to play and pray, but when the soccer league starts in the
  spring, our Sunday school attendance is cut in half.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The council said that sport was not the only event
  which produced difficulties for Sunday morning worship ­ others included
  marathons, charity walks and parades.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scheduling charity walks for Sunday morning has
  struck me as odd, because it would seem that the folks who are most likely to
  be concerned about charity are in church then,&quot; Mr. MacLean said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rev. William Wolkovich, parish priest at the
  Catholic parish of St. George, in Norwood, supported the council's views.
  &quot;Parents are torn because the kids are sometimes told they will be put
  off the team if they miss a game . . . As clergy it is our position that it is
  very unfair to make youngsters make a choice between church and participating
  in these activities.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rev. John Maheras, priest in charge of the Greek
  Orthodox parish of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary, in Cohasset, said:
  &quot;Sunday morning is probably the last bastion of time that is left to the
  family to get together.&quot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clergy in Massachusetts have discussed the possibility
  of helping to pay for special lighting for athletic fields so that sports
  events can be held in the evenings.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If the broader community becomes sensitized to
  this issue, we're sure people can work together to come up with all sorts of
  inventive solutions,&quot; Ms. Kessler said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We hope that in a time when many community
  leaders are talking about the need for family values, we can make people aware
  that attending Sunday morning services provides a major source of moral
  education for children.&quot;
