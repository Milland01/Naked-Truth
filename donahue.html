      Catholic League President William Donahue<br>
      at Justice Sunday II, August 14, 2005</font></strong></p>
      <hr>
      <p align="justify">Announcer: Please welcome the President of the Catholic 
      League, Bill Donahue.</p>
      <p align="justify">(Standing ovation) </p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Thank you. Thank you so 
      much.
  It’s great to be here amongst friends.&nbsp; You know, I know a lot of people in 
  the media are wondering why are Catholics and evangelicals getting together, I 
  got news for you: <i>Get used to it</i>, alright! (applause)</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We’re here 
  because we’re concerned about the culture.&nbsp; The heart and soul of any culture 
  has always been religion, but in our society over the last thirty - forty 
  years, it seems that the courts are trying to take the heart and soul of our 
  culture.&nbsp; The courts are making the decisions for us.&nbsp; It’s not the 
  legislative branches.&nbsp; And look at the decisions that they’re making. They’re 
  making it up out of whole cloth.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They come up with this idea in 1965 of a constitutional right to privacy.&nbsp; And 
  then in 1973 they come up with the idea that somehow its okay to kill the 
  kids, that this is somehow reproductive rights. This is a man-made kind of 
  situation, people.&nbsp; There’s nothing in the Constitution which would allow 
  anyone to argue that you can in fact abort a child. That is simply made up by 
  the judges. (applause)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, equal protection before the laws was written in 1868 so you couldn’t 
  have one law for whites and one law for blacks.&nbsp; How did they go from that to 
  the idea that two guys can get married? How do you figure that one out?</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you get the other idea of eminent domain. We understand that. The 
  government takes the right of property to make a highway, not to make some 
  rich developer richer.&nbsp; And this is what the judges have been doing and it has 
  nothing to do with the reality that you and I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me tell you something, I think, you know, Judge Roberts – good man, 
  that’s fine.&nbsp; Personally, I’ve had it with these people who, all they want to 
  do is tinker with the courts.&nbsp; I think we need a constitutional amendment 
  which says, unless the decision by the Supreme Court is unanimous, nine to 
  nothing, you cannot overturn an act of congress. That’s what we need, we need 
  to go beyond Roberts.&nbsp;(applause)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That idea by the way is not new.&nbsp; That idea was by Chief Justice John 
  Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice of the United States.&nbsp; It was seconded by 
  Sydney Hook, the Marxist, former Marxist professor whom I studied under at New 
  York University.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look, Thomas Jefferson certainly knew that we had to have co-equals in the 
  branches.&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson understood <i>even then</i> that the judges were making 
  up their authority independent of what the Constitution granted.&nbsp; So we can’t 
  have this.&nbsp; We have to certainly respect the Supreme Court, but the Supreme 
  Court is supposed to be a co-equal.&nbsp; You don’t like it when judges usurp their 
  authority, I wouldn’t like it either.&nbsp; I don’t want it with the executive 
  branch, I don’t want it with the legislative branch, and it seems to me we’ve 
  got to do something about this.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when you mention structural change, the Left says “well, wait a minute, 
  that’s really a major change.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, they’re the ones always saying to us, the 
  conservatives, “you have a hard time with change.” <i>They’re</i> the ones that have 
  a hard time with change!&nbsp; But you know what? We need to send in counselors for 
  them, to deal with change.&nbsp; (laughter)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, we won’t send in any priests or ministers or rabbis because we respect the 
  fact that they don’t believe in anything.&nbsp; We’re going to send them grief 
  counselors.&nbsp;Right. So, just like they do in the schools.&nbsp; And the grief counselors will, 
  in fact, probably, hold their hands because that’s what they do for a living.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, because we respect that fact that they don’t believe in anything.&nbsp; 
  They believe in what I call the King Kong theory of creation: you know all of a sudden 
  one day there were a bunch of apes up in a tree and then - <i>kerplunk</i> – 
  they fell down, lost most of their hair and started walking around, that was 
  Adam and Eve.&nbsp; If they want to believe that, that’s okay. Alright? So we have to respect 
  that, that’s where these people are coming from.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I’m telling you, I’ve gotten this over the radio shows in the last 
  couple of weeks.&nbsp; Remember, I’m in New York City, I’m not down south.&nbsp; And 
  I’ve been hit up with the same question over and over and over again: <i>&quot;Why are 
  you going to be with the evangelicals&quot;</i>?&nbsp; And I said “what is wrong with 
  evangelicals?”&nbsp; What have they ever done to me?&nbsp; What are you talking about?&nbsp; 
  And you know, they talk about you people, they demonize you people in a way 
  that, that if you did it about any other segment of the population they’d call you 
  a bigot.&nbsp; Well, when somebody demonizes you, they<i> are </i>a bigot.&nbsp; (applause)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let’s see, who are the people going 
  after John Roberts?&nbsp; It’s not evangelicals, I know who they are. Here’s 
  one guy who said this a week ago on “Meet the Press” – this is a proposed 
  question, this guy said that he hopes the Senators ask these questions of John Roberts.&nbsp; Here’s one: “Are you 
  going to say that because the pope says this, or the church says that, you will 
  do it no matter what?”&nbsp; Who said that?&nbsp; Mario Cuomo!&nbsp; He’s one of MINE, he’s a 
  Catholic and he’s the one saying this.&nbsp;Right?</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here’s another guy:&nbsp; “If Roberts is confirmed, there will be quite a block 
  of Catholics on the court.&nbsp; Scalia, Kennedy and Thomas are strong in the 
  faith.&nbsp; Is it kosher to mention these things?” Well, it is if you’re 
  Christopher Hitchens, that atheist, anti-Catholic bigot.&nbsp; Of course he would 
  mention it.&nbsp; That’s where it's coming from.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how about Nina Totenberg out of National Public Radio.&nbsp; This is a great 
  one, listen to this one people, I couldn’t even make this up:&nbsp; “Don’t forget, 
  his wife was an officer, a high officer, in a pro-life organization.&nbsp; He’s got
  <i>adopted</i> children, and I mean he’s a conservative Catholic.” So this is what you’ve got 
  here people.&nbsp; The people who want to raise the bar so high that we can’t jump 
  over it, they’re not coming from the evangelical ranks, I know that.&nbsp; We’re on 
  the same side.&nbsp; It’s coming from these people who are on the Left, many of 
  them are secularists, some of them are maybe people of faith, I’m not going to 
  question that.&nbsp; All I’m simply saying is that I don’t have anything in common 
  with them, I have something in common with <i>you</i>. No, those are the people who are 
  my family. (applause)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, the Left is gettin' nervous, you know why?&nbsp; I got news for them.&nbsp; 
  Remember that song by Bob Dylan that goes like this - “the times they are a changing?” 
  They are changing, and the vector of change is moving our way, it’s not going 
  their way any longer.&nbsp;  </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you an example here of what I’m talking about. Think of it 
  [as a] metaphor – the culture is like several roads and that we’re 
  all on a big bus.&nbsp; Well we know who’s been driving the bus – it hasn’t been 
  us.&nbsp; Matter of fact, the Left who’s been driving the bus, they’re so 
  sweet they allow us to sit in the back of the bus, that’s how tolerant they 
  are.&nbsp;Right? Now they’ve been driving this bus down the wrong road for a long time.&nbsp; 
  Now I’m saying to you people it’s time that we move to the front of the 
  bus <i>and that we took command of the wheel</i>.&nbsp; <i>That’s what I want to see</i>.&nbsp; 
  (applause)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m tired of being told that somehow if you have a religious informed 
  conscience, that somehow you’re a second class citizen, you know, leave the driving to 
  these guys.&nbsp; We’ve seen what they’ve done and as far as I’m concerned, if 
  we’re going to make some progress in the country we're goin' to have to discover what our 
  roots are.&nbsp; We’re not imposing any kind of a strict construction idea where 
  everybody has to go off to church on Sunday.&nbsp; I mean they make it sound like 
  as if we’re the theocrats.&nbsp;&nbsp; All we are are decent people who simply say this:&nbsp; 
  that religion 
  is a focal point in our lives.&nbsp; Ninety-four percent of the American people believe in God, 
  85% in this country are Christians.&nbsp; It’s not a matter of  shoving 
  our ideas down somebody’s throat.&nbsp; It’s a matter of us saying that we want to 
  stand up and we want to be counted and we’re tired of being second class 
  citizens to these people and we’re not going to take it any longer.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;<p align="justify">(Standing ovation) </p>
