<title>Benny Hinn Threatens Lawsuit</title>

  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Benny Hinn Threatens Lawsuit</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Benny Hinn, through his attorney, has demanded as of 19 Dec 2003 that all 
  criticism of him be removed immediately from this website, claiming that he is 
  being defamed.&nbsp; Here are the pages in question:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="benny_hinn_fire.html">Benny Hinn Prophesies That God's 
    Glory&nbsp;Will Visibly Appear as Fire in the Sky!</a></b></li>
    <li><b><font color="#ff0000"><a href="Benny-Hinn-Mass.html">Is Benny Hinn 
    Teaching The Real Presence Of The Catholic Mass?</a></font></b></li>
    <li><b>
    <a href="benny_hinn_sets_prophetic_dates.html">Benny Hinn's Prophesies For 
    2003 Fail!</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="tbn.html">Will Jesus Appear <i>
    Physically</i> At Benny Hinn Crusades?</a></b></li>
    <li><b><a href="Hinn-Dead-Raised.html">The Dead 
    Resurrected By TVs Tuned To TBN!</a></b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>My understanding is that defamation (libel / 
  slander) involves knowingly telling falsehoods about someone else. That is <u>
  not</u> a practice I engage in. I maintain that the information in the above 
  pages is well documented, true, and justly criticizes Benny Hinn and his 
  ministry, and is protected under the constitution of the United States as 
  freedom of speech, and freedom of the press.&nbsp; Benny Hinn needs to admit 
  that he has prophesied falsely, without any word from God, and repent, and not 
  attempt to muzzle his critics by threatening lawsuits. Imagine the opportunity 
  this would present to publicly prove in a court of law that Benny Hinn's 
  prophecies have failed repeatedly! Is he really contemplating contesting this 
  documented fact?</p>
  <p>Benny Hinn is also making a totally false accusation against me. He is 
  (through his attorney) accusing me of redirecting traffic from a web site of 
  his to my web site. In other words, the accusation is that people trying to go 
  to a Benny Hinn web site are deceptively sent to my site, and that I am 
  responsible for this deceptive redirection, although I have <u>not</u> been 
  told by the attorney where this was allegedly done. I have informed Hinn's 
  attorney that he is misinformed, and that I have not done any such thing. 
  Again, that is <u>not</u> a practice I engage in. I 
  would not even contemplate such deception, and do not know who has done it.</p>
  <p>Hinn's attorney gave me a maximum of 75 minutes, 
  from the time the email was sent, to respond to his demands or face injunctive 
  legal action. I did not even receive the email until the time had expired, so 
  I guess we will see if Hinn's attorney was bluffing or not. &nbsp;&#8213;
