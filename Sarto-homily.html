      <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><u><b>Does the pope speak?<br>
      It is Jesus Christ who is speaking!</b></u></font></p>
      <hr>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">
        <img border="0" src="Sarto.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" width="280" height="490">&quot;The Pope is not simply 
        the representative of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, he is Jesus Christ 
        Himself, under the veil of the flesh, and who by means of a being common 
        to humanity continues His ministry amongst men ... Does the Pope speak? 
        It is Jesus Christ Who is speaking. Does he teach? It is Jesus Christ 
        Who teaches. Does he confer grace or pronounce an anathema? It is Jesus 
        Christ Himself Who is pronouncing the anathema and conferring the grace. 
        Hence consequently, when one speaks of the Pope, it is not necessary to 
        examine, but to obey: there must be no limiting the bounds of the 
        command, in order to suit the purpose of the individual whose obedience 
        is demanded: there must be no cavilling at the declared will of the 
        Pope, and so invest it with quite another than that which he has put 
        upon it: no preconceived opinions must be brought to bear upon it: no 
        rights must be set up against the rights of the Holy Father&nbsp; to 
        teach and command; his decisions are not to be criticized, or his 
        ordinances disputed. Therefore by Divine ordination, all, no matter how 
        august the person may be — whether he wear a crown or be invested with 
        the purple, or be clothed in the sacred vestments: all must be subject 
        to Him Who has had all things put under Him.&quot;  </font></p>

  <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Frequently quoted, 
  this blasphemous claim is attributed to the inaugural sermon (given in St. 
  Mark's) of Cardinal Giuseppe Melchior Sarto, Patriarch of Venice (1893-1903). 
  His elevation to Cardinal and Patriarch, in June of 1893 by Pope Leo XIII, was 
  contested and delayed for 18 months by the Italian government, who claimed the 
  right of exequatur, but withheld their approval. (</font>See <i>Evangelical 
  Christendom</i>, Vol. 48, May 1, 1894, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3XwAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22Evangelical+Christendom%22+Exequatur+Patriarch+Venice&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22Evangelical%20Christendom%22%20Exequatur%20Patriarch%20Venice&f=false">pg. 142</a>.) <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">During that time, Cardinal Sarto was even denied entry into the city 
  of Venice. King Humbert finally relented September 5th of 1894, giving his 
  assent to the appointment. In his first pastoral letter to the Venetians, 
  Cardinal Sarto then wrote:</font></p>
  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman">&quot;Harmony between the different 
  social classes must be re-established; peace must reign on earth. This is the 
  task I intend to perform for you; this is the duty I promise to fulfil that 
  all may once again be subject to the dominion of God, Jesus Christ and His 
  Vicar on earth.&quot;</font></p>

  <p align="justify">Dal-Gal continues:</p>
      <blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&quot;On the afternoon of November 24th 1894, a steamboat of the 
  Royal Marine carried Cardinal Sarto over the peaceful waters of the Grand 
  Canal, stopping in the close vicinity of the Golden Cathedral of St. Mark. All 
  the bells of the city announced the joy and triumph of the multitudinous 
  throngs lining the canals and crowding at the windows of the palaces. They 
  waved their white flags beneath the rich marble balconies and shouted a 
  prolonged chorus of jubilation as the Cardinal in his scarlet robes passed by, 
  blessing them as a father does his children. ... Midst such festivity, 
  flourish and magnificence did the humble Patriarch enter the city of the 
  Doges; ... [pg. 107] Cardinal Sarto's first real meeting with the Venetians 
  took place the following morning when he celebrated Solemn High Mass in the 
  Cathedral of St. Mark and addressed his first words to them from the pulpit. 
  The Cathedral was brilliantly illuminated, and a huge crowd of people hastened 
  to take a closer glance at their new Patriarch and listen to his words.&quot;</p>

      </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As first reported by <i>
  Evangelical Christendom</i>, the Cardinal's homily was, in context, boldly 
  asserting the Pope to be the sole authority to appoint the Princes of the 
  Roman Catholic Church. Cardinal Sarto later became Pope Pius X (1903-1914). 
  His sermon was also cited in:</font></p>

      1896, The Catholic Truth Society of London </font></span><font size="3">published a booklet 
      by Rev. 
  Sydney F. Smith S. J. titled <i>Does The Pope Claim To Be God. </i>On
  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NIkQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false">pages 10 and 11</a> it reveals that Cardinal Sarto was queried 
  about the alleged homily, and that he gave the following reply in a letter 
      written sometime before Jan. 10, 1896:</font></span></h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;... I have read all the homilies I 
    have made since my coming here in Venice, and only in the sermon for the 
    anniversary of the election of the Holy Father, I said these exact words: 'The Pope represents Jesus Christ Himself, 
    and therefore is a loving father. The life of the Pope is a holocaust of 
    love for the human family. His word is love. Love, his weapons; love, the 
    answer he gives to all who hate him; love, his flag, —i.e., the Cross, which 
    signed the greatest triumph on earth and in heaven.' ... &amp;c.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">
  The Pope at the time, Leo XIII, was elected on February 20th, 1878, so the 
  date referred to by Cardinal Sarto for his homily celebrating the Pope's 
  anniversary would have been on or about 
  February 20th of 1895, while the blasphemous homily attributed to him was 
  given at the first Mass he celebrated in St. Mark's, which was on 
  Sunday November 25th, 1894, some three months earlier. <i>Note that the above article 
  in Evangelical Christendom was already in print and on the street some two 
  months <u>before</u> Cardinal Sarto gave the sermon he offers as the genuine 
  one!</i>&nbsp; I find that very curious indeed. </p>
  <p align="justify">
  Clearly when Cardinal Sarto was contemplating his reply, he was not aware of 
  the <i>Evangelical Christendom</i> article of January 1st, 1895, that 
  essentially pinpointed the homily as the one he gave the day after he had so triumphantly 
  entered the city of Venice as its new Patriarch, a mere five weeks earlier. And who would need to check their records in order to 
  ascertain if they had ever given such a sermon and made such claims? I would 
  suggest that rather than being a credible denial, Cardinal Sarto (Pius X) 
  offered an evasive and inadequate reply that does not exonerate him, rather it 
  tends to support the reported blasphemous homily as being <i>completely</i> 
  genuine.</p>
  <p align="justify">
  A new and revised edition of Rev. Smith's booklet titled <i>Does The Pope 
  Claim To Be Divine?</i> published in 1929 makes no mention of, or defense of, 
  Cardinal Sarto's homily. Very curious indeed.</p>
