  <p>The following email was sent to Daniel at <b><i><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/home/protestantchallenges/">A Biblical Case for 
  the Catholic Faith</a> </i></b>on April 8, 2007:</p>
  
        <blockquote>
          <p>Gal 1:6&nbsp; I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called 
          you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
          Gal 1:7&nbsp; Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and 
          would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
          Gal 1:8&nbsp; But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other 
          gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be 
          accursed (anathema).<br>
          Gal 1:9&nbsp; As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any 
          other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed 
          (anathema).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That tells me to test what is taught by what Paul taught. Now, 
        outside of scripture, where exactly does Catholic Apostolic Tradition 
        quote the unwritten words of any of Paul's teaching? <br>
        <br>
        Where does Paul teach that Mary was immaculately conceived?<br>
        Where does Paul teach that Mary was assumed into heaven?<br>
        Where does Paul teach prayer to Mary or other supposed saints?<br>
        Where does Paul teach Mary is the mediatrix of all grace?<br>
        Where does Paul teach the veneration of images?<br>
        Where does Paul teach Sunday keeping has replaced the Sabbath?<br>
        <br>
        Can you show me any of these doctrines in Paul's word-for-word teaching 
        that is found only in Catholic Apostolic Oral Tradition and not in the 
        Bible? Yes or No? If no, then you would automatically agree that all of 
        Paul's gospel can only be found in inspired scripture, and Paul's gospel in 
        scripture is the ruler by which Catholic Tradition can be judged. Right? 
        Would Paul accept those Catholic doctrines or curse them?<br>
        <br>
        Your reply, if any, will be considered as an open letter with your 
        permission that I may post it on my web site, unless you specifically

<p align="left">Paul is quite 
firm in his assertion that not even an angel from heaven can teach a gospel message that 
differs from the one he preached. I am simply asking you where in Roman Catholic 
Tradition is Paul's preaching of those particular doctrines to be found? The first 
two, the immaculate conception and the assumption of Mary are considered 
infallible papal decrees that all Catholics are bound to believe or they are 
shipwrecked and fallen completely away from the faith. In other words, they are 
infallibly declared a part of the Catholic gospel, as a Catholic who rejects 
those doctrines cannot be saved. Now where exactly does Paul teach this?</p>

<p align="left">Paul's assertion in Galatians 1:6-9 is certainly biblical, and he 
said he did preach the <i>entire</i> gospel:</p>
  <blockquote>

Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have

          the Holy Spirit (the Third Person of the Trinity). Both of these ideas 
          are UNBiblical. It is good and healthy and wise to pray to Jesus but 
          the origin of this idea comes from Apostolic Tradition or the

  <p>In the Old Testament the pre-incarnate Son of God, Jesus Christ, is 
  referred to as Jehovah (H3068). In the following verses, the LORD is the 
  translation for the word Jehovah.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Num 21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for 
  we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he 
  take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. [It was Jesus 
  who met with Moses on mount Sinai.]</p>
  <p>1 Sam 7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for 
  you unto the LORD.</p>
  <p>Jer 42:4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; 
  behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it 
  shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will 
  declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I conclude that it is biblical to pray to the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah, 
  as well as to God the Father, as Jesus did. However, you will not find anyone 
  in scripture teaching or practicing prayer to anyone but God. Prayer to Mary 
  or other dead saints is not taught anywhere in scripture.</p>

  the Catholic gospel is only available with the addition of apostolic 
  Tradition, which by its own definition is <i>not found in scripture</i>. So 
  the question I am posing is this: please cite in Catholic Tradition where Paul

        <i>It is impossible for the conclusion of a valid argument to be false 
        while its premises are true. </i></p>
        <p>A. All boys are human. <br>
        B. Billy is a boy. <br>
        C. <u>Therefore Billy is human. </u></p>
        <p>The premises in this case are true, therefore Billy is human. <br>

        <p>And likewise: </p>
        <p>A. In the first millennium, there was but one Christian Faith.<br>
        B. The apostles lived in the first millennium. <br>
        C. <u><b>Therefore the faith of the first millennium, was the faith of 
        the apostles </b></u>(and therefore that of the Holy Bible). </p>
        <p>The Faith of the 1st millennium was the Catholic or Universal Faith 
        (Catholic or Katholikos in Greek) Faith. All Bible Believing Christians 
        should &quot;Test” premise A as the Holy Bible commands: </p>
        <p align="center"><b>“Test everything. Hold on to the good. Avoid every 
        kind of evil.”<br>
&nbsp;1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 </b></p>
        <p>Test premise A. If one cannot find any of the Protestant theologies 
        predating the renaissance era, nor even the 10th century, why would one 
        erroneously assume the Apostles taught these ideas in the 1st century? 
        No Protestant idea was taught in the first 1000+ years of Christianity. 
        No Protestant idea was taught before the renaissance era. For the 
        invention of Protestantism and the Protestant belief system was born in 
        the middle if not the latter half of the second millennium. 1000+ years 
        after the Apostles wrote the Holy Bible. One can not find a single 
        Christian who taught Protestant ideas or embraced the Protestant belief 
        system in any shape or form.</td>

  <p>The Protestant Reformation was fueled by the availability of the Bible in 
  the vernacular, when people could read what it had to say for themselves. In 
  doing so they could see that much of what they had been taught was not only 
  not found in scripture, but was flatly contradicted by scripture. </p>
  <p>The Protestant motto <i>Sola Scriptura</i> does not promote &quot;new&quot; 
  doctrines, it proclaims a return to the pure doctrinal teaching of the 
  Apostles as found in the Bible, and rejects the novel unbiblical Traditions of 
  the Catholic Church, just as Jesus rejected the Traditions of the scribes and 
  Pharisees. To be sure, however, many Protestants still hold to and teach 
  Catholic Traditions that are contrary to the Sola Scriptura principle (like 
  Sunday keeping replacing the Sabbath). For this they can rightly be 
  criticized as not really teaching or following the &quot;Bible Only&quot;.</p>
