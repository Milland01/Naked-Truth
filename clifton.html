  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p align="center">[pg. 3]</p>
  <p>I am going to propose a very plain and serious question, to which I would 
  entreat all who profess to follow &quot;the Bible and the Bible only&quot; to give their 
  most earnest attention. It is this: Why do you not keep holy the Sabbath-day?</p>
  <p>The command of Almighty God stands clearly written in the Bible in these 
  words: &quot;Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, 
  and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; 
  in it thou shalt do any work&quot; (Exod. xx. 8,9) And again, &quot;Six days shall work 
  be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a Sabbath 
  of rest to the Lord; whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. Ye 
  shall kindle no fire through out your habitations upon the Sabbath day&quot; (Exod. 
  xxxv. 2, 3). How strict and precise is</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 4]</p>
  <p>God's commandment upon this head! No work whatever was to be done on the 
  day which He had chosen to set apart for Himself and to make holy; He required 
  of His people that they should not even light a fire upon that day. And 
  accordingly, when the children of Israel &quot;found a man that gathered sticks 
  upon the Sabbath-day,&quot; &quot;the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put 
  to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp&quot; 
  (Numbers xv. 35). Such being God's command then, I ask you again, Why do you 
  not obey it? Why do you not keep holy the Sabbath-day?</p>
  <p>You will answer me, perhaps, that you <em>do</em> keep holy the Sabbath 
  day; for that you abstain from all the worldly business and diligently go to 
  church, and say your prayers, and read your Bible at home, every Sunday of 
  your lives.</p>
  <p>But <em>Sunday is not the Sabbath-day.</em> Sunday is the <em>first</em> 
  day of the week; the Sabbath-day was the <em>seventh</em> day of the week. 
  Almighty God did not give a commandment that men should keep holy <em>one day 
  in seven;</em> but He named His own day, and said distinctly, &quot;Thou shalt keep 
  holy the <em>seventh day;</em>&quot; and he assigned</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 5]</p>
  <p>a reason for choosing this day rather than any other - a reason which 
  belongs only to the seventh day of the week, and cannot be applied to the 
  rest. He says, &quot;For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, the 
  sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; <em>wherefore</em> 
  the Lord blessed the Sabbath-day and hallowed it.&quot; Almighty God ordered that 
  all men should rest from their labor on the seventh day, because He too had 
  rested on that day: He did not rest on Sunday, but on Saturday. On Sunday, 
  which is the first day of the week, He <em>began</em> the work of creation. He 
  did not finish it; it was on Saturday that He &quot;<em>ended</em> His work which 
  He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had 
  made; and God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it, because that in it 
  He had rested from all His work which God created and made&quot; (Gen. ii. 2, 3) 
  Nothing can more plain and easy to understand than all this; and there is 
  nobody who attempts to deny it; it is acknowledged by everybody that the day 
  which Almighty God appointed to be kept holy was Saturday, not Sunday. Why do 
  you then keep holy the Sunday, and not Saturday?</p>
  <p>You will tell me that Saturday was the <em>Jewish</em></p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 6]</p>
  <p>Sabbath, but that the <em>Christian</em> Sabbath has been changed to 
  Sunday. Changed! but by whom? Who has the authority to change an express 
  commandment of God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy the 
  seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and do all manner of 
  worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt keep holy the first day in 
  its stead? This is a most important question, which I know not how you can 
  answer.</p>
  <p>You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the Bible 
  only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day in seven 
  as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put another 
  day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded. The command to 
  keep holy the seventh day is one of the ten commandments; you believe that the 
  other nine are still binding; who gave you authority to tamper with the 
  fourth? If you are consistent with your own principles, if you really follow 
  the Bible and the Bible only, you ought to be able to produce some portion of 
  the New Testament in which this fourth commandment is expressly altered, or at 
  least from which you may confidently</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 7]</p>
  <p>infer that it was the will of God that Christians should make that change 
  in its observance which you have made. Let us see whether any such passages 
  can be found. I will look for them in the writings of your own champions, who 
  have attempted to defend your practice in this matter.</p>
  <p>1. The first text which I find quoted upon the subject is this: &quot;Let no man 
  judge you in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the 
  Sabbath-days&quot; (Col. ii. 16). I could understand a Bible Christian arguing from 
  this passage, that we ought to make no difference between Saturday, Sunday, 
  and every other day of the week; that under the Christian dispensation all 
  such distinctions of days were done away with; one day was as good and as holy 
  as another; there were to be no Sabbaths, no holy days at all. But not one 
  syllable does it say about the obligation of the Sabbath being <em>transferred</em> 
  from one day to another.</p>
  <p>2. Secondly, the words of St. John are quoted, &quot;I was in the Spirit on the 
  Lord's day (Apoc. i. 10). Is it possible that anybody can for a moment imagine 
  that here is a safe and clear rule for changing the weekly feast from the 
  seventh to the first day? This</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 8]</p>
  <p>passage is utterly silent upon such a subject; it does but give us 
  Scriptural authority for calling some one day in particular (it does not even 
  say <em>which</em> day) &quot;the Lord's day.&quot;</p>
  <p>3. Next we are reminded that St. Paul bade his Corinthian converts, &quot;upon 
  the first day of the week, lay by them in store, that there might be no 
  gatherings&quot; when he himself came (1 Cor. xvi. 2). How is this supposed to 
  affect the law of the Jewish Sabbath? It commands a certain act of almsgiving 
  to be done on the first day of the week. It says absolutely nothing about not 
  doing certain other acts of prayer and public worship on the seventh day.</p>
  <p>4. But it was &quot;on the first day of the week&quot; when the disciples were 
  assembled with closed doors for fear of the Jews, and Jesus stood in the midst 
  of them; and again, it was eight days afterwards (that is, on the first day of 
  the following week) that &quot;the disciples were within, and Thomas with them,&quot; 
  and Jesus again came and stood in the midst (John xx. 19, 26): that is to say, 
  it was on the evening of the day of the Resurrection that our Lord first 
  showed Himself to many disciples gathered together; and after eight days He 
  again showed Himself to the same company, with the further addition</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 9]</p>
  <p>of St. Thomas. What is there in these facts to do away with the obligation 
  of keeping holy the seventh day? Our Lord rose from dead on the first day of 
  the week, and on the same day at evening He appears to many of His disciples; 
  He appears again on that day [of the] week, and perhaps also on other days in 
  the interval. Let Protestants, if they will, keep holy the first day of the 
  week in grateful commemoration of that stupendous mystery, the Resurrection of 
  Christ, and of the evidence He vouchsafed to give of it to His doubting 
  disciples; but this is no scriptural authority for ceasing to keep holy 
  another day of the week which God had expressly commanded to be kept holy for 
  another and altogether different reason.</p>
  <p>5. But lastly, we have the example of the Apostles themselves. &quot;Upon the 
  first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul 
  preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech 
  until midnight&quot; (Acts xx. 7). Here we have clear proof that the disciples came 
  together for the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, and that they heard a 
  sermon on a Sunday. But is there any proof that they had not done the</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 10]</p>
  <p>same on Saturday also? Is it not expressly written concerning those same 
  early Christians, that they &quot;continued <em>daily</em> with one accord in the 
  temple, breaking bread from house to house?&quot; (Acts ii. 46). And as a matter of 
  fact, do we not know from other sources that, in many parts of the Church, the 
  ancient Christians were in the habit of meeting together for public worship, 
  to receive Holy Communion, and to perform the other offices, on Saturdays just 
  the same as on Sundays? Again, then, I say, let Protestants keep holy, if they 
  will, the first day of the week, in order that they may resemble those 
  Christians who were gathered together on that day in the upper chamber in 
  Troas; but let them remember that this cannot possibly release them from the 
  obligation of keeping holy <em>another</em> day which Almighty God has ordered 
  to be kept holy, because on that day He &quot;rested from all His work&quot;.</p>
  <p>I do not know of any other passages of holy Scripture which Protestants are 
  in the habit of quoting to defend their practice of keeping holy the first day 
  of the week instead of the seventh; yet surely those which I have quoted are 
  not such as should satisfy any reasonable man, who looks upon the written word 
  of God as <em>they</em></p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 11]</p>
  <p>profess to look upon it, namely as the <em>one only</em> appointed means of 
  learning God's will, and who really desires to learn and to obey that will in 
  all things with humbleness and simplicity of heart. It is absolutely 
  impossible that a reasonable and thoughtful person should be satisfied, by the 
  texts that I have quoted, that the almighty God intended the obligation of 
  Saturday under the old law to be transferred to Sunday under the new. And yet 
  Protestants do so transfer it, and never seem to have the slightest misgivings 
  lest, in doing so, they should be guilty of breaking one of God's 
  commandments. Why is this? Because, although they talk so largely about 
  following the Bible and the Bible only, they are really guided in this matter 
  by the voice of tradition. Yes, as much as they may have in fact no other 
  authority to allege for this most important change. The present generation of 
  Protestants keep Sunday holy instead of Saturday, because they received it as 
  part of the Christian religion from the last generation, and that generation 
  received it from the generation before, and so on backwards from one 
  generation to another, by a continual succession, until we come to the time of 
  the</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 12]</p>
  <p>(so called) Reformation, when it so happened that those who conducted the 
  change of religion in this country left this particular portion of Catholic 
  faith, and practice untouched.</p>
  <p>But, had it happened otherwise, - had some one or other of the &quot;Reformers&quot; 
  taken it into his head to denounce the observance of Sunday as a Popish 
  corruption and superstition, and to insist upon it that Saturday was the day 
  which God had appointed to be kept holy, and that He had never authorized the 
  observance of any other - all Protestants would have been obliged in obedience 
  to their professed principle of following the Bible and the Bible only, either 
  to acknowledge this teaching as true, and to return to the observance of 
  ancient Jewish Sabbath, or else to deny that there is any Sabbath at all. And 
  so, in like manner, any one at the present day who should be set about, 
  honestly and without prejudice, to draw up for himself a form of religious 
  belief and practice our of the written word of God, must needs come to the 
  same conclusion: he must either believe that the Jewish Sabbath is still 
  binding upon men's consciences, because of the Divine command, &quot;Thou shalt 
  keep holy the seventh day;&quot; or he must believe that no Sabbath at</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 13]</p>
  <p>all is binding upon them, because of the Apostolic injunction, &quot;Let no man 
  judge you in respect of a festival day, or of the Sabbaths, which are a shadow 
  of things to come, but the body is Christ's.&quot; Either one or the other of these 
  conclusions he might honestly come to; but he would know nothing whatever of a
  <em>Christian</em> Sabbath distinct from the Jewish, celebrated on a different 
  day, and observed in a different manner, simply because Holy Scripture itself 
  nowhere speaks of such a thing.</p>
  <p>Now, mind in all this you would greatly misunderstand me if you supposed I 
  was quarreling with you for acting in this matter on the true and right 
  principle, in other words, a Catholic principle, viz., the acceptance, without 
  hesitation, of that which has been handed down to you by an unbroken 
  tradition. I would not tear from you a single one of those shreds and 
  fragments of Divine truth which you have retained. God forbid! They are the 
  most precious things you possess, and by God's blessing may serve as clues to 
  bring you out of that labyrinth of error in which you find yourselves 
  involved, far more by the fault of your forefathers three centuries ago than 
  by your own. What do I quarrel with you for is, not your inconsistency</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 14]</p>
  <p>in occasionally acting on a true principle, but your adoption, as a general 
  rule, of a false one. You keep the Sunday, and not the Saturday; and you do so 
  rightly, for this was the practice of all Christians when Protestantism began; 
  but you have abandoned other Catholic observances which were equally universal 
  at that day, preferring the novelties introduced by the men who invented 
  Protestantism, to the unvarying tradition of above 1500 years. We blame you 
  not for making Sunday your weekly holyday instead of Saturday, but for 
  rejecting tradition, which is the only safe and clear rule by which this 
  observance can be justified. In outward act we do the same as yourselves in 
  this matter; we too no longer observe the Jewish Sabbath, but Sunday in its 
  stead; but then there is this important difference between us, that we do not 
  pretend, as you do, to derive our authority for so doing from a <em>book</em>, 
  but we derive it from a <em>living teacher</em>, and that teacher is the 
  Church. Moreover, we believe that not every thing which God would have us to 
  know and to do is written in the Bible, but that is also an unwritten word of 
  God, which we are bound to believe and to obey, just as we believe and obey 
  the Bible itself, according to that saying</p>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>[pg. 15]</p>
  <p>of the Apostles, &quot;Stand fast and hold the traditions which you have 
  learned, <em>whether by word or by our epistle&quot;</em> (2 Thess. ii 14). We 
  Catholics, then, have precisely the same authority for keeping Sunday holy 
  instead of Saturday as we have for every other article of our creed, namely, 
  the authority of &quot;the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of 
  truth&quot; (1 Tim. iii 15); whereas you who are Protestants have really no 
  authority for it whatever; for there <em>is</em> no authority for it in the 
  Bible, and you will not allow that there <em>can be</em> authority for it 
  anywhere else. Both you and we do, in fact, follow tradition in this matter; 
  but <em>we</em> follow it, believing it to be a part of God's word, and the 
  Church to be its divinely-appointed guardian and interpreter; you follow it, 
  denouncing it all the time as a fallible and treacherous guide, which often 
  &quot;make the commandment of God of none effect.&quot;</p>
