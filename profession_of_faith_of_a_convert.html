<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Note that the following profession of faith, intended for 
  Protestant converts to Catholicism and published early in the 20th century, 
  has a strong emphasis on obedience to presumed Roman ecclesiastical authority, 
  and claims that salvation comes through sacraments administered by the Church, 
  but actually says <i>nothing</i> about repenting of sin, or professing a 
  saving faith in Jesus Christ's atoning death for those sins.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, ........., having before my eyes the 
    holy Gospels, which I touch with my hands, and knowing that no one can be 
    saved without that Faith which the Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church 
    holds, believes, and teaches, against which I agree that I have greatly 
    erred, in as much as I have held and believed doctrines opposed to her 
    teaching.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now, with grief and contrition for my past errors, profess 
    that I believe the Holy, Catholic, Apostolic, Roman Church to be the only 
    and true Church established on earth by Jesus Christ, to which I submit 
    myself with my whole heart. I believe all the articles that she proposes to 
    my belief, and I reject and condemn all that she rejects and condemns, and I 
    am ready to observe all that she commands me. And especially I profess that 
    I believe: One only God in three divine Persons, distinct from and equal to 
    each other,<font face="Times New Roman">—that is to say, the Father, the 
    Son, and the Holy Ghost: The Catholic Doctrine of the Incarnation, Passion, 
    Death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ; and the personal union of 
    the two Natures, the divine and the human; the divine Maternity of the most 
    holy Mary, together with her most spotless Virginity;<br>
    </font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">The true, real and 
    substantial presence of the body and blood, together with the Soul and 
    Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the most holy Sacrament of the 
    Eucharist; [pg. 102]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seven Sacraments instituted by Jesus Christ for the 
    salvation of mankind; that is to say, Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, 
    Penance, Extreme Unction, Order, Matrimony;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purgatory, the Resurrection of the dead, Everlasting life;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Primacy, not only of honor, but also of jurisdiction of 
    the Roman Pontiff, successor of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, Vicar of 
    Jesus Christ; the veneration of the Saints and of their images; The 
    authority of the Apostolic and Ecclesiastical traditions, and of the Holy 
    Scriptures, which we must interpret and understand only in the same sense 
    which our holy Mother the Catholic Church has held and does hold; And 
    everything else that has been defined and declared by the Sacred Canons and 
    by the General Councils, and particularly by the Holy Council of Trent, and 
    delivered, defined and declared by the General Council of the Vatican, 
    especially concerning the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff and his Infallible 
    teaching authority.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a sincere heart, therefore, and with unfeigned faith, I 
    detest and abjure every error, heresy and sect opposed to the said Holy 
    Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church. So help me God and these Gospels, which 
    I touch with my hand.</font></p>
