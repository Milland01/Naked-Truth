<title>A Mistranslation of Dies Domini in English</title>
</head>

<body>

<blockquote>
  <b>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">Dies Domini Mistranslated in English.</font></b></p>
  <hr size="4" width="100%">
  <p>I would like to call attention to an apparently significant mistranslation
  in the Vatican's English version of Dies Domini. As posted to the Vatican web
  site, paragraph #14 is translated as:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>14. In the first place, therefore, Sunday is the day of rest because it
    is the day &quot;blessed&quot; by God and &quot;made holy&quot; by him, set
    apart from the other days to be, among all of them, &quot;the Lord's
    Day&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Latin for this sentence on the Vatican web site is as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>14. <u><strong>Quietis</strong></u> itaque <u><strong>dies</strong></u>
    idcirco ante omnia talis est quod dies est a Deo « benedictus » ab Eoque
    « sanctificatus » scilicet ab aliis diebus segregatus ut inter omnes «
    dies sit Domini ».</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is important to note that the Latin word for Sunday, which is
  &quot;Dominica&quot;, is <i>not</i> used. The Latin text speaks of the
  &quot;dies quietis&quot;, referring to the &quot;day of rest&quot;, or sabbath
  day. In context, Pope John Paul II is speaking of the seventh-day sabbath
  (Saturday) being blessed, made holy and set apart by God, and not Sunday. This
  is clear also in the Vatican's German version, which reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>14. Der <u><strong>Tag der Ruhe ist der Sabbat</strong></u> also vor
    allem deshalb, weil er der von Gott »gesegnete« und »geheiligte« Tag ist,
    das heißt, getrennt von den anderen Tagen, um unter allen der Tag des Herrn
    zu sein.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the German word for Sunday, Sonntag, does not appear. Rather, the
  sentence reads &quot;the day of rest&quot; (Der Tag der Ruhe), and it even
  then uses &quot;Sabbat&quot; for clarification, referring to the Saturday
  Sabbath.</p>
  <p>Also in French, Italian, Spanish, Portugese and Polish, the wording does
  not specifically use the word for Sunday:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In French: (Sunday is Dimanche)</p>
    <p>14. Le <strong><u>jour du repos</u></strong> est donc tel, d'abord parce
    qu'il est le jour « béni » par Dieu et « sanctifié » par lui,
    autrement dit séparé des autres jours pour être, entre tous, le « jour
    du Seigneur »</p>
    <p>In Italian: (Sunday is Domenica)</p>
    <p>14. Il <strong><u>giorno del riposo</u></strong> è dunque tale
    innanzitutto perché è il giorno « benedetto » da Dio e da lui «
    santificato », ossia separato dagli altri giorni per essere, tra tutti, il
    « giorno del Signore ».</p>
    <p>In Spanish: (Sunday is Domingo)</p>
    <p>14. El <strong><u>día del descanso</u></strong> es tal ante todo porque
    es el día « bendecido » y « santificado » por Dios, o sea, separado de
    los otros días para ser, entre todos, el « día del Señor».</p>
    <p>In Portugese: (Sunday is Domingo)</p>
    <p>14. Portanto, o <strong><u>dia do repouso</u></strong> é tal
    primariamente porque é o dia « abençoado » por Deus e por Ele «
    santificado », isto é, separado dos demais dias para ser, de entre todos,
    o « dia do Senhor ».</p>
    <p>In Polish, the Pope's native tongue: (Sunday is niedziele)</p>
    <p>14. Tak wiec <strong><u>dzien odpoczynku</u></strong> zawdziecza swój
    charakter przede wszystkim temu, ze Bóg go « poblogoslawil » i «
    uswiecil », to znaczy oddzielil od pozostalych dni, aby byl posród nich «
    dniem Panskim ».</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In view of the above texts, which all read &quot;the day of rest&quot;, and
  do <i>not</i> use the word for Sunday, it is clear that a more accurate
  English translation of #14 from the Latin would read as follows (note the 
  context in which #14 appears):</p>
  <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;<b><i>God blessed <u>the seventh day</u> and made it holy</i></b>&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 
    2:3)</p>
    <p>13. The Sabbath precept, which in the first Covenant prepares for the 
    Sunday of the new and eternal Covenant, is therefore rooted in the depths of 
    God's plan. This is why, unlike many other precepts, it is set not within 
    the context of strictly cultic stipulations but within the Decalogue, the 
    &quot;ten words&quot; which represent the very pillars of the moral life inscribed on 
    the human heart. In setting this commandment within the context of the basic 
    structure of ethics, Israel and then the Church declare that they consider 
    it not just a matter of community religious discipline but <i>a defining and 
    indelible expression of our relationship with God</i>, announced and 
    expounded by biblical revelation. This is the perspective within which 
    Christians need to rediscover this precept today. Although the precept may 
    merge naturally with the human need for rest, it is faith alone which gives 
    access to its deeper meaning and ensures that it will not become banal and 
    trivialized.</p>
    <p>14. In the first place, therefore, the day of rest (the sabbath) is such
    because it is the day &quot;blessed&quot; by God and &quot;made holy&quot;
    by him, set apart from the other days to be, among all of them, &quot;the
    Lord's Day&quot;.</p>
    <p>In order to grasp fully what the first of the biblical creation accounts 
    means by keeping the Sabbath &quot;holy&quot;, we need to consider the whole story, 
    which shows clearly how every reality, without exception, must be referred 
    back to God. Time and space belong to him. He is not the God of one day 
    alone, but the God of all the days of humanity.</p>
    <p><u>Therefore, if God &quot;sanctifies&quot; the seventh day</u> with a special 
    blessing and makes it &quot;his day&quot; <i>par excellence</i>, this must be 
    understood within the deep dynamic of the dialogue of the Covenant, indeed 
    the dialogue of &quot;marriage&quot;. This is the dialogue of love which knows no 
    interruption, yet is never monotonous. In fact, it employs the different 
    registers of love, from the ordinary and indirect to those more intense, 
    which the words of Scripture and the witness of so many mystics do not 
    hesitate to describe in imagery drawn from the experience of married love</p>
  </blockquote>
  </font>
  <p>Consequently, Pope John Paul II clearly does <i>not</i> claim in <i>Dies
  Domini </i>section #14 that Sunday was explicitly declared &quot;blessed&quot;
  by God and &quot;made holy&quot; by Him (as was the Saturday Sabbath in
  Genesis 2:3). Rather, as is evident from the Latin, and all translations but 
  the English, the Pope is affirming that the original &quot;Lord's
  Day&quot; was indeed the seventh-day Saturday sabbath. According to the Pope, later in
  Dies Domini, the change to Sunday was made not by God Himself but by the
  Christian (Catholic) Church, based on an assumed authority:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>63. Christ came to accomplish a new &quot;exodus&quot;, to restore
    freedom to the oppressed. <b>He performed many healings on the Sabbath (cf.
    Mt 12:9-14 and parallels), certainly not to violate the Lord's Day,</b> but
    to reveal its full meaning: &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for
    the Sabbath&quot; (Mk 2:27). Opposing the excessively legalistic
    interpretation of some of his contemporaries, and developing the true
    meaning of the biblical Sabbath, Jesus, as &quot;Lord of the Sabbath&quot;
    (Mk 2:28), restores to the Sabbath observance its liberating character,
    carefully safeguarding the rights of God and the rights of man. This is why <b>Christians</b>,
    called as they are to proclaim the liberation won by the blood of Christ, <b>felt
    that they had the authority to transfer the meaning of the Sabbath to the
    day of the Resurrection.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the above says that Jesus did not violate <i>&quot;the Lord's
  Day&quot;</i> by healing on the Sabbath, clearly meaning the same day with
  both terms: Saturday. Pope John Paul II is acknowledging that the Saturday
  Sabbath was truely the original Lord's Day, and that Jesus is the Lord of that
  Sabbath.</p>
  <p>This point of view, that Saturday was &quot;the Lord's day&quot; can also
  be found in an old Catholic Catechism:</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>THE THIRD COMMANDMENT OF GOD.</strong></p>
  <p align="center">'Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day'</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><strong>1. What are we commanded by the Third Commandment?</strong></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Third Commandment we are commanded
    to sanctify the Lord's day by performing works of piety and abstaining from
    servile works.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>2. Which is the Lord's day?</strong></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Old Law it was the seventh day of
    the week, or the Sabbath-day (day of rest), in memory of God's resting on
    that day, after He had finished the work of Creation in six days. In the New
    Law it is the first day of the week, or the Sunday, in memory of the
    accomplishment of our Redemption, which is a new spiritual Creation (Gal.
    vi. 15).</p>
    <p align="left">Source: <em>A Complete Catechism of the Catholic Religion</em>,
    from the German of Joseph Deharbe, S.J., Sixth American Edition, published
    by Schwartz, Kirwin &amp; Fauss, 53 Park Place, New York, copyright 1912,
    1919, 1924, pages <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> 
    <a href="deharbe-186-187.gif"><b>186-187</b></a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So overall, considering sections #14 (properly translated), #63 cited
  above, and <em>Deharbe's Catechism</em>, Pope John Paul II is making the case
  that God had originally instituted the &quot;Lord's day&quot; on Saturday the
  seventh-day, and that the early Christian Church felt they had full apostolic
  authority from God to transfer the observance of this day of rest to Sunday.
  This makes&nbsp;Sunday the <em>new</em> &quot;Lord's day&quot; of rest, <em>not</em>
  by a direct decree of God, but <em>by decree of the Church based on an assumed
  authority</em>. The implication in #63 being that this transfer or
  &quot;exodus&quot; to Sunday has in the process &quot;liberated&quot; the
  Gentile Christian from the excessive Jewish legalisms associated with the
  Saturday Sabbath. Precisely how this transfer to Sunday sacredness was
  indicated or justified by Jesus' healing on the Sabbath is not clearly stated.</p>
  <p align="left">So let's examine in scripture which day the Lord claims <em>explicitly</em>
  to be his Holy day:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But <em><strong>the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God</strong></em>:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Isa 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from <strong><em>the
    sabbath</em></strong>, from doing thy pleasure <em><strong>on my holy day</strong></em>;
    and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt
    honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor
    speaking thine own words:<br>
    Isa 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee
    to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage
    of Jacob thy father: for <strong><em>the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</em></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Luke 6:5 And he [Jesus] said unto them, That <strong><em>the
    Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath</em></strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Lord God himself has declared the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) to be
  His holy day, and nowhere in the New Testament is this rescinded or transfered
  to Sunday by either Jesus or the Apostles.</p>
