<blockquote>
  <p>In the apocryphal book of Baruch, which is considered to be inspired 
  scripture by the Catholic Church, we find a very interesting description of 
  the pagan practices of the Babylonians, who at the time held the Jews in 
  captivity. While not considered a book of the Bible by Protestants, there is 
  no reason to doubt the accuracy of this historical account of Babylonian 
  idolatry in the 6th chapter of Baruch. The following scripture quotations are 
  taken from the Catholic Douay Rheims Bible:</p>

        causing fear to the Gentiles.<br>
        Baruch 6:4 Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, 
        and be afraid, and the fear of them should seize upon you.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is worth noting that Israel, by God's instructions, carried the Ark 
      of the Covenant in procession, which contained the Ten Commandments of God 
      written on tables of stone by God's own finger, which prohibited graven 
      images in very clear terms. In ironic contrast and bold apostasy, idols 
      are similarly carried in procession and venerated by Catholics, in open 
      and direct contradiction to God's explicit commandment law.</td>

    <p align="left">in medieval and modern Europe, day (May 1) for traditional 
    springtime celebrations, probably originating in pre-Christian agricultural 
    rituals. Though local usage varied widely, these celebrations commonly 
    included the carrying in procession of trees, green branches, or garlands; 
    the appointment of a May king and May queen; and the setting up of a May 
    tree or Maypole. Originally such rites were intended to ensure fertility to 
    the crops, and by extension to cattle and human beings, but in most cases 
    this significance was gradually lost, and the practices survived merely as 
    popular festivities.</p>

  <p>So, according to the 6th Chapter of Baruch, the ancient pagan Babylonians 
  crowned their statues with crowns of gold or silver, carried them in 
  procession on their shoulders, dressed them with regal clothing, and lit great 
  numbers of candles to these statues of gold, silver, stone and wood. Modern 
  Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, does exactly and precisely the same to 
  honor its statues of Mary, Jesus and what it calls Saints.</p>

    for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.<br>
    Psa 115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?<br>
    Psa 115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath 
    pleased.<br>
    Psa 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.<br>
    Psa 115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see 
    not:<br>
    Psa 115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell

    <p>Rev 9:20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues 
    yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship 
    devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: 
    which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p>
    <p>Rev 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the 
    great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the 
    hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.<br>
    Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
    fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, 
    and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
    delicacies.<br>
    Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my 
    people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her 
    plagues.<br>
    Rev 18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her 
    iniquities.</p>
