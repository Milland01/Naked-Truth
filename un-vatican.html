            S. CON. RES. 87</p>
            <p>Commending the Holy See for making significant contributions to
            international peace and human rights, and objecting to efforts to
            expel the Holy See from the United Nations by removing the Holy
            See's Permanent Observer status in the United Nations, and for other

            <p align="center">IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES<br>

            March 1, 2000</p>

            Mr. COVERDELL, and<br>
            Mr. BROWNBACK)</p>
            <p>submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred
            to the Committee on Foreign Relations</p>
            <p align="center">CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</p>
            <p>Commending the Holy See for making significant contributions to
            international peace and human rights, and objecting to efforts to
            expel the Holy See from the United Nations by removing the Holy
            See's Permanent Observer status in the United Nations, and for other
            purposes.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Holy See is the governing authority of the sovereign
            State of Vatican City;</p>
            <p>Whereas the Holy See has an internationally recognized legal
            personality, which allows it to enter into treaties as the juridical
            equal of a state and to send and receive diplomatic representatives;</p>
            <p>Whereas the diplomatic history of the Holy See began over 1,600
            years ago, during the 4th century A.D., and the Holy See currently
            has formal diplomatic relations with 169 nations, including the
            United States, and maintains 179 permanent diplomatic missions
            abroad;</p>
            <p>Whereas, although the Holy See was an active participant in a
            wide range of United Nations activities since 1946, and was eligible
            to become a member state of the United Nations, it chose instead to
            become a nonmember state with Permanent Observer status over 36
            years ago, in 1964;</p>
            <p>Whereas, unlike other geographically small countries such as
            Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, and Liechtenstein, the Holy See does not
            possess a vote in the General Assembly of the United Nations;</p>
            <p>Whereas, according to a July 1998 assessment by the United States
            Department of State, `(t)he United States values the Holy See's
            significant contributions to international peace and human rights';</p>
            <p>Whereas during the past year, certain organizations that oppose
            the views of the Holy See regarding abortion and the sanctity of
            human life have initiated an organized effort to pressure the United
            Nations to remove the Permanent Observer status of the Holy See; and</p>
            <p>Whereas the removal of the Holy See's Permanent Observer status
            would constitute an expulsion of the Holy See from the United
            Nations as a state participant: Now, therefore, be it</p>
            <p>Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring),
            That Congress</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>(1) commends the Holy See for its unique contributions to a
              thoughtful and robust dialogue in issues of international concern
              during its 36 years as a Permanent Observer at the United Nations;</p>
              <p>(2) strongly objects to any effort to expel the Holy See from
              the United Nations as a state participant by removing its status
              as a nonmember state Permanent Observer;</p>
              <p>(3) believes that any degradation of the status accorded to the
              Holy See at the United Nations would seriously damage the
              credibility of the United Nations by demonstrating that its rules
              of participation are manipulable for ideological reasons rather
              than being rooted in neutral principles and objective facts of
              sovereignty; and</p>
              <p>(4) contends that any degradation of the status of the Holy See
              will damage relations between the United States and the United
              Nations.</p>
