Council for Justice and Peace regarding a reform of the global economy.

<blockquote>
  <div align="left">This is an amazing document that claims the Vatican
"has no desire to be involved in the political activities of any
nation" and then proceeds to cite various popes to advocate one global
authority. Then at the end, it has the temerity to mention the biblical
account of the Tower of Babel:<br>
  <blockquote>"The spirit of Babel is the antithesis of the Spirit of
Pentecost (Acts 2:1-12), of God&#8217;s design for the whole of humanity:
that is, unity in truth. Only a spirit of concord that rises above
divisions and conflicts will allow humanity to be authentically one
family and to conceive of a new world with the creation of a world
public Authority at the service of the common good."<br>
  </blockquote>
  </div>
The spirit of Pentecost was unity in truth, in complete accord with the
will of God. The spirit of Babel opposes the will of God. The Vatican
suggests that the building of the Tower of Babel failed due to a
superficial sense of unity that could not overcome selfish factional
differences. This is NOT why it failed. They were attempting to ensure
their safety by building high enough that they could survive any future
flood that God might send in judgment. It was an act of rebellion. So
God took away their common language, giving them multiple tongues. The
result was confusion, the complete disintegration of unity, and the
abandonment of building the tower.<br>
  <br>
The Vatican, <a href="vatican.html">the apostate Mystery Babylon of
Bible prophecy</a>, is saying
that with a stronger sense of family and the common good, concentrating
power in one global authority can succeed, that a modern tower can be
built, overcoming the previous failure. It is also an act of rebellion
that the Bible says will not succeed:<br>
  <blockquote>Dan 2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry
clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall
not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.<br>
Dan 2:44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all
these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.<br>
