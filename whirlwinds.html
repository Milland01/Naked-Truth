<title>Hurricanes</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">Hurricanes, the Latter Days, and the 
  Judgments of a Holy God</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Along the gulf coast of the southern United States, one of the harder hit 
  businesses from hurricane Katrina was the casinos, because by law they were 
  required to be located on floating barges at the beach, which put them in the 
  most vulnerable location, subject to the powerful storm surges. The gulf coast 
  states relied to a great degree on the jobs and revenue the casinos generated, 
  so they are a high priority in rebuilding the hurricane shattered economy. </p>
  <p>New Orleans has rightly had the reputation of being &quot;sin city&quot;, and today, 
  October 7th, 2005, Mayor Ray Nagin proposed that the salvation of his city 
  from the destruction wrought by two hurricanes might be possible, by allowing 
  the gaming industry to convert the larger hotels in the downtown area into 
  casinos. Tourism is the lifeblood of the region, and the politicians seem 
  willing to permit or license nearly any vice in order to attract the tourist's 
  dollar. It is no coincidence that the destruction wrought across the gulf 
  coast has been described by some as &quot;apocalyptic&quot; or &quot;of biblical 
  proportions&quot;, no coincidence at all.</p>
  <p>In the following verses, the word translated &quot;whirlwind&quot; is defined in 
  Strong's Concordance as follows: H5591. ca'ar, sah'-ar; or (fem.) ce'arah, seh-aw-raw'; 
  from H5590; <font color="#FF0000">a hurricane</font>:--storm (-y), tempest, 
  whirlwind.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 23:18 [KJV] For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath 
    perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it?<br>
    Jer 23:19 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a 
    grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.<br>
    Jer 23:20 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, 
    and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye 
    shall consider it perfectly.</p>
    <p>Jer 25:32 [KJV] Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth 
    from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the 
    coasts of the earth.<br>
    Jer 25:33 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the 
    earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, 
    neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.</p>
    <p>Jer 30:23 [KJV] Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, 
    a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.<br>
    Jer 30:24 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done 
    it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days 
    ye shall consider it.</p>
    <p>Luke 21:25 [KJV] And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, 
    and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; 
    the sea and the waves roaring;<br>
    Luke 21:26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those 
    things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be 
    shaken.<br>
    Luke 21:27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with 
    power and great glory.<br>
    Luke 21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and 
    lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p>
    <p>Amos 4:6 [NIV] &quot;I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread 
    in every town, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<br>
    Amos 4:7 &quot;I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three 
    months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One 
    field had rain; another had none and dried up.<br>
    Amos 4:8 People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough 
    to drink, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<br>
    Amos 4:9 &quot;Many times I struck your gardens and vineyards, I struck them with 
    blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive trees, yet you have 
    not returned to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<br>
    Amos 4:10 &quot;I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young 
    men with the sword, along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils 
    with the stench of your camps, yet you have not returned to me,&quot; declares 
    the LORD.<br>
    Amos 4:11 &quot;I overthrew some of you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You 
    were like a burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned 
    to me,&quot; declares the LORD.<br>
    Amos 4:12 &quot;Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel, and because I 
    will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, O Israel.&quot;<br>
    Amos 4:13 He who forms the mountains, creates the wind, and reveals his 
    thoughts to man, he who turns dawn to darkness, and treads the high places 
    of the earth-- the LORD God Almighty is his name.</p>
    <p>Deu 4:30 [KJV] When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are 
    come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, 
    and shalt be obedient unto his voice;<br>
    Deu 4:31 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, 
    neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware 
    unto them.</p>
