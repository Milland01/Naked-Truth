  <b><font size="5">Megiddo / Omega Code 2</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I was wrong. In my review of Omega Code, I said &quot;it would be difficult to produce a more secularized (non-religious)
  movie about Bible prophecy&quot;. TBN may have done just that with Megiddo. If
  you were disappointed with Omega Code and it's lack of a gospel message of
  salvation through Jesus Christ, then prepare yourself for even more of the
  same with Megiddo.</p>
  <p align="left">Megiddo devotes much of its plot to developing the background
  of Stone Alexander (the Antichrist character). It begins with how Stone always hated his brother David
  Alexander, even as a child, because his mother died giving birth to him. Stone,
  under Satan's influence, even tried to
  murder his brother at three months by setting fire to the crib. Because of
  this act, the young Stone is sent to a military academy, where several scenes
  depict his training there over some 10 years.</p>
  <p align="left">As Stone receives his military training, his brother David
  enters politics, and as Stone becomes head of the European Union, David
  becomes a Congressman and then Vice President, setting the stage for the final
  confrontation between these brothers. When the President refuses to bend to
  the demands of Stone Alexander, he is disposed of like the others who oppose
  the New World Order. This makes David Alexander the President, who carries on
  heroically opposing his brother's megalomaniac plan of world union under his
  dictatorship.</p>
  <p align="left">In one scene, President David Alexander is drawn into a
  church, and as he enters the pastor is quoting Revelation. The pastor and
  congregation soon begin to chant &quot;Save us, Save us&quot;. Who do they
  want to save them? Could it be Jesus? Sadly no, they all have turned to David
  Alexander, and are asking him, the President, to save them as if <i>he</i>
  were their Messiah. Salvation does not come from Presidents, Priests, Popes or
  Pastors, it comes from faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and sadly TBN's Megiddo
  fails to deliver this gospel message.</p>
  <p align="left">When faced with a plague of locust / flies that issue from
  Stone's mouth, the renegade factions of the world (China, the U.S. and Mexico)
  seem to join the New World Order, gathering at Megiddo to meet with Stone, but
  betray him and begin an attack on his troops and command&nbsp; post. At this
  point Satan emerges from Stone's body and takes charge of the attack against
  the rebels. The form that TBN used to depict Satan, a bat-winged gargoyle-like
  creature, is reminiscent of Disney's Fantasia and Night on Bald Mountain.&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="left">
  When it seems that Satan has vanquished the rebels and has victory in hand, he
  is defeated in a scene that represents the second coming, and thrown into a
  lava river where he is chained in torment. If you have seen Raiders of the
  Lost Ark, and the scene where the Ark of the Covenant is opened, then you have
  basically seen the effects used to depict the second coming. Raiders had
  better effects, and after all, they did it first. However, like in Omega Code,
  Christ is never seen in the second coming scene of Megiddo.</p>
  <p align="left">Megiddo, like Omega Code, again has no apparent Christian
  characters in it, and the Gospel message of salvation through faith in Jesus
  Christ (who in Megiddo is only called &quot;the Nazarene&quot;) is never
  explained. The Omega movies two plots have little else in common, since the only
  character that is common to the two movies is Stone Alexander. Dr. Lane, who
  was prominent in the previous movie is not seen or even mentioned, and neither is
  Stone's second in
  command, Dominic. Still missing from Megiddo is any mention or depiction of
  the secret rapture, the seeming cornerstone of modern prophecy teaching, and
  any explanation of 666 or the mark of the beast. The
  supposed seven year peace treaty with Israel is also not mentioned, neither is
  the near fatal head wound to the beast. There is so much that is glaringly
  missing from this film.</p>
  <p align="left">The whole plot again revolves around the false teaching that
  the Antichrist is some non-religious Hitler-like dictator that will arise and
  take control of the world's governments in an effort to eventually rule in
  Jerusalem and declare himself to be God. This is known as Futurism, and is an
  interpretation of prophecy that actually developed in the Roman Catholic
  Church and gradually infiltrated Protestant teaching over the last 100 to 150
  years. It is an interpretation that was totally unknown to the Protestant
  reformers, all of which rightly identified the papacy as the Antichrist of
  biblical prophecy.</p>
  <p align="left">Boil this movie down and you have a boring first half of
  character development that eventually progresses to machineguns blazing,
  helicopter and fighter attacks, and massed troops and tanks in a special
  effects saturated battle sequence. Just how many helicopters, fighters or
  tanks can you get into one picture? TBN's Megiddo probably holds the record.
  But, in the end God apparently wins, with Satan chained in Hell in the bowels
  of the earth, having finally confessed the &quot;Nazarene&quot; to be Lord
  (Jesus was raised in Nazareth).</p>
  <p align="left">The bottom line: save your money, and don't waste it buying
  tickets for lost friends, since it portrays false prophecy and does not
  explain the gospel message. If you really want to see it then don't expect much.
  It would be better to wait until you can borrow the video from someone. You
  won't really be missing anything if you wait.</p>

  <p align="left"><b><font color="#FF0000">Megiddo a big box office loser</font>
  - </b><a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/MGDDO.html"><b>Megiddo's
      performance at the box office.</a> </b>Megiddo is said to have cost 25 million, 6 million of which is in special
      effects. Omega Code cost 7.2 million and grossed nearly 12 million. <a
  href="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1999/0OMEG.html"><b> Omega Code's box
      office figures</b>.</a>
      In order to break even, Megiddo needed to earn <i>twice</i> what Omega Code
      did, yet at the end of its ninth weekend, Megiddo had grossed a mere 6
  million dollars.</p>
  <p align="left">I suspect that about half the Christians who saw their first
  movie, Omega
  Code, were simply unwilling to shell out their hard earned bucks on large
  blocks of advance tickets, for a second fictional TBN end-times fantasy that <i> again</i>
  lacked a gospel presentation. The
  emperor still did not have any clothes, and the majority of the Christian
  audience were smart enough to know it. Megiddo simply had little evangelistic
  value, and this was apparently fatal to its box office performance, resulting
  in a staggering loss of nearly twenty million dollars (prior to any video
  sales, which may reduce the copious red ink).&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"> For comparison,
  another end-times movie that performed poorly, Cloud Ten's <i> Left Behind</i>, based
  on the popular book series by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, cost 17 to 20
  million dollars and <a
  href="http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2001/LEFTB.html"><b>grossed
  a mere $4,221,341 in theaters</b>.</a></p>
