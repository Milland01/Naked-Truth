<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In their opposition to
  Sunday laws Seventh-day Adventists reveal that they are callous to the needs
  of the working man and are blind to the fact that the very stability of the
  country is endangered by the godless course of millions who give no day in the
  week to God. It seems that they are more concerned to protect themselves
  against persecution than to give support either to the workingman or to the
  moral uplift of the country.</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the evident facts
  regarding our denomination is that it is composed, not of rich men, but of
  working men! Yet our whole membership are opposed to Sunday laws! Need more be
  said on this point?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next evident fact is that we are far from blind to the
  moral state of the world. Our literature says much about the woeful state of
  morality and the godless condition of men. The difference between us and the
  Sunday law advocates is not in the relative degree of our eyesight but in the
  methods that we believe should be employed to cure the malady of godlessness.
  They would bring in the kingdom of God through the gateway of politics, and
  have our legislators save us from destruction. We would invoke the promised
  second coming of Christ to save the ungodly from this evil world, and as we
  wait for His soon coming we work with earnestness to turn men to God by the
  preaching of the gospel.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third fact, which will become evident as we proceed, is
  that our opposition to Sunday legislation is not prompted by a selfish desire
  to save ourselves from possible persecution. We do not concede, of course,
  that there is anything necessarily selfish or evil in a person's invoking his
  constitutional rights to save himself from persecution. Even the great apostle
  Paul repeatedly invoked his Roman citizenship to save him from brutal
  treatment by his erstwhile brethren. Our reasons for opposition are these:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. As students of prophecy we believe that the day is
  coming</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 430]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">when the principles of religious intolerance
  that marked the Dark Ages will be revived, that there will be in the very
  closing hours of this world's history a mighty religio-political combine that
  will endeavor to dominate the consciences of men. We believe it is our solemn
  duty to warn men against giving their support to it. Indeed, we have no
  alternative in the matter, seeing that Christ, through the prophet John, has
  commanded us to cry out against this movement, so that men may be saved from
  giving their support to such an evil program.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In connection with this warning message that we are
  commanded to give, we find the injunction to proclaim the great Sabbath
  message to the world, and what more auspicious occasion could be found for
  giving special publicity to the true Sabbath than when men are endeavoring to
  stir up the world in support of the false? In this way our opposition to
  Sunday laws become not a negative but a positive thing. We simply capitalize
  the occasions of great public interest in Sunday laws to proclaim more fully
  the true Sabbath message.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the time of trouble begins, the people of God are to go
  forth to preach the Sabbath doctrine more fully and more convincingly than
  ever before. The agitation for Sunday legislation provides a choice
  illustration of how the wrath of man can be made to praise God; or, to state
  it in the most charitable form, how the endeavors of mistaken zealots can be
  made to serve a good purpose.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the widespread campaign that reformers have
  made through the public press and otherwise in recent years, there are
  probably more people who have become acquainted with the real facts on the
  Sabbath question than ever before, because every agitation by Sunday advocates
  has made newspaper and magazine editors even more than ready to publish matter
  giving the other side of the case. We would have been woefully remiss in our
  duty if we had failed to use these opportunities.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. We believe that there are many sincere and earnest men
  in the ranks of Sunday-law advocates. In fact, we are willing to admit</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 431]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">all of them are striving, according to their
  conception of the gospel, to advance the kingdom of God. But their sincerity
  does not make their course any the less wrong. If their program is carried
  out, and the strong arm of the law is drafted in their support, they will thus
  become persecutors.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can conceive of no fate more tragic than that of a man
  whose misguided zeal for God finally cause him to become a persecutor of
  others who are striving to preach the gospel. Christ foretold such a tragedy
  as this when He declared that the time will come when he that &quot;killeth
  you will think that he doeth God service.&quot; This divine forecast was
  fulfilled during the Middle Ages, and may be fulfilled again in the last days.
  In fact, at the very last there will be only two classes, the persecutors and
  the persecuted—those who give support to the great religio-political combine
  and those who, because of the opposing stand, are forbidden even to buy or
  sell. Not to save ourselves from being persecuted, but to save others from
  being persecutors, is the chief reason for our stand against Sunday laws. We
  have endeavored in all our literature to make clear to the reformers the evil
  direction in which they are going, and it should ever be in our zealous
  endeavor to do this in a spirit of charity and Christian love, making our
  attack on principles, not on persons.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The Scriptures plainly declare that we owe allegiance to
  the state, and should endeavor loyally and zealously to support it in the
  carrying out of its proper function. (See Rom. 13:1-7; Matt. 22:16:21.) In
  this fact is to be found a valid reason for our outcry against the endeavors
  of reformers to combine the church with the state. Knowing as we do from
  history and prophecy that such a combine can work only to the detriment of the
  citizens and to the destruction of the free institutions of the country, we
  would surely fail to carry out the full meaning of the divine injunction to
  support the government if we failed to raise our voice in warning against such
  a menacing danger.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truly loyal citizen is the man who possesses the moral
  courage to rise up and sound an alarm, even though he may be</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 432]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">in the minority, and his numerous opponents
  may be the advocates of an apparently good program. And the one who thus
  sounds the alarm is in no wise violating the principle of the separation of
  church and state. Instead, he is arousing all men to the need of continuing
  inviolate that vital separation.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Finally, we oppose Sunday legislation because we would
  protect Christianity from the false conception of it that the masses of the
  people would have if proposed religious legislation were allowed to go
  unchallenged. One of the greatest handicaps under which the minister of the
  gospel labors is the feeling of the part of the man on the street that the
  church symbolizes an organization that is striving to force its views upon the
  people. Surely there is a historical basis for such a feeling. And when the
  average individual, who is not a churchgoer, see the endeavors of present-day
  militant church leaders to employ the power of the state, the antipathy toward
  the church is only intensified.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are jealous to protect the Christian religion from this
  gross misconception. We could not be loyal to our divine Lord if we did not
  use every means possible to let men know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is
  not a gospel of force, and that He has commissioned His disciples to <i>invite</i>
  men to believe in Him. We would oppose with equal vigor any attempt to enforce
  the seventh-day Sabbath by law.</font></p>
