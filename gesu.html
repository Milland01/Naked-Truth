  Rome, built during the Catholic Counterreformation of the 16th century, there 
        is a
  sculpture group I wish to draw your attention to. It is titled <a href="http://www.chiesadelgesu.org/html/img_0076_it.html">&quot;Religion 
        Flagellates Heresy&quot;</a> by Pierre Le Gros, and is located at the altar built
  over the tomb (pictured at left) of Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the 
        Jesuits. </p>
  <p align="justify">The statuary in question is to the lower right of the altar, and is a 
  little difficult to see in this picture, but it does show the overall altar. It depicts a
  woman (Mary?) scourging two of the Protestant reformers, Martin Luther and John Huss.</p>

          translated the Bible into English in 1382. Wycliff advocated the right
          of the common man to read the Bible in his own language. Both Wycliff
          and Huss believed scripture to supersede the dogmas and ordinances of
          the church and both declared the Papacy to be the AntiChrist foretold
          in scripture. John Huss was burned alive* at the stake in 1415 for his
          &quot;heresy&quot; and rebellion against Catholic authority.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">Martin Luther challenged the Traditions of the Roman Catholic Church and
  coined the phrase Sola Scriptura, meaning the Bible only. In 1517 Luther
  posted 95 thesis to the door of the church in Wittenburg, challenging the
  authority of the Papacy and the sale of Indulgences. Martin Luther also
  declared the Papacy to be &quot;nothing else than the kingdom of Babylon and
  of very AntiChrist&quot; in his book On the Babylonian Captivity of the
  Church. Luther also translated the Bible into German, so that the German
  people could read scripture for themselves, in their own language.</p>
  <p align="justify">So both John Huss and Martin Luther championed the Bible over the
  Traditions and dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church and declared the Papacy to
  be the AntiChrist taught clearly by the Bible. So what book is the little
  angel tearing pages out of? What book did the reformers look to as &quot;the
  authority&quot; on matters of faith and doctrine, rather than decrees of the
  church? The answer should be quite clear.</p>
  <p align="justify">I have information from a credible source, who has visited Loyola's tomb in
  the Gesu, that it is indeed the Bible that the angel is tearing pages out of,
  based on the inscription on the back of the book. However, in some reference
  books, like &quot;The Pilgrim's Guide to Rome's Principal Churches,&quot; by
  Joseph N. Tylenda, the little cherub, called a <em>putto</em>, is described as
  destroying heretical books.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>* The Vatican Information Service (VIS) reported that on Dec 17th, 1999,
  Pope John Paul II made the following apology regarding the burning at the
  stake of Hus, while speaking before an international symposium on Jan Hus held
  at the Vatican:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Today, on the eve of the Great Jubilee, I feel the need to express
    deep regret for the cruel death inflicted on Jan Hus and for the consequent
    wound of conflict and division which was thus imposed on the minds and
    hearts of the Bohemian people.&quot;</p>
