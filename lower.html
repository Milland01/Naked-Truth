<blockquote>
  <p>This is apparently the actual quote from New York's late Archbishop John
  Cardinal O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral (Sunday, Nov. 24th, 1996) about
  Adam and Eve:</p>
  <blockquote>
    &quot;It isn't new teaching that the Holy Father was clarifying. What he
    wanted to emphasize is that physical or biological evolution is not the
    critical thing. What is critical is that every human person is made in the
    image and likeness of God, it is the Holy Spirit, that breathes life into a
    womb and brings forth a human being. It was this Spirit of God that breathed
    a soul in His image into the earth, as we are told in the Book of Genesis,
    or even, perhaps, into a lower animal, and brought forth man, brought forth
    woman by way of, we are told at least symbolically, a rib from the side of
    Adam.&quot;
  </blockquote>
  Cardinal O'Connor proposed that God breathed a &quot;soul&quot; into a
  pre-existing evolutionary sub-human ape-like creature and called him Adam. He
  also proposed that the biblical account of Eve's creation from Adam's rib is
  merely &quot;symbolic&quot;. From this one would have to conclude that he
  believed Eve evolved from the primordial soup over the eons as well, rather
  than being created in just one day. In other words he was saying Genesis does
  not tell you the truth when it speaks of a six day creation, rather it is
  merely symbolic, a fairy tale or a fable, but not a factual account. Truth
  apparently is to be found in atheistic Darwinian theory, but not in Genesis,
  the word of God?
  <p>Here is a short article about Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor's remarks

  <p>So did man really evolve? Is Genesis a fairy tale? Can the Christian
  believe in evolution as now endorsed by the Pope and Archbishop of New York? <img
