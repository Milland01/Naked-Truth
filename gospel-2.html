  <hr>
  <p>Here is how one Catholic explains the death of Jesus Christ:</p>

      <tr>
        <td>Make no mistake about it. Protestants will try to tell you that 
        Christ underwent our punishment--He did not! If that were so, then 
        Christ would have had to be sent to hell for all eternity, for this is 
        what we truly deserve (cf. Revelation 20:13-14). Christ suffered for us, 
        it is no question, but He did so in order to earn for us God's 
        forgiveness, not so that we would not have to suffer or be punished 
        temporarily. In other words, Jesus helped us avoid hell not by 
        undergoing the punishment Himself, but by offering Himself to God in 
        order to appease His wrath and prevent His justice from being executed 
        (cf. Isaiah 53:10-12, Hebrews 2:17). Just like lambs and goats were 
        slain in the Old Testament in order to appease the wrath of God, so 
        Christ was slain and slaughtered to appease God's wrath, but with Christ 
        it was once and for all. Goats and lambs, being finite creatures, had to 
        be offered again and again as people sinned again. However, Christ's 
        Sacrifice, being infinite and perfect and without any possible blemish, 
        was most pleasing and hence is sufficient for the Father to forgive any 
        sin committed and no more Sacrifice is needed.

    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Note that Mario clearly denies that Christ took upon Himself our sins, 
  taking them to the cross, suffering the punishment of death that we sinners 
  deserved. This stems from the Catholic teaching of eternal punish<i>ing</i> 
  and torment in a place called Hell, which they teach is the inevitable fate of 
  the unrepentant sinner. (See <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a href="hell.html"><b>The Biblical Truth About Hell</b></a>)</p>
  <p>And here is how another Catholic writer addresses the same issue:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The guilt of actual sin cannot be transferred from one soul to another. 
    To assert that the guilt of men's sins was transferred to our Lord dying on 
    the Cross is absurd and blasphemous.&quot;</p>

    Conway of the Paulist Fathers, copyright 1929 by the Missionary Society of 
    St. Paul the Apostle in the State of New York, published by the Paulist 
    Press, 401 West 59th Street, New York, page 58.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What is the biblical penalty for sin?</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>The Wages of Sin</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Gen 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of 
    every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br>
    Gen 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not 
    eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Adam was warned. As long as he was obedient, and did not eat from the 
  forbidden tree, he would live. He would live forever in harmony with his 
  creator God. But rebel against the law of God and the penalty would be a 
  forfeiture of his life. Eat from the forbidden tree and a death sentence would 
  be immediately imposed on Adam.<br>
  How was that death sentence carried out after Adam sinned?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, 
    to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of 
    the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
    Gen 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to 
    till the ground from whence he was taken.<br>
    Gen 3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of 
    Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way 
    of the tree of life.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The day that Adam and Eve sinned by eating the forbidden fruit, they were 
  expelled from the garden of Eden and not permitted to return. This expulsion 
  effectively prevented Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of life. Without 
  access to the tree of life Adam and Eve would inevitably perish.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return 
    unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto 
    dust shalt thou return.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because Adam had sinned, the penalty of death entered the world:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death 
    by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So what, according to the Bible is the wages of sin? What is the penalty 
  for sin?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal 
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u><i>Death</i> Is the Penalty for Sin</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Ezek 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the 
    father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall 
    die.</p>
    <p align="left">Ezek 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</p>
    <p align="left">Prov 13:14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to 
    depart from the snares of death.</p>
    <p align="left">Prov 14:27 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to 
    depart from the snares of death.</p>
    <p align="left">John 3:16 <font color="#FF0000">For God so loved the world, 
    that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should 
    not perish, but have everlasting life.</font></p>
    <p align="left">John 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting 
    life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of 
    God abideth on him.</p>
    <p align="left">John 5:24 <font color="#FF0000">Verily, verily, I say unto 
    you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath 
    everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from 
    death unto life.</font></p>
    <p align="left">Rom 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus 
    hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</p>
    <p align="left">James 1:15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth 
    sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
    <p align="left">James 5:20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner 
    from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a 
    multitude of sins.</p>
    <p align="left">1 John 3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto 
    life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth 
    in death.<br>
    1 John 3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no 
    murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.<br>
    1 John 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his 
    life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There are two fates for all of humanity. Life through faith in the atoning 
  death of Christ on the cross, or death for the sinner who lacks faith. The 
  unsaved will <i>not see life</i>, they will <i>perish</i>. Eternal punishing 
  and torment in Hell for sinners is a perversion of scripture and a Catholic 
  fiction. Hell is the grave, a complete cessation of life.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>Regaining Access to the Tree of Life</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 2:7 <font color="#FF0000">He that hath an ear, let him 
    hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I 
    give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of 
    God.</font></p>
    <p align="left">Rev 22:2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either 
    side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of 
    fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were 
    for the healing of the nations.</p>
    <p align="left">Rev 22:14 <font color="#FF0000">Blessed are they that do his 
    commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in 
    through the gates into the city.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Adam and Eve, after they sinned, were prevented from eating from the tree 
  of life. This prevented them from living forever as sinners. <i>Sin and 
  sinners were not permitted to be eternal</i>. God has not changed His mind. 
  Those without faith will <i>not</i> be given access to the the Tree of Life, 
  just like Adam and Eve were denied it and were denied eternal life. 
  Consequently, sin and sinners must surely come to an end, cease to exist. When 
  the last sinner has perished in the lake of fire, sin and sinners will be no 
  longer. Those with faith will again be given access to the tree of life, and 
  so will not be subject to the second death:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: 
    on such the second death hath no power, ...</p>
    <p>Rev 20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the 
    second death.<br>
    Rev 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast 
    into the lake of fire.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
    <p>John 11:25 Jesus said unto her, <font color="#FF0000">I am the 
    resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, 
    yet shall he live:</font><br>
    John 11:26 <font color="#FF0000"><b>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me 
    shall never die</b>. Believest thou this?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is this <i>second</i> death that Christ died for us. For those with 
  faith, the second death will have no power over them. However, in the second 
  death, all sinners will <i>perish</i> in the lake of fire: sinners and sin 
  cease to be. With no sin in the universe there will never again be death. We 
  are promised <i>victory over this second death</i> if we have faith in 
  Christ's atoning death on the cross:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 25:8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe 
    away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take 
    away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
    <p>Mat 16:18 <font color="#FF0000">And I say also unto thee, That thou art 
    Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell
    </font>(death / the grave)<font color="#FF0000"> shall not prevail against 
    it.</font></p>
    <p>1 Cor 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and 
    this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the 
    saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>
    1 Cor 15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?<br>
    1 Cor 15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>If The Wages Of Sin Is <i>Death,</i><br>
    Did Christ Really Die <i>In Our Place</i> On The Cross?</u></font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Isa 53:5 But <b>he was wounded for our transgressions, he 
    was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;</b> 
    and with his stripes we are healed.<br>
    Isa 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his 
    own way; and <b>the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</b></p>
    <p align="left">Isa 53:10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put 
    him to grief: when thou shalt make <b><i>his soul</i> an offering for sin</b>, 
    he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the 
    LORD shall prosper in his hand.<br>
    Isa 53:11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: 
    by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for <b>he shall 
    bear their iniquities</b>.<br>
    Isa 53:12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall 
    divide the spoil with the strong; because <b>he hath poured out his soul 
    unto death</b>: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and <b>he bare 
    the sin of many</b>, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Christ laid down His life for our sins. Death is the penalty 
  for sin, and that is precisely the price Christ paid in our place.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1 Cor 15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which 
    I also received, how that <b>Christ died for our sins</b> according to the 
    scriptures;</p>
    <p align="left">2 Cor 5:14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because 
    we thus judge, that <b>if one died for all, then were all dead:</b><br>
    2 Cor 5:15 And that he <b>died for all</b>, that they which live should not 
    henceforth live unto themselves, but unto <b>him which died for them</b>, 
    and rose again.</p>
    <p align="left">2 Cor 5:21 For <b>he hath made him </b>(Christ)<b> to be sin 
    for us</b>, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God 
    in him.</p>
    <p align="left">Gal 3:13 <b>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the 
    law, being made a curse for us</b>: for it is written, Cursed is every one 
    that hangeth on a tree:</p>
    <p align="left">Rom 6:7 For <b>he that is dead is freed from sin</b>.<br>
    Rom 6:8 Now if <b>we be dead with Christ</b>, we believe that we shall also 
    live with him:<br>
    Rom 6:9 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death 
    hath no more dominion over him.<br>
    Rom 6:10 For in that he died, <b>he died unto sin once</b>: but in that he 
    liveth, he liveth unto God.<br>
    Rom 6:11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but 
    alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
    <p align="left">1 Th 5:9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to 
    obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
    1 Th 5:10 <b>Who died for us</b>, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should 
    live together with him.</p>
    <p align="left">1 Pet 2:21 For even hereunto were ye called: because <b>
    Christ also suffered for us</b>, leaving us an example, that ye should 
    follow his steps:<br>
    1 Pet 2:22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:<br>
    1 Pet 2:23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he 
    threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:<br>
    1 Pet 2:24 <b>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree</b>, 
    that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose 
    stripes ye were healed.</p>
    <p align="left">1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto 
    you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the 
    Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:<br>
    1 John 2:2 And <b>he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours 
    only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</b></p>
    <p align="left">1 John 4:9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, 
    because that <b>God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might 
    live through him.</b><br>
    1 John 4:10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
    <b>sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</b></p>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>The Good News!</u></font></b></p>
    <p align="left">Heb 2:9 But we see <b>Jesus</b>, <b>who was made a little 
    lower than the angels for the suffering of death</b>, crowned with glory and 
    honour; that he <b>by the grace of God should taste death for every man</b>.</p>
    <p align="left">Heb 9:28 <b>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of 
    many</b>; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time 
    without sin unto salvation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ paid the price for our sins. Christ died for us,<i> in our 
  place. He paid the penalty of death that we should have paid, so that by faith 
  in His atoning death and resurrection we might live forever with Him in 
  victory over the law of sin and death. </i><b><font size="4">That is the <i>
  good news</i>, the Gospel message that the Bible teaches in verity. </font>
  </b><font size="3">This Gospel Mario Derksen <i>denies.</i></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you 
    into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
    Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would 
    pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
    Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto 
    you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
    Gal 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other 
    gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>May Mario even yet accept the gospel message, that Christ died <i>in his 
  place</i>, that He who knew no sin became sin, and paid the price for Mario's 
  sins, <i>death</i>, and that by this faith, he, Mario Derksen, might not die 
  the second death, but be permitted to one day eat from the tree of life, and 
  live forever, as the Bible teaches. And so may we all.</p>
