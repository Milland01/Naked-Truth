<blockquote>
  <p>Beginning on February 22, 1931, a Polish nun named Sister Faustina claimed 
  to have seen visions of Jesus, and heard Jesus speak to her soul. Jesus is 
  alleged to have said to Sister Faustina:</p>

  <p>Pretty amazing claim isn't it? Merely venerate (worship) this image of 
  Jesus on the Sunday after Easter and you are <i>guaranteed</i> eternal life! 
  Millions of Catholics attend services on the Sunday after Easter expecting to 
  obtain eternal life by merely worshipping an image of Jesus (shown above). 
  Catholics are also taught that if they will go to confession and participate 
  in Communion that day (Diary, 699), all their sins and all punishment due them 
  will be washed away as though they were being baptized again, Divine Mercy 
  Sunday being <i>greater</i> in its effect than a plenary indulgence. (A 
  plenary <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> 
  only removes temporal punishment due for sins, <i>it does not forgive the sins 
  themselves</i>.)</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Sister Gratia also suggests that should a notorious sinner die that day, 
  after attending confession and the Mass, they would go straight to heaven 
  (bypassing Purgatory), since all their sins and all punishment due would have 
  been forgiven that day. In Sister Faustina's diary, the alleged apparition of 
  Jesus is also quoted as saying that this feast of Divine Mercy is &quot;the last 
  hope of salvation.&quot; <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><a href="Sister-Gratia.mp3">

    hour of death. Priests will recommend it to sinners as their last hope of 
    salvation.&quot;</font></b> (Diary, 687).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sister Gratia also claims that Sister Faustina was so gifted that she was 
  capable of bi-location, the ability to be in two places at the same time!</p>
  <p>On April 18, 1993 (Divine Mercy Sunday), Sister Faustina was beatified in 
  Rome by Pope John Paul II, and then canonized on April 30th, 2000 (also Divine 
  Mercy Sunday), so now she is <i>Saint</i> Faustina Kowalska.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>4. It is important then that we accept the whole message that comes to us 
    from the word of God on this Second Sunday of Easter, which from now on 
    throughout the Church will be called &quot;Divine Mercy Sunday&quot;.</p>

  <p>So April 22nd, 2001 was the first Divine Mercy Sunday available to all 
  Catholics worldwide, when they could all venerate, as promised by the 
  apparition, the image that is the vessel for grace that will prevent them from 
  perishing, that they may gain eternal life. The net effect of this teaching is 
  that Divine Mercy Sunday will likely become the most heavily attended feast on 
  the Catholic calendar, exceeding even Easter or Christmas, due to the unique 
  advantages attributed to it for obtaining God's mercy.</p>

  <p>It is faith in Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God that will result in eternal 
  life, not veneration of an image, not even veneration of an image of Jesus. 
  Because this vision of Sister Faustina clearly contradicts the Commandment of 
  God forbidding image worship, it is <strong><em>not from God</em></strong>. 
  There is <strong><em>no light </em></strong>in it. The Feast of Divine Mercy 
  is nothing but idolatry and apostasy, plain and simple, and now it has 
  essentially been <i>canonized</i> by the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
