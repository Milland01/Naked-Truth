Vaticanus is uncertain; some claim that the name comes from a vanished

  <p>Research the word <i>Vatican</i> in many Latin - English /
English - Latin dictionaries, or encyclopedias, and you will likely
find that Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica of the Roman Catholic
Church were built upon what was called in Latin <i>vaticanus mons</i>
or <i>vaticanus collis</i>. The words <i> mons</i> and <i>collis</i>
mean hill or mountain. You will also find in the dictionaries that the
words vatic / vates / vatis all relate to prophecy as shown here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Vaticanus then is a combination of Vatic + anus, just
as Romanus is a combination of Rome + anus. Therefore, vaticanus collis
or vaticanus mons mean <i>"the prophetic hill or mountain"</i>, which
can be rephrased as <b><i>the hill or mountain of prophecy.</i></b>
The word Vatican is just a shortened form of the word Vaticanus, just
like Claudian is a shortened form of Claudianus, as shown above. This
association of the Vatican with prophecy is even confirmed by this
recent Catholic book:</p>
  <blockquote> <b> </b>
    <p><b>Where does the word "Vatican" come from and what does it mean?</b></p>
    <p>The word derives from the Latin <i>vates</i>, which means
"tellers of the future." This name was the name given to a hillside on
the west bank of the Tiber River in Rome because daily lineups of
fortunetellers used to hawk their "wares" there to passersby on the
street. In the fourteenth century, when the papacy was returned to Rome
from Avignon (France), the present-day Vatican became the residence of
the popes, and the word came to refer to the enclave in the middle of
Rome that had become the seat of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;Here is a verse from the Latin Vulgate Bible and King James
as an example of the use of vatic (emphasis is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>

that he pronounced this <b>prophecy</b> against me: for Tobiah and
Sanballat had hired him.</p>

  <p>Now, note the following coins minted in Vatican City from 1955 to
1965 under three Popes. The inscription on the reverse side of the coin
reads in Italian "CITTÁ DEL VATICANO", which as we can now see, means <b><i>City
of Prophecy</i>.</b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">A Woman In Prophecy Symbolizes
A Church</font></b></u></p>
  <p>In scripture a woman is used symbolically to depict the church,
and the faithful church of saints is described as the bride of Christ:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 11:2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I
have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste
virgin to Christ.</p>
    <p>Rev 19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for
the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.<br>
Rev 19:8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of
saints.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And a godly woman's appearance is clearly described in scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 2:9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in
modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; <i>not with broided
hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array</i>;<br>
1 Tim 2:10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good
works.</p>
    <p>1 Pet 3:3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of
plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;<br>
1 Pet 3:4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
in the sight of God of great price.<br>
1 Pet 3:5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also,
who trusted in God, adorned themselves,</p>
    <p>Rev 12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
crown of twelve stars:<br>
Rev 12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
pained to be delivered.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u>The symbol of the sun:</u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of
righteousness [Christ] arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go
forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</p>
    <p>Psa 119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy
commandments are righteousness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u>The symbol of the moon:</u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
faithful witness [testimony] in heaven.</p>
    <p>John 5:39 <font color="#ff0000">Search the scriptures; for in
them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of
me.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u>The symbol of the stars:</u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 1:20 <font color="#ff0000">The mystery of the seven stars
which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.
The seven stars are the angels </font>[messengers]<font color="#ff0000">
of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are
the seven churches.</font></p>
    <p>Dan 12:3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of
the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars
for ever and ever.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the woman of Revelation 12, the true church, is clothed with
the righteousness of Christ, keeping the commandments of God, standing
as a faithful witness upon the word of God, the scriptures, crowned
with the gospel message of the 12 apostles, the new covenant
representation of the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;<big> </big><b><u><font size="5">The
Apostate Church</font></u></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However, the woman described in Revelation 17 represents an
apostate church, the direct opposite of the true and faithful church
represented by the woman described in Revelation 12. While the Roman
Catholic Church readily and willingly identifies itself as the woman of
Revelation 12, the bride of Christ, it is precisely and graphically
described in Revelation 17, as we shall see.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:1 ... Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment of
the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:<br>
Rev 17:2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of
her fornication.<br>

  <p>The woman of Revelation 17 rides a symbolic beast. A beast in
scripture is symbolic of an empire or state. Examples of this are
explained in Daniel 7, where a lion represented Babylon, a bear<font

woman of Revelation 17 riding a beast is symbolic of the combining of
the ecclesiastical power of church (the woman) and political power of
the state (the beast), i.e., a church in control of state power.</p>

  <p align="center"><u><font size="5">The Harlot Church's Missing Color</font></u></p>
  <p align="left">The garments of the high priest of Israel, according
to the Bible, contained specific colors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 28:3 And thou shalt speak unto all that are
wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they
may make Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
me in the priest's office.<br>
Exo 28:4 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre,
and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother,
and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br>
Exo 28:5 And they shall take gold, and <u>blue</u>, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine linen.<br>
Exo 28:6 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of <u>blue</u>, and of
purple, of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.<br>
Exo 28:7 It shall have the two shoulder pieces thereof joined at the
two edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.<br>
Exo 28:8 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of <u>blue</u>,
and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
    <p align="left">Exo 28:31 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod
    <u>all of blue</u>.</p>
    <p align="left">Exo 39:1 And of the <u>blue</u>, and purple, and
scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place,
and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.<br>
Exo 39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, <u>blue</u>, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine twined linen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">In comparison, the garments of the high priest
include the color blue, which is notably absent in the description of
the woman of Revelation 17.:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:4 And <strong>the woman was arrayed in
purple and scarlet colour</strong>, and decked with gold and precious
stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations
and filthiness of her fornication:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The Bible even tells us the spiritual meaning of the
color blue:</p>

that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout
their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a <u>
ribband of blue:</u><br>
Num 15:39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, <u>that ye may look
upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them</u>;
and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after
which ye use to go a whoring:<br>

unto your God.</p>
          <p>Deu 22:12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four
quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In Numbers 15, the context for the blue tassels or ribbands
is <u> intentional</u> sinning (Num 15:30-31) and breaking the sabbath
commandment (Num 15:32-36). Note that there is no mention of repentance
by the man who was gathering sticks, he was breaking the sabbath
intentionally in open defiance of the law. For that he was put to death.</p>

  <p align="left">This practice of blue in tassels survives today in
the Jewish prayer shawl, known as a tallit. The tassel with the ribband
of blue on the four corners of the tallit is called a tzitzit, and one
is shown above.</p>
  <p align="left">All blue cloth was also specified to be used to cover
the furniture and utensils of the sanctuary of Moses when it was
disassembled for transport to a new location (Num 4:5-12).</p>

mount Sinai (Exo 24:10), which makes up the very throne of God (Eze
1:26, 10:1). So, the Ark of the Covenant in the most holy apartment of
the sanctuary, the throne of God's presence (the Shekinah glory),
contained the blue sapphire tablets of the Ten Commandments.</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="5">Healing in his Wings</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mal 4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the
Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go
forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Malachi 4:2 is a messianic prophecy, it is speaking
of Jesus Christ. So what does healing in his wings mean? The word
translated "wings" is H3671:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">H3671. kanaph, kaw-nawf'; from H3670; an edge or
extremity; spec. (of a bird or army) a wing, (of a garment or
bed-clothing) a flap, (of the earth) a quarter, (of a building) a
pinnacle:-- + bird, border, corner, end, feather [-ed], X flying, +
(one an-) other, overspreading, X quarters, skirt, X sort, uttermost
part, wing ([-ed]).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So Malachi was really saying that the Messiah would
have healing in the edge or <u>fringe of His garment</u>. This&nbsp;
was what was understood by the people of Israel. How do we know that?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mat 14:35 And when the men of that place had
knowledge of him [Jesus], they sent out into all that country round
about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;<br>
Mat 14:36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mat 9:20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased
with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the
hem of his garment:<br>
Mat 9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
shall be whole.<br>
Mat 9:22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the
woman was made whole from that hour.</p>
    <p align="left">See also Mark 5:25-34 and Luke 8:43-48.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The fringe or tassel of Christ's garment undoubtedly
included the sapphire blue ribband as directed in Numbers 15:38-39 as
mentioned above, that symbolized the commandments of God. That is why
the woman sought so earnestly to touch that hem or fringe. She knew
Malachi's prophecy, and in faith she made her way through the crowd to
claim that healing.</p>
  <p align="left">So regarding the whoring harlot church, though she
claims to be God's representative on earth, the missing color blue in
her description indicates that she defiantly disregards and
transgresses the law of God. One of the characteristics of the
antichrist power is lawlessness:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[NIV] 2 Th 2:3 Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that
day will not come until the rebellion occurs and <u>the man of
lawlessness</u> is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.</p>
    <p>[NIV] 2 Th 2:7 For the secret <u>power of lawlessness</u> is
already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do
so till he is taken out of the way.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And, note what the antichrist little horn power tries to change:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:25 And he [little horn] shall speak great words against
the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and <u>think
to change times and laws [of the most High]</u>: and they shall be
given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The only one of the ten commandments of God that deals with time
is the sabbath commandment (Exo. 20:8-11), which the Catholic Church
claims to have changed, from Saturday the seventh day, to Sunday, the
first day of the week:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>2175</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday is expressly distinguished
from the sabbath which it follows chronologically every week; for
Christians its ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath.</p>

  <p>For a striking contrast, note how the true church, symbolized by
the woman of Revelation 12, is described:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed, which <u>keep the commandments
of God</u>, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="4">THE ULTIMATE FATE OF THE HARLOT

    <p>Lev 21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself
by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with
fire.</p>
    <p>Rev 17:16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast,
these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and
shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><u><font size="5">Blasphemy</font></u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The scriptures give us several examples of blasphemy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mark 2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto
the sick of the palsy, <font color="#ff0000">Son, thy sins be forgiven
thee.</font><br>
Mark 2:6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and
reasoning in their hearts,<br>
Mark 2:7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
but God only?</p>
    <p align="left">John 10:32 Jesus answered them, <font
 color="#ff0000">Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for
which of those works do ye stone me?</font><br>
John 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest
thyself God.</p>
    <p align="left">Rev 2:9&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">I know thy
works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the
blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the
synagogue of Satan.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So, a man falsely claiming the power to forgive the
sins of men, a man falsely claiming to be God on earth, and men falsely
claiming to be the true church of God are all clearly defined as
blasphemy. Note the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>Priests and bishops are, as it were, the interpreters
and heralds of God, commissioned in his name to teach mankind the" law
of God, and the precepts of a Christian life&#8212;they are the
representatives of God upon earth. Impossible, therefore, to conceive a
more exalted dignity, or functions more sacred. Justly, therefore, are
they called not only angels,' but gods.<sup>3</sup> holding, as they
do, the place and power and authority of God on earth. But the
priesthood, at all times an elevated office, transcends in the New Law
all others in dignity. The power of consecrating and offering the body
and blood of our Lord and of remitting sin, with which the priesthood
of the New Law is invested, is such as cannot be comprehended by the
human mind, still less is it equalled by, or assimilated to, any thing
on earth.</blockquote>

      <p><em>Power of Consecrating</em></p>
      </center>
      <p>The third great power of the priestly office is the climax of
all. It is the power of consecrating. "No act is greater," says saint
Thomas, "than the consecration of the body of Christ." In this
essential phase of the sacred ministry, the power of the priest is not
surpassed by that of the bishop, the archbishop, the cardinal or the
pope. Indeed it is equal to that of Jesus Christ. For in this role the
priest speaks with the voice and the authority of God Himself.</p>
      <p>When the priest pronounces the tremendous words of
consecration, he reaches up into the heaven, brings Christ down from
His throne, and places Him upon our altar to be offered up again as the
victim for the sins of man. It is a power greater than that of monarchs
and emperors. It is greater than that of saints and angels, greater
than that of Seraphim and Cherubim. Indeed, it is greater than the
power of the Virgin Mary. While the blessed virgin was the human agency
by which Christ became incarnate a single time, the priest brings
Christ down from heaven, and renders Him present on our altar as the
eternal victim for the sins of man-not once, but, a thousand times! The
priest speaks and lo! Christ the eternal and omnipotent God, bows His
head in humble obedience to the priest's command. </p>
      <p>[pg.271] Of what sublime dignity is the office of the
Christian priest who is thus privileged to act as the ambassador and
the vicegerent of Christ on earth. He continues the essential ministry
of Christ - he teaches the faithful with the authority of Christ, he
offers up again the same sacrifice of adoration and atonement which
Christ offered on Calvary. No wonder that the name which spiritual
writers are especially fond of applying to the priest is that of "alter
Christus." For the priest is and should be another Christ. </p>

	is not an identity card. Christian identity means being a member of the 
	Church, since <strong>all these people belonged to the Church, to Mother 
	Church, for apart from the Church it is not possible to find Jesus.</strong> 
	The great Paul VI said: it is an absurd dichotomy to wish to live with Jesus 
	but without the Church, to follow Jesus but without the Church, to love 
	Jesus but without the Church (cf. <i>

	also gives us an identity which is not simply a rubber stamp: it is 
	membership. Identity means membership, belonging. Belonging to the Church:

  <p>This self-proclaimed "mother" church is also Mystery Babylon, the
apostate church of Mysteries and the purveyor of Babylonian doctrinal
confusion. Note this quote of John Paul II from the Vatican Information
Service press release dated 17 September, 1997, (emphasis is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Thanks to greater attention to the <b>mystery of the Church</b>
and Mary's relationship with her, the Virgin has begun to be invoked
more frequently as 'Mother of the Church.'</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mystery is also the term used by the Roman Catholic Church to
refer to the Mass, specifically the transubstantiation of the bread and
wine into the body and blood of Christ. It is a key part of Catholic
dogma. These are the words of the priest in Latin or English (emphasis
is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>HIC EST ENIM CALIX SANGUINIS MEI, NOVI ET AETERNI TESTAMENTI: <b>
MYSTERIUM FIDEI</b>, QUI PRO VOBIS ET PRO MULTIS EFFUNDETUR IN
REMISSIONEM PECCATORUM.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;FOR THIS IS THE CHALICE OF MY BLOOD, OF THE NEW AND
ETERNAL TESTAMENT, THE <b>MYSTERY OF FAITH</b>, WHICH FOR YOU AND FOR
MANY SHALL BE SHED UNTO THE REMISSION OF SINS.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Catholic is also well familiar with many "mysteries" through
the recitation of their Hail Marys and the rosary. There are 15 decades
of prayer (150 recitations) and during each decade of ten recitations,
the Catholic contemplates on one of the "mysteries" of the church,
which are as follows:</p>

    </big>
    <div align="justify"><span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one is more honest
with Protestants than
we are, for no one knows them better. There is a great deal of
controversy now going on as to the attitude of Protestants towards
Catholics holding political office. We have published statements from
Baptist and Lutheran bodies, and individual declarations from prominent
men in all the Protestant sects. They are all agreed on the question.
They would not vote for a Catholic for political office, least of all
for the presidency of the United States; and they all give the same or
similar reasons. Some say it is because Catholics owe their allegiance
to the Pope, and therefore they cannot vote for them. Others declare
that all Catholics believe in the union of Church and State; and they
under no circumstances would vote to give them political power. Others
give other reasons; but one and all declare that they would not vote
for Catholics, and mostly all for the two reasons given above. </span>
		<br class="auto-style1">
    <big class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is there not a reason behind these two
reasons
which these Protestants are not willing to admit even to
themselves?&nbsp; Are not these two reasons too theoretical and
entirely too academic for the majority of Protestants? They know very
little of the meaning and import of allegiance, civil or ecclesiastic;
and they do not know what Catholics understand by the term. They have a
very vague and indistinct notion of the union of Church and State, and
are not aware that such union exists more or less in every state in
Christendom. What they really oppose and what they wish to emphasize by
their vote is that they do want want to be dragooned into the Catholic
Church. They fear that if the Catholic Church should get the upper hand
in this country she might induce the state to suppress all heretical
worship and compel all to embrace the Catholic faith. And this fear is
not irrational, if unfounded. The Church has persecuted. Only a&nbsp;
tyro in church history will deny that. The Apologists in the days of
Roman imperial domination inveighed against persecution and with
Tertullian deplored that "it was no part of religion to persecute
religion." But after the days of Constantine and under the reign of
that first Christian emperor the attitude of Christians underwent a
change, and persecution of pagans took place in many places in the
empire. A hundred and fifty years after Constantine the Donatists were
persecuted and sometimes put to death. Against this extreme measure St.
Augustine raised his voice; but he was willing that they should
despoiled of their churches and of their goods. Protestants were
persecuted in France and and Spain with the full approval of the Church
authorities. We have always defended the superventions of the Huguenots
and the Spanish Inquisition. Wherever and whenever there is
honest&nbsp; Catholicity there will be a clear distinction drawn
between truth and error, and Catholicity and all forms of heresy. When
she thinks it good to use physical force the Church will use it. She is
no better nor holier than God; and God has used physical force to bring
people to embrace the truth. If the Church ever again finds herself in
the same circumstances as surrounded her in the days of the Donatists
and Huguenots and the Moriscoes it is very probable that she will
defend herself with the same weapons she used before. But will those
conditions ever return? We hope not for the sake of both persecutor and
persecuted. The Protestants of the world fear that the history of
persecution will repeat itself. If so it will be brought about by
themselves. They fear that they will be forced to embrace the Catholic
faith. They never will be as long as they allow Catholics to profess
their religion in peace. But if they want war they will be promptly
accommodated.</big><br class="auto-style1">
    	<span class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But will the Catholic Church give bond that
she will
not persecute at all? Will she guarantee absolute freedom and equality
of all churches and all faiths? The Catholic Church gives no bonds for
her good behavior. She has made mistakes in her policy which she
promptly corrected as soon as discovered. She has countenanced violence
when more human measures would have been of more avail. Her children
and her clergy have often been carried away by popular passion. But she
gives no bonds that such things shall not occur again.</span><br class="auto-style1">
    <big class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should the Church be required to
furnish
security of good behavior? Civil governments have been tyrannical. But
we must have civil government. The state has oppressed, and kings have
abused their power. But we must have the state to maintain order and
protect life and property. So it is with the Church; only more so. We
must have the Church. She is the means of grace to a lost world. She is
salvation to all mankind. Without the state we have anarchy; without
the Church we have spiritual chaos. &#8213;

  <ul>
    <li>For 1260 years the papacy ruled over Europe, from 538 to 1798.
During these dark ages the papacy exercised both political and
ecclesiastical power, the woman <i>rode the beast</i>, the beast <i>that
was</i>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>The papacy lost its political power <a href="h-wound.html">February
15th, 1798</a>, with the capture of Pius VI by the armies of Napoleon,
and it lost the last of the <a
 href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, on
September 20th, 1870 when Italian troops seized the city of Rome,
leaving the Pope a virtual prisoner in the Vatican. The Catholic Church
had lost her political power and sovereignty, consequently the beast <i>was
not</i>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Now, John in chapter 17, sees the harlot in her final phase <i>after</i>
she has <i>regained</i> her lost political power (sit on the beast),
and the world wonders at her revival. Papal sovereignty was restored
February 11th, 1929 with the signing of the <a href="wound.html">Lateran
Treaty</a> with Benito Mussolini. And <i>yet the beast is</i>. It has
ascended back out of extinction, or the bottomless pit, and proceeds
from there to its destruction.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<b><u><font size="5">The City of Seven
Mountains</font></u></b></p>
  <p>The woman of Revelation 17 sits on seven mountains:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads
are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, some Roman Catholic apologists will likely try to apply this
passage to the city of Jerusalem. However, this verse tells us that the
woman of Revelation 17, an apostate persecuting <i>Christian</i>
church, <i>sits,</i> or headquarters itself, in a city of seven
mountains. <i>No such Christian church has its administrative
headquarters in Jerusalem, </i>so it can be easily dismissed as a
possibility. It is also worth noting that Revelation was written by
John about 95 A.D., some 25 years <i>after</i> Jerusalem had been
besieged and completely destroyed by the Romans. This also removes it
from consideration in the prophecy, since the Jews did not return to
Jerusalem until the 20th century.</p>
  <p>John the Revelator further amplifies and defines the harlot as
follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city,
which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So we need to look for an apostate persecuting Christian church,
that attempts to rule over the kings of the earth from a great city,
known for having seven mountains. So let's consider the great Eternal
City of Rome, headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. Look in most
any encyclopedia and you will find that Rome is known as the city of
seven hills, or seven mountains. These seven mountains are the
Capitoline, Quirinal, Viminal, Esquiline, Cælian (Coelian/Celio),
Aventine and Palatine, highlighted in yellow below.</p>

  <p>It is extremely interesting, to say the least, to see a <i>Roman</i>
Catholic apologist, whose church is governed by the Bishop of <i>Rome,</i>
trying to extricate his church from that city. Rome, like many European
cities, has fortified city walls around its perimeter. The original
walls of the city of the Caesars, built between 272 and 279 by
Aurelian, did not include the area of the Vatican hill on the west bank
of the Tiber, so it is true, as Patrick Madrid says, that Vatican hill
was likely considered outside the city limits of the <i>pagan</i> <a

between 848 and 852. He fortified Vatican hill against future
attacks by including it within the perimeter of the city walls, which
were extended eastward to Hadrian's tomb (Castel Sant'Angelo). To honor
Leo IV, the newly enclosed Vatican was called the
Leonine City. The remains of these defensive walls can still be seen
today around the Vatican. Most notable is a narrow passageway (<a

pope be heard on this issue:</p>

was made by Him the capital of the whole world, because He made it the
seat of a sovereignty which, since it extends beyond the confines of
nations and states, embraces within itself all the peoples of the whole
world. The very origin and divine nature of this sovereignty demands,
the inviolable rights of conscience of millions of the faithful of the
whole world demand that this sacred sovereignty must not be, neither

on the Coelian (Celio/Cælian) Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome (Rev

donated the building to the Bishop of Rome in the 4th century. It is

  <p>Since 1377, upon the return to Rome from Avignon, Church
administration has been located in the Vatican, rather than the
Lateran. However, as the cathedra (official seat) of the Bishop of
Rome, the Pope, the Lateran is today still considered to be
extraterritorially a part of the Vatican City-State, as is the basilica
Santa Maria Maggiore (St. Mary Major), which is located on Esquiline
Hill. This is the result of a treaty (Concordat) signed with the
Italian state in 1929 at the Lateran, which restored the diplomatic
status of the Vatican as an independent city-state, which had been lost
in 1860-1870 when Italy seized all papal territories. See <img

  <p>So anxious are the Catholics to place Peter in Rome, that they are
willing to permanently brand Rome with the symbolic title of Babylon in
the New Testament. Indeed, I would venture to say that <i>every</i>
Roman Catholic Bible published has a footnote identifying Babylon in 1
Peter 5:13 as actually meaning Rome. Regarding references to Babylon in
Revelation 14:8, 16:19, 17:5, 18:2, 10, and 21; note the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"These references cannot be to the onetime capital of the
Babylonian Empire. That Babylon had been reduced to an inconsequential
status by the march of years, military defeat, and political
subjugation; it was no longer a 'great city'. It played no important
part in the recent history of the ancient world. The only truly 'great
city' in New Testament times was Rome."</p>

verse describing Mystery Babylon:</p>
  <blockquote>

  <p>The Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church historically claims
authority over all secular rulers, and has exercised that assumed
authority by deposing kings or queens who did not acknowledge the
Pope's superior secular and ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Here are just a few examples of this claimed authority over
Kings:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There are two powers, august Emperor, by which this world is
chiefly ruled, namely, the sacred authority of the priests and the
royal power. Of these that of the priests is the more weighty, since
they have to render an account for even the kings of men in the divine
judgment. You are also aware, dear son, that while you are permitted
honorably to rule over human kind, yet in things divine you bow your
head humbly before the leaders of the clergy and await from their hands
the means of your salvation. In the reception and proper disposition of
the heavenly mysteries you recognize that you should be subordinate
rather than superior to the religious order, and that in these matters
you depend on their judgment rather than wish to force them to follow

royal power. Furthermore, the moon derives her light from the sun, and
is in truth inferior to the sun in both size and quality, in position
as well as effect. In the same way the royal power derives its dignity
from the pontifical authority: and the more closely it cleaves to the

    <p>&nbsp;[A letter from Innocent to the Duke of Zähringen
justifying his intervention in a disputed election of the kingship of
the Romans.]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;... We acknowledge, as we are bound, that the right and
authority to elect a king (later to be elevated to the Imperial throne)
belongs to those princes to whom it is known to belong by right and
ancient custom; especially at this right and authority came to them
from the Apostolic See, which transferred the Empire from the Greeks to
the Germans in the person of Charles the Great. But the princes should
recognize, and assuredly do recognize, that the right and authority to
examine the person so elected king (to be elevated to the Empire)
belongs to us who anoint, consecrate and crown him. For it is a
generally observed rule that the examination of a person belongs to him
who has the duty of the laying-on of hands. For suppose that the
princes elected a sacrilegious man or an excommunicate, a tyrant or an
imbecile, a heretic or a pagan; and that not just by a majority, but
unanimously, are we bound to anoint, consecrate and crown such a
person? Of course not....<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is evident from law and custom that when in
an election the votes of the princes are divided we may, after due
warning and a fitting interval, favour one of the parties.... For if
after such due notice the princes cannot or will not agree, will not
the Apostolic See be without an advocate and defender, and thus be
punished for their fault?</p>

    <p align="center"><i>Extract from Gregory VII's Letter to the
Bishop of Metz,</i><br>
1081 Doeberl, op. cit. iii. 40 sqq. Mirbt, No. 297</p>
    <p>... who can doubt but that the priests of Christ are to be
considered the fathers and masters of kings and princes and of all the
faithful? ...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;... For, indeed, one can see how the necks of kings and
princes are bowed before the knees of priests; and how, having kissed
their right hands, they believe themselves strengthened by their
prayers. ...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore every Christian King, when
he comes to die, seeks as a pitiful supplicant the aid of a priest,
that he may escape hell's prison, may pass from the darkness into the
light, and at the judgment of God may appear absolved from the bondage
of his sins. Who, in his last hour (what layman, not to speak of
priests), has ever implored the aid of an earthly king for the
salvation of his soul? And what king or emperor is able, by reason of
the office he holds, to rescue a Christian from the power of the devil
through holy baptism, to number him among the sons of God, and to
fortify him with the divine unction? Who of them can by his own words
make the body and blood of our Lord, - the greatest act in the
Christian religion? Or who of them possesses the power of binding and
loosing in heaven and on earth? From all of these considerations it is
clear how greatly the priestly office excels in power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who of them can ordain a single clerk in the holy
Church, much less depose him for any fault? For in the orders of the
Church a greater power is needed to depose than to ordain. Bishops may
ordain other bishops, but can by no means depose them without the
authority of the apostolic see. Who, therefore, or even moderate
understanding, can hesitate to give priests the precedence over kings?
Then, if kings are to be judged by priests for their sins, by whom can
they be judged with better right than by the Roman Pontiff?</p>

translated in the Catholic Douay Rheims reads "ALL KINGS SHALL SERVE

daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians (1 Ki 16:31). The name
Ethbaal means <i>man of Baal </i>(H854 + H1168), and Jezebel means <i>woman
of Baal</i> (H802 + H1168).</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1 Ki 16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the
sight of the LORD above all that were before him.<br>
1 Ki 16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him
to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife
Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and
served Baal, and worshipped him.<br>
1 Ki 16:32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,
which he had built in Samaria.<br>
1 Ki 16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before
him.</p>

  <p>Now note this passage in Revelation 2:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee,
because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication,
and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.<br>
Rev 2:21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
repented not.<br>
Rev 2:22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their
deeds.<br>
Rev 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I
will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In prophecy a woman represents a church, and Jezebel here
represents the apostate church, who has taught corrupted doctrine,
which is described as fornication, just as in Revelation 17:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will
show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many
waters:<br>
Rev 17:2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of
her fornication.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, pay close attention to this ...<br>
The apostate church in Revelation 2:20 (Jezebel, the woman of Baal)
calls herself <i>a prophetess</i> ... <b>so by her own admission she
is linked with prophecy! </b></p>
