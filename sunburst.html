  coat of arms as shown on the overview at right. Notice the animal on the left 
  side of the shield? That is a golden bull, the heraldic animal of the Borgia 
  family. It is more than just a little reminiscent of the golden calf the 
  Israelites made at Sinai. Sunbursts and images of golden bulls. How much more

    and love, let them continue to venerate, invoke and pray to the most Blessed

    she is solicitous about the whole human race. And since She has been 
    appointed by God to be the <b><em>Queen of heaven and earth</em></b>, and is 
    exalted above all the choirs of angels and saints, and even stands at the 
    right hand of her only-begotton Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, she presents our 
    petitions in a most efficacious manner. What she asks, she obtains. Her 
    pleas can never be unheard.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In 1954, Pope Pius XII officially declared Mary the Queen of Heaven.<br>
  Here is the full text of his encyclical <img src="star.gif" width="16" 
  height="12"> <b>
  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_11101954_ad-caeli-reginam_en.html">
  AD CAELI REGINAM</a>.</b></p>
  <p>There has been a complete substitution of Mary for Jesus, in the work of 
  our salvation, and in whom we pray to in times of need. The impression is that 
  Mary will listen, but God is cold and unapproachable. Mary will grant your 
  wishes, when God might otherwise reject them, and God is bound by the will of 
  Mary. Salvation is obtained from Mary and God will rubberstamp her decisions. 
  There is a word for this, it is AntiChrist. (The word anti means in place of, 
  or substitution, as well as against.)</p>
  <p>Another place this can be found is in The Dogmatic Constitution on the 
  Church (LUMEN GENTIUM) by Pope Paul VI, November 21, 1964, paragraph 59- 
  (emphasis is mine)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... Finally, the Immaculate Virgin, preserved free from all guilt of 
    original sin, on the completion of her earthly sojourn, was taken up body 
    and soul into heavenly glory, and exalted by the Lord as <b><em>Queen of the 
    universe</em></b>, that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son, 
    the Lord of lords and the conqueror of sin and death.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The last part of that sentence (that she might be the more fully conformed 
  to her Son) can be rephrased as follows ... that she might be more like her 
  Son... As I said, this is plainly AntiChrist. This paragraph from LUMEN 
  GENTIUM was most recently quoted and reaffirmed in the Vatican's new 
  Catechism, paragraph 966.</p>

  <p>(NOTE: Official Roman Catholic Documents are usually published first in 
  Latin, and then later translated to other languages. Some translations can 
  vary slightly in their wording. Such is the case with paragraph 59 of LUMEN 
  GENTIUM. The printed document I have and the version available online at EWTN 
  are slightly different. One refers to Mary as Queen of the universe, the other

  </blockquote>
  <p>The Queen of Heaven, if you check in most any commentary, is none other 
  than Ishtar, Ashtoreth, or Astarte the very pagan goddess that Israel 
  worshipped when they fell into apostasy and paganism-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the apocryphal book of Baruch, which is considered to be inspired 
  scripture by the Catholic Church, we find a very interesting description of 
  the pagan practices of the Babylonians, who at the time held the Jews in 
  captivity. The following quotation is from the Catholic Douay Rheims Bible:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Baruch 6:3 But now, you shall see in Babylon gods of gold, and of silver, 
    and of stone, and of wood borne upon the shoulders, causing fear to the 
    Gentiles.<br>
    Baruch 6:4 Beware therefore that you imitate not the doings of others, and 
    be afraid, and the fear of them should seize upon you.<br>
    Baruch 6:5 But when you see the multitude behind, and before, adoring them, 
    say you in your hearts: Thou oughtest to be adored, O Lord.<br>
    Baruch 6:6 For my angel is with you: And I myself will demand an account of 
    your souls.<br>
    Baruch 6:7 For their tongue that is polished by the craftsman, and 
    themselves laid over with gold and silver, are false things, and they cannot 
    speak.<br>
    Baruch 6:8 And as if it were for a maiden that loveth to go gay: so do they 
    take gold and make them up.<br>
    Baruch 6:9 <b>Their gods have golden crowns upon their heads</b>; whereof 
    the priests secretly convey away from them gold, and silver, and bestow it 
    on themselves.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So clearly it was the practice of the pagan Babylonians to crown the 
  statues of their gods. This Pagan practice has also been adopted by the Roman 
  Catholic Church.</p>
  <p>Below you see John Paul II himself, bowing down and paying homage to 
  crowned statues of Mary, the &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;, in direct violation of the 
  Commandments of God:</p>

  pervasive in the various forms of Catholic religious imagery. The sunburst is 
  also referred to as an aureole, nimbus, or halo, and is a very common device 
  to designate divinity or holiness in various forms of religious art. A sun 
  worshipping pagan entering a Catholic cathedral for the first time would 
  immediately recognize his god, the sun, in virtually every painting or icon,

  <p><b><u>Catholics acknowledge the pagan origin of the aureole / nimbus / 
  halo:</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is a halo put on the head of a statue of a Saint, and 
    what is its symbolic meaning?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The halo, or circle, which is supposed to represent a ring of 
    light, is symbolic of the light of grace bestowed by God. It may be regarded 
    in art as the development of the aureole, the nimbus and the gloria.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The aureole is a cloud or glow of light in oval form surrounding 
    the whole figure. The nimbus is a cloud or glow of light around the head. 
    The gloria is light emanating from the body.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The halo or nimbus around the head of Christ is symbolic of His 
    divinity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pagans used such devices before the Christian Era to signify 
    power and majesty or prominence. Even in the Christian Era the symbols were 
    used for famous personages, but Pope Urban III (1623- 1644) forbade the use 
    of the nimbus for persons who are not at least beatified.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In the plastic arts (painting and sculpture) the symbolism of the nimbus 
    was early in use among the pagans who determined its form. In the monuments 
    of Hellenic and Roman art, the heads of the gods, heroes, and other 
    distinguished persons are often found with a disc-shaped halo, a circle of 
    light, or a rayed-fillet. They are, therefore, associated especially with 
    gods and creatures of light such as the Phoenix. The disc of light is 
    likewise used in the Pompeian wall paintings to typify gods and demigods 
    only, but later, in profane art it was extended to cherubs or even simple 
    personifications, and is simply a reminder that the figures so depicted are 
    not human. In the miniatures of the oldest Virgil manuscript all the great 
    personages wear a nimbus. The custom of the Egyptian and Syrian kings of 
    having themselves represented with a rayed crown to indicate the status of 
    demigods, spread throughout the East and the West. In Rome the halo was 
    first used only for deceased emperors as a sign of celestial bliss, but 
    afterwards living rulers also were given the rayed crown, and after the 
    third century, although not first by Constantine, the simple rayed nimbus. 
    Under Constantine the rayed crown appears only in exceptional cases on the 
    coin, and was first adopted emblematically by Julian the Apostate. 
    Henceforth the nimbus appears without rays, as the emperors now wished 
    themselves considered worthy of great honour, but no longer as divine 
    beings. In early Christian art, the rayed nimbus as well as the rayless disc 
    were adopted in accordance with tradition. The sun and the Phoenix received, 
    as in pagan art, a wreath or a rayed crown, also the simple halo. The latter 
    was reserved not only for emperors but for men of genius and 
    personifications of all kinds, although both in ecclesiastical and profane 
    art, this emblem was usually omitted in ideal figures. In other cases the 
    influence of ancient art tradition must not be denied.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>Judg 2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</p>
  <p>Baal worship is sun worship, and Ashtoreth / Ishtar / Astarte is the queen 
  of heaven. This is why there are so many sunburst images in Catholicism and 
  why Mary is called the Queen of heaven. It is the apostasy of idol worship of 
  Baal and Ashtaroth in the church - yet again.</p>
  <p>It is as true today as it was then, just with different names.</p>
