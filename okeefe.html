      <td>The following sermon by Rev. J. O'Keefe, a priest of some prominence 
      in the Roman Catholic diocese of Baltimore, Maryland, was first printed in 
      the July 3, 1897, issue of <i>Catholic Mirror,</i> the leading Catholic 
      paper in America, and the official organ of James Cardinal Gibbons. It was 
      reprinted that same month by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in a tract 
      entitled <i>Bible Student Library</i>, No. 150, dated July 1897 and was 
      again reprinted 100 years later in the magazine <b><i>

      <a href="http://www.hopeint.org/off/9707a.htm">Vol. 12, No. 7, July 1997</a></b>.
      <p>Apparently this sermon was based on a series of four editorials which 
      previously appeared in the <i>Catholic Mirror </i>on September, 2, 9, 16, 
      and 23, of 1893, which were also reprinted by the Seventh-day Adventist

  <p><u><font size="5"><i>Catholic Mirror&nbsp; </i>- July 3, 1897</font></u></p>
  <p><font size="6">O</font><font size="3">N last Sunday Rev. J. O'Keefe 
  delivered a sermon at St. John's<a href="#*">*</a> Church, which will be of 
  interest to our readers to reproduce in full. He spoke as follows:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3">&quot;But these men blaspheme whatever things they 
    know not; and what things soever they naturally know, like dumb beasts, in 
    these they are corrupted.&quot; (Jude 10).</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning paper of last Monday spread 
    before its readers a compendium of seven sermons delivered the day before, 
    by as many Baptist preachers, on the topic of [Sunday] Sabbath desecration. 
    This simultaneous concert of action was the result of previous arrangement.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is the duty of every citizen who 
    has at heart the public welfare to aid, as far as possible, in promoting the 
    diffusion of knowledge, and at the same time in the correction of error, I 
    feel I would be guilty of a gross injustice to my fellow citizens were I not 
    to furnish them with the exact truth, especially since false ideas are being 
    constantly promulgated by men either grossly and criminally ignorant of what 
    they should know, and who, assuming the office of public guides, convey 
    false information derived either from false premises, or inconsecutive 
    conclusions from the same, or, knowing better, maliciously and 
    unscrupulously abuse the influence they accidentally wield over simple and 
    unsophisticated people, by deliberately impregnating their ductile and 
    plastic minds with erroneous views that practically interfere with the 
    rational exercise of their liberty in the ordinary routine of life.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fifteenth chapter, tenth verse, 
    of the Acts of the Apostles, we read of a case in point. A sect of the 
    Pharisees gave much annoyance to the primitive Christians by requiring 
    circumcision and the full observance of the Mosaic law. Peter arose in the 
    assembly and asked, &quot;Now therefore, why tempt ye God, to put a yoke on the 
    necks of the disciples which neither our fathers, nor we have been able to 
    bear?&quot; (Acts 15:10). A sect of the same order of modern Pharisees, in their 
    self-righteousness, gave vent to their mock solicitude for the spiritual 
    welfare of their contemporaries by denouncing most emphatically the 
    practices of barrooms, cigars, tobacco, soda water, bicycles, confectionery, 
    parks, trolley cars, Sunday papers, reporters, ice-cream saloons, etc., 
    etc., on Sunday, with a highly commendable and virtuous indignation; but it 
    is my purpose to meet their crusade in the spirit of common sense, and ask 
    with St. Peter, &quot;Why, therefore, tempt ye God to put a yoke on the necks of 
    the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?&quot; And 
    this is precisely what these self-constituted guides of the people undertake 
    to do, when they assume to dictate into what is permitted and what is 
    forbidden on the Sabbath.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, just here, I boldly proclaim that 
    this meddlesome interference with the God-given liberties of our citizens is 
    an assumption of authority that has no warrant whatsoever in God's law, and 
    amounts to what may be truthfully designated an impertinent attempt at an 
    unauthorized despotism. For whilst the American people are tolerant of every 
    law, divine and human, that appeals to their reason, yet they must be 
    convinced that the ordinance has a divine or human sanction for the 
    enforcement of its obligations.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my purpose to submit to my fellow 
    citizens <b>the true grounds</b> for the obligation of cessation from labor 
    one day of the week, and of the duty of sanctifying the same day. The seven 
    reverend gentlemen who on last Sunday assumed to impose their views on their 
    fellow citizens anent [concerning] the question of [Sunday] Sabbath 
    desecration, have no warrant whatsoever for such imposition, save what can 
    be found in their acknowledged teacher, the Bible. Let us then open the 
    pages of this guide and teacher, and learn from it the commands of God on 
    this point. We are at least equally intelligent with them in construing the 
    expressed will of God, in drawing rational conclusions, and in inferring 
    conclusively the correctness or falsity of their claim to impose their views 
    on us.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first intimation that reaches us of 
    God's will on this important point is found in Genesis 2:2: &quot;And on the 
    seventh day He [God] rested . . . from all His work which He had made.&quot; And 
    it is conclusive that the patriarchs under the immediate direction of God, 
    continued, by oral tradition, the same observance of God's Sabbath, until He 
    gave through Moses the same commandment by written tradition (Exodus 
    20:8-11), &quot;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;&quot; and the sacred text 
    informs us He did so command <i>for that reason</i>, viz.: &quot;<i>Therefore</i> 
    the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and sanctified it.&quot; (Exodus 20:11). Again, 
    the Lord calls the Sabbath &quot;a perpetual covenant.&quot; (Exodus 31:16).</font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more, we will refer to the most 
    positive repetition of this command: &quot;Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt 
    do all thy work. The seventh is the day of the Sabbath, that is, the rest of 
    the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not do any work therein,&quot; etc. (Deuteronomy 
    5:13-14)</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a careful examination of the Old 
    Testament, we find this reference to the Sabbath 126 times. And now it is 
    incumbent on us to ascertain <b>which is the seventh day</b> on which God 
    rested, and which He blessed and sanctified: which day, also, He designated 
    as &quot;a perpetual covenant.&quot; The answer to this question is furnished by the 
    Hebrew race, who all through the patriarchal age to Moses' day, over 2,500 
    years, thence from Moses 2514 A.M. [B.C.] to A.D. 1897, a period of 5,897 
    years, have scrupulously kept every Saturday, from the days of Adam, who 
    walked with God, through the days of the patriarchs, the law, and the 
    prophets, and through the full period of the New Law to yesterday 
    [Saturday]. Thus the Hebrew race form a living historical chain of nearly 
    5,900 annual links — a perpetual, living testimony of God's rest (His 
    Sabbath) to today, through oral and written tradition. Therefore, if the 
    testimony of men could ever be regarded as an infallible motive of 
    credibility, it must be recognized as such in the constant weekly keeping of 
    God's [Saturday] Sabbath synchronous with time itself.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Testament is also, from the 
    days of Moses, the living witness of this undeniable fact, sustained by the 
    oral living testimony of the Hebrew people to the advent of the Messiah. To 
    deny this effectively, it would be necessary to destroy the Jewish people 
    and the Old Testament.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having placed beyond the reach of all 
    successful denial; the grand historical fact that up to the coming of the 
    Messiah, the Lord's Sabbath — that of the seventh day — was <i>alone</i> 
    recognized and kept, from the last day of Creation to the coming of the 
    Messiah — this by the positive precept of God in the Old Law and the 
    ever-living testimony and practice of the Hebrew race, it now behooves us to 
    trace the history of this arrangement to date, or as far, at least, as the 
    apostolic records testify under the New Law. On approaching this period, 
    involving as it does an era of nearly nineteen full centuries, we naturally 
    inquire whether a divine statute, which God Himself was pleased to designate 
    a &quot;perpetual covenant,&quot; continued to be observed by the people of Israel and 
    Christians collectively; that is, whether the day enjoined by God (Saturday) 
    has always been kept by Christians and Jews collectively for these nineteen 
    centuries, or, if not, where in the pages of the New Testament is found<b> a 
    divine decree</b> canceling the mandate of the Old Law, and at the same time 
    specifying the day to substitute [for] Saturday. For inasmuch as Saturday 
    was ordered to be kept by divine authority, so, also, divine authority, 
    under the form of a canceling decree, is absolutely necessary to do away 
    with Saturday, and another decree emanating from the same divine source is 
    equally necessary to appoint another Sabbath. A close and critical 
    examination of the New Testament is now necessary to discover these two 
    decrees — the one canceling Saturday, the other selecting another day to 
    replace it.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hebrew Sabbath, or Saturday, is 
    referred to in the New Testament 61 times. In the four Gospels the same 
    Sabbath (Saturday) is mentioned 51 times. We find that the Saviour during 
    life constantly adopted the same day to teach in the synagogues and to work 
    miracles.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one instance, quoted by Matthew and 
    Luke He designated Himself the &quot;<a name="Lord of the Sabbath">Lord of the 
    Sabbath</a>;&quot; <sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#1"><b>1</b></a>]</sup> but to the 
    last hour of His life He utilized that day and gives no indication of a 
    desire to change it. After His crucifixion, His apostles and personal 
    friends kept it (Saturday) strictly, whilst yet in the tomb; that St. Luke 
    informs us of: &quot;And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and 
    rested <i>on the Sabbath day according to the commandment</i>.&quot; (23:56) And 
    having strictly kept the Sabbath, as St. Luke has just now described, they 
    felt themselves free to commence the new week with the corporal work of 
    mercy, viz., embalming the body of their Master.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This proceeding is quoted by St. Luke 
    in the next verse: &quot;And on <i>the first day</i> of the week, very early in 
    the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices they had 
    prepared.&quot; (24:1) Can anything be more conclusive than that up to the day of 
    Christ's death, from St. Luke's testimony?</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus we are forced from all we read in 
    the Gospels to conclude that the &quot;Lord of the Sabbath,&quot; as Christ calls 
    Himself, <b>never kept during his mortal life any</b> <b>other Sabbath than 
    Saturday</b>, testifying His respect for it on several occasions by His 
    severe rebukes to the scribes and Pharisees for their fanatical mode of 
    keeping it; and after His death the apostles, and the holy women, who were 
    the best exponents of His will, <i>followed His example by doing on Sunday 
    what the commandment forbade them to do on Saturday</i>. It is then 
    undeniable that the Jewish Saturday was alone kept by the Saviour, His 
    apostles, and friends up to the period of His death, covering thirty-three 
    years of the Christian era.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come we now to examine the history of 
    this interesting question for thirty years more after Christ's death, as 
    recorded by the evangelist St. Luke, in his Acts of the Apostles. Surely we 
    must find some trace of the canceling act during this period involving a 
    lifetime. But, alas! not a vestige of it can be discovered; and what is 
    worse, we find in the nine passages referred to in the Acts of the Apostles 
    that they invariably kept Saturday. I shall quote them: &quot;They . . . went 
    into the synagogue <i>on the Sabbath day</i>, . . . . And after the reading 
    of the law and the prophets,&quot; etc. (Acts 13:14-15). Again, verse 27: &quot;For 
    they. . . because they knew Him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets 
    which <i>are read every Sabbath,</i>&quot; etc. Behold here the testimony of St. 
    Paul to the practice of reading the Scriptures <i>every Sabbath</i>. He does 
    not say &quot;were read,&quot; but &quot;are read,&quot; thus bearing witness to a time-honored 
    practice.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, verse 42: &quot;And when the Jews had 
    gone out, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them
    <i>the next Sabbath</i>,&quot; not the next Sunday. Observe next how the Greeks 
    or Gentiles kept the Sabbath with the Jews: <i>&quot;And the next Sabbath</i> 
    came almost the whole city to hear the Word of God.&quot; (verse 44<i>) Not 
    Sunday</i>, but the Sabbath still!</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once more: James, the apostle, publicly 
    says: &quot;Men and brethren, hear now to me. . . . For Moses of old time hath in 
    every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues <i>every 
    Sabbath day</i>.&quot; (Acts 15:13, 21) No vestige of a change to Sunday yet. 
    Again: &quot;And Paul, <i>as his manner was</i>, went unto them, <i>and three 
    Sabbath days</i> reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.&quot; (Acts 17:2) And, 
    to cap the climax and exhaust all scriptural resources: &quot;And he [Paul] 
    reasoned in the synagogue <i>every Sabbath</i>, and persuaded the Jews and 
    the Greeks.&quot; (Acts 18:4)</font> </p>
    <p><b><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it is absolutely certain that 
    neither our Lord during His life of thirty-three years, nor His apostles for 
    thirty years subsequently, ever kept any Sabbath save Saturday.</font></b>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, before I close my argument, I 
    propose to answer the argument of the apologists for <b>the change of day</b> 
    not to be found in the New Testament. Their arguments are grounded on the 
    words &quot;the Lord's day&quot; and &quot;the day of the Lord,&quot; as the drowning man grasps 
    a straw. The first of these (Acts 2:20): &quot;The sun shall be turned into 
    darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the 
    Lord shall come.&quot; Is this Sunday? Again: &quot;Who shall also confirm you unto 
    the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; (1 
    Corinthians 1:8) Who is silly enough to interpret these words of Sunday? 
    Again: &quot;To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that 
    the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:5) 
    Is this Sunday? Again: &quot;And I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end . . 
    . even as ye also are ours<i> in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ</i>.&quot; (2 
    Corinthians 1:13-14) Is this day Sunday or the day of judgment? Whilst once 
    more: &quot;Being confident of this very thing that He who hath begun a good work 
    in you will perform it <i>until the day of Jesus Christ</i>.&quot; (Philippians 
    1:6) Until next Sunday, of course! Sixth text: &quot;That ye may be sincere and 
    without offense till the day of Christ.&quot; (Philippians 1:10)&nbsp; Till next 
    Sunday, forsooth! Seventh text: &quot;But <i>the day of the Lord</i> will come as 
    a thief in the night.&quot; (2 Peter 3:10) Sunday next! Eighth text: &quot;Looking out 
    for and hastening unto the coming of <i>the day of the Lord</i>, wherein the 
    heavens being on fire, shall be dissolved.&quot; (2 Peter 3:12) Look out for the 
    fireworks on [next] Sunday, if not too late today [Sunday]!</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have thus disposed of eight of nine 
    texts from the apostolic writings which the apologists for the change of day 
    grounded on the words, &quot;the day of the Lord,&quot; &quot;the Lord's day,&quot; &quot;the day of 
    Christ,&quot; and shown the absurdity of their application to Sunday, referring 
    in each instance to the day of judgment. There is a ninth, and the only one 
    left which does not bear its own interpretation like the others. St. John 
    says, &quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day.&quot; (Revelation 1:10) The rule of 
    analogy, a certain motive of judging whereby we are enabled to conclude with 
    certainty of an unknown quantity from the known, applies here unqualifiedly. 
    Eight texts, of a similar form and character to a ninth, have been shown to 
    unite in one meaning exclusively. Dialecticians conclude that the ninth must 
    be so interpreted. Or, to present a more intelligible example from physical 
    laws: Eight stones thrown into the air fall by the law of gravity to the 
    surface; the ninth it is conclusive must obey the same law. Hence the words 
    of St. John admit of the same interpretation by analogy as the eight 
    preceding texts.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any attempt to interpret the above 
    texts, the day of the Lord or the Lord's day, as meaning Sunday, is 
    therefore absurd. And what will confirm this reasoning beyond all doubt is 
    the language of the same St. John in two passages in his Gospels; speaking 
    of Sunday (Easter) he does not say, &quot;on the Lord's day,&quot; But, &quot;on the first 
    day of the week&quot; (John 20:1): and speaking of the following Sunday, he does 
    not designate it &quot;the Lord's day,&quot; but, &quot;Now when it was late that same day<i>, 
    the first of the week</i>.&quot; (chapter 20:19) This disposes forever of St. 
    John's, &quot;I was in the spirit on the Lord's day,&quot; (Revelation 1:10) 
    interpreted as Sunday.</font> </p>
    <p><b><font size="4">A False Supposition</font></b> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude my proofs, I propose to 
    call attention to and reply to an argument that would suppose a change of 
    day. Five times the first day of the week is referred to as being the day 
    substituted for the Sabbath in five passages of the Gospel, Acts, and 
    Epistles. St. Luke 24:33-40 and St. John 20:19 both refer to the meetings of 
    Jesus with the apostles on Easter Sunday. This would appear to furnish a 
    clue to the substitution of Saturday; but the texts themselves record <b>the 
    motive of their</b> <b>meeting</b>. It was not for prayer, for exhortation, 
    or reading of the Scriptures, but they were huddled together in that room 
    &quot;for fear of the Jews,&quot; as St. John tells us.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third occasion was the meeting of 
    Christ arisen with the eleven (including Thomas), for the purpose of 
    confounding the incredulity of Thomas, as St. John assures us (chapter 
    20:26-29). there is not a word to be found in these texts of prayer, praise, 
    or reading of the Scriptures. Again, &quot;The apostles were all of one accord in 
    one place&quot; (Acts 2:1) on the feast of Pentecost (Sunday). Nor can this 
    fourth instance of meeting on Sunday afford the slightest hope of finding an 
    escape; for Pentecost was the fiftieth day from the Passover, which was 
    called the Sabbath of weeks, consisting of seven times seven days; and the 
    day after the seventh weekly Sabbath was the chief day in the entire 
    festival, necessarily Sunday, which had been kept by the Jews annually for 
    over 15 centuries before Christianity. This was over a festival, and no 
    comfort can be derived from its introduction in favor of a change of day, 
    from the sacred volume.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the apologists for the change of 
    day call attention to Acts 20:7: &quot;And upon the first day of the week, when 
    the disciples came together <i>to break bread</i>,&quot; etc. the application of 
    the axiom in logic, &quot;Quod probat nimis, probat nihil&quot; (What proves too much, 
    proves nothing), puts a quietus on this text when I introduce words from the 
    Acts: &quot; And they continuing <i>daily . . .</i> in the temple, and <i>
    breaking bread</i> from house to house,&quot; etc., (2:46) which shows that this 
    was <i>a daily practise</i> which is claimed in this instance for Sunday.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly and finally, we are invited to 
    1 Corinthians 16:1-2: &quot;Now concerning the collection for the saints. . . . 
    On the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store,&quot; 
    etc. Presuming that this was done as St. Paul requested, I will call your 
    attention to what was <i>regularly </i>done the day before (Saturday) and 
    contrast the acts of each day. I have already quoted St. Paul's testimony of 
    the practise of reading the Scriptures &quot;<i>every Sabbath day</i>.&quot; (Acts 
    13:27)</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What more absurd conclusion than to 
    infer that the reading of the Scriptures, exhortation, and praying, which 
    formed the routine duties of every Saturday, or Sabbath, were overslaughed, 
    by a request to take up a collection, on a particular occasion, another day 
    of the week? Which occupation was more in keeping with the service of the 
    Lord's day?</font> </p>
    <p><b><font size="4">The Summing Up</font></b> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having placed before you all the 
    references in the sacred writings — Gospels, Acts, and Epistles — I will now 
    sum up the result of my examination of the relative use of the Sundays and 
    Saturdays from these same records, constituting the New Testament, and 
    covering a period of over 60 years. Every Sabbath, or Saturday, was kept, 
    according to the record, 3,276 times by Christ and His apostles, whilst the 
    beggarly record of the Sunday meetings by the apostles number <i>five </i>
    within the same period, viz., Easter Sunday comes first; next, [the] Sunday 
    when Thomas was converted; but not a prayer, nor reading of the Scripture, 
    nor preaching on either occasion; Pentecost Sunday, a part of the ceremonial 
    law of the Jews kept for 1,500 years before; the Sunday referred to in Acts 
    20:7, where the breaking of bread alone is referred to, but which in Acts 
    2:46 is designated a daily work; and fifthly, collection Sunday (1 
    Corinthians 16:1-2) has no vestige of prayer, reading of Scripture, sermon, 
    or any other act of divine worship connected with it. Add to these, nine 
    references to the &quot;Lord's day;&quot; &quot;the day of the Lord,&quot; &quot;the day of Christ,&quot; 
    mentioned nine times, each one of which refers, as I have proved, to the day 
    of judgment, and you have every vestige of any claim that might be made of a 
    change of day from Saturday during the period of over 60 years from the dawn 
    of Christianity.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this truthful and exhaustive 
    exposition before us, based in the Sacred Writings, and against which I defy 
    successful contradiction, let us apply our valuable information practically 
    to the existing position of Protestantism and its relative bearing on 
    Judaism, because they both acknowledge the same teacher, the Bible, with 
    this difference, however, whilst the Jew's teacher, the Old Testament, 
    closes with the Messiah's coming, the Biblical Christian has the New 
    Testament superadded to the Old, whilst he enjoys the teaching and practise 
    of the Saviour together with those of the apostles for over 60 years, and 
    all these<i> in</i> <i>perfect conformity</i> with the Old Testament. For 
    whilst the Jewish people — patriarchs, law, and prophets — have, after the 
    example of God Himself, kept &quot;the Sabbath of the Lord&quot; for nearly 6,000 
    years, up to yesterday [Saturday], the New Testament, the supplemental 
    teacher of Protestantism, testifies to the positive teachings of the Saviour, 
    &quot;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;&quot; and His life and those of the 
    apostles, as we learn from the Sacred Record, were in perfect keeping with 
    the practise of the Jewish people. Today, however, so-called followers of 
    Christ, (who was Himself to the hour of His death an obedient follower of 
    the law of the Sabbath), in direct contradiction of the law and the Gospel, 
    have for over three centuries raised the flag of revolt against this 
    &quot;perpetual covenant.&quot; as God Himself is pleased to call it, and for fully 10 
    generations not one representative of Protestant Christianity, with a 
    feigned and hypocritical affection of respect for his teacher, the Bible, 
    has <i>once</i> kept the day ordered to be kept over 160 times by the Old 
    Testament and over 60 times by the New.</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more transparent contradiction</b>, 
    involving millions of human beings, does not exist in the earth today — a 
    teacher, assumed to be of divine origin by its disciples — utterly ignored, 
    and the voice of God Himself echoing in every page, as they profess to 
    believe, utterly disregarded by every Protestant Christian on earth today, 
    for <a name="not one">not one</a> <sup>[</sup><a href="#2"><sup><b>2</b></sup></a><sup>]</sup> 
    of them has once obeyed His command to keep His Sabbath, during life. 
    Christ, as their teacher, informs them, &quot;If thou wilt enter into life, keep 
    the commandments,&quot; and the chief and most emphatic of these is, &quot;<i>Remember 
    the Sabbath day</i>.&quot;</font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewing the situation from a 
    common-sense standpoint it is almost incredible that men endowed with 
    average intelligence could consent to occupy before the world, for an hour, 
    such a self-stultifying, self-contradictory position as this. Professing to 
    adore God, professing to obey His commands, yet they stand today before 
    heaven and earth, with His Written Word clasped to their breast, and which 
    they profess to obey, the most pronounced Sabbath-breakers on earth.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jew is rational; he obeys his 
    teacher, the Bible, pointing to the command, &quot;Keep holy the Sabbath;&quot; the 
    Catholic is ever rational, he obeys the teacher appointed him by Christ [the 
    Church]; but the Protestant <i>obeys neither God nor his teacher, the Bible</i>. 
    Thus I have in this sermon shown his utter abandonment of his professed 
    teacher, the Bible, and his public apostasy from the positive injunctions of 
    God, speaking to him through it; but he had descended to a still lower depth 
    of degradation. Having abandoned the teachings of his Bible, and having 
    poured out the vials of his apparently honest indignation against the 
    Catholic Church, all his life he is found today, after having consummated 
    his apostasy from his own religious principles and teacher, knocking at the 
    door of the Catholic Church to notify her<i> that he is about to borrow her 
    day</i>; thus this traitor to his professed teacher and guide throws open 
    the doors of his meetinghouse on each Sunday with a notice overhead, &quot;<b>OPEN 
    EVERY ROMAN SABBATH.' 'CLOSED EVERY BIBLE SABBATH</b>,' whilst the notice on 
    every synagogue on Saturday reads, &quot;<b>OPEN TO-DAY, THE BIBLE SABBATH</b>.&quot; 
    Nor does his unscrupulous treachery to his Bible end here; but with insolent 
    swagger and cool effrontery, like Cain, addressing his descendants on 
    brotherly love, with the broad brand of murderer on his brow; like Judas 
    moralizing on deicide; like the squatter who insolently intrudes himself; 
    and like the robber glorying in his ill-gotten goods; in a word, like Satan 
    rebuking sin, he inveighs, through his seven clerical drummers, against 
    barrooms, cigars, tobacco, soda water, bicycles, confectionery, parks, 
    trolley cars, Sunday papers, reporters, ice-cream saloons, etc., etc., 
    whilst there is not a living representative of these different avocations 
    whose records before the bar of reason, religion, and God are not 
    comparatively immaculate when contrasted with the record of these very 
    people who stand before God, reason, and religion <i>as the most inveterate 
    Sabbath-breakers on earth.</i></font> </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before closing this discourse, I 
    publicly invite those seven reverends, and all their confederate 
    Sabbath-breakers, <i>to purge themselves from the above imputation</i>.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I predict with absolute certainty 
    that the seven eloquent orators of last Sunday will be mute and dumb next 
    and future Sundays on this subject.</font> </p>

  <p><font size="3">In the foregoing paper we do not adopt nor do we commend the 
  harshness, sharpness, or acerbity of language in which Mr. O'Keefe has set 
  forth the two solemn facts: (1) That the only Bible Sabbath is the seventh 
  day; and (2) that for first-day sacredness or observance there is no Bible 
  warrant. We would that these facts had been told in a milder manner, in 
  language which it seems to us would be more consonant with the Gospel of 
  Christ; but we beg the Protestant reader to forget the acidity of the writing, 
  and weight the solemn facts in the light of the Bible and the judgment.<br>
