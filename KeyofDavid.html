  <title>THE KEY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID</title>
</head>
<body>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">THE KEY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>The first mention of the key of the house of David is found in the
book of Isaiah, in a description of the duties of Eliakim, the royal
chamberlain of King Hezekiah of Judah:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 22:20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will
call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:<br>
Isa 22:21 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
thy girdle, and I will commit thy <u>government</u> into his hand: and
he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house
of Judah.<br>
Isa 22:22 And <u>the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
shoulder</u>; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut,
and none shall open.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The key of the house of David is <i>upon his shoulder</i>? What
does that mean? Let Isaiah explain. Speaking about Jesus, Isaiah says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and
    <u>the government shall be upon his shoulder</u>: and his name
shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
Father, The Prince of Peace.<br>
Isa 9:7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and
to <u> establish it with judgment and with justice</u> from henceforth
even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The key of the house of David is symbolic for <u>the government</u>
of Eliakim in Isaiah 22 (v.21), which is a type or symbol of the
government of Jesus Christ as described in Isaiah 9. Note also that
according to Isaiah, the government or kingdom of Jesus Christ is
established, or founded, <i><u>on a work of judgment</u>.</i> This is
an important aspect of the key of the house of David, which will be
explained.</p>
  <div align="center"><u><b>THE DOORS OPENED BY THE KEY OF DAVID</b></u></div>
  <blockquote> </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">T</font>he key of the house of David,
possessed by Jesus, opens two important doors. John the Revelator sees
the first door opened in chapter 4:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 4:1 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in
heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will show thee
things which must be hereafter.<br>
Rev 4:2 And immediately I was in the spirit; and, behold, a throne was
set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"> <img src="TABERNACLE.gif" border="0" height="415"
 width="592"><br>
  <b>TABERNACLE OF MOSES</b></p>
  <p>In the traveling Tabernacle of Moses, there were two
"doors".&nbsp; Through the first door was the Holy Place, the first
apartment.This is the door opened first chronologically in
Revelation 4:1, in the <i>heavenly</i> Tabernacle, with the key of
David. The scene that John sees in heaven after the door is opened, is
a throne room:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 5:6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of
the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had
been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven
Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.<br>
Rev 5:7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that
sat upon the throne.<br>
...<br>
Rev 5:11 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was
ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</p>
  </blockquote>
In this scene, the one on the throne is God the Father, and the Lamb as
it had been slain is Jesus, returning to His Father from His
crucifixion. There is a book or scroll with seven seals which only
Jesus as the slain Lamb can open, and the seals are opened in sequence
from Rev. 6:1 to 8:1. Christ as the sacrificed Lamb is the only one
qualified to receive the title deed to the Kingdom, containing the
names of all the saved, the Lamb's book of life. The type of this in
the Old Testament is the kinsman redeemer Boaz, who by purchasing the
land of Naomi, also took Ruth as his wife. Jesus is our kinsman
redeemer, who by His sacrifice bought back ownership of the earth,
which Adam had forfeited to Satan at the fall. By this, Jesus also
takes those faithful believer's He has redeemed as His bride, restoring
to them their inheritance.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalms 37:22 (KJV)&nbsp; For such as be blessed of
him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be
cut off.<br>
  <p align="center"><u><b>THE SEVEN CHURCHES</b></u></p>
  <p>In Revelation, we find letters to seven churches in Asia Minor.
These seven churches, while they were literal congregations, they are
also understood to be a description of a spectrum of seven conditions
any church can find itself in. They are also considered symbolic for
seven consecutive periods of time, from the Apostolic church to the
time of the second coming as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Ephesus</b> ("desirable"), Rev. 2:1-7<font
 face="Times New Roman"> —</font> The Apostolic church of the 1st
century.<br>
    <b>Smyrna</b> ("sweet smelling"), Rev. 2:8-11<font
 face="Times New Roman"> —</font> Persecuted by Ancient Pagan Rome.<br>
    <b>Pergamos</b> ("elevated by marriage"), Rev. 2:12-17<font
 face="Times New Roman"> —</font> Apostate church-state union.<br>
    <b>Thyatira</b> ("sacrifice of contrition"), Rev. 2:18-29 <font
 face="Times New Roman">— </font>The church of the middle ages.<br>
    <b>Sardis</b> ("escape of the remnant"), Rev. 3:1-6<font
 face="Times New Roman"> —</font> The Reformation era.<br>
    <b>Philadelphia</b> ("brotherly love"), Rev. 3:7-13 <font
 face="Times New Roman">— </font>The early 19th century to 1844.<br>
    <b>Laodicea</b> ("<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">a
people judged</span>"), Rev. 3:14-19 <font face="Times New Roman">—
From 1844 to the second coming.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From Strong's Concordance:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>G2993.</b> Laodikeia,
lah-od-ik'-i-ah; from a comp. of G2992 and G1349; Laodicia, a place in
Asia Minor:--Laodicea.</font></li>
      <li> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>G2992.</b> laos, lah-os';
appar. a prim. word; a people (in gen.; thus differing from G1218,
which denotes one's own populace):--people.</font></li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>G1349.</b> dike, dee'-kay;
prob. from G1166; right (as self-evident), i.e. justice (the principle,
a decision, or its execution):--judgment, punish, vengeance. [The word
dike is used in Acts 25:15, Acts 28:4, 2 Thess 1:9, and Jude 1:7.]</font></li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <font face="Times New Roman">The church of Philadelphia, very near
the end of time, has another door opened for it:<br>
  </font>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 3:7 (KJV)&nbsp; <span style="color: red;">And
to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he
that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that
openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;</span><br>
Rev 3:8 (KJV)<font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font> <font
 color="red">I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open
door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast
kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="red"><font color="black">This door is the second, the
veil or door from the Holy Place into the Most Holy. </font></font>On
the Day of
Atonement the high priest entered the Most Holy apartment of the
Sanctuary or Temple, which was symbolic of the judgment of God's
people. In the Most Holy was the Ark of the Covenant, containing the
standard of judgment, the Ten Commandments of God (Exo. 20:2-17).<font
 color="red"><font color="black"> The last of the seven churches is
called Laodicea "a people judged" because they are living in the time
of the judgment. This event is also described in
Daniel:<br>
  </font></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:9 I beheld till the thrones were <strike>cast down</strike>
[set in place], and the Ancient of days [God the Father] did sit, whose
garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool:
his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.<br>
Dan 7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The books being opened in the judgment are the evidence, to
include the Lamb's book of life (Rev. 3:5), which is Christ's last will
and testament:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 9:15 And for this cause he [Christ] is the mediator of the
new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the
transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are
called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.<br>
Heb 9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
death of the testator.<br>
Heb 9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it
is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the ancient world, a will (Praetorian Testament) was sealed
with the seals of <i>seven</i> witnesses to attest to the validity of
the will (see <i>A&nbsp;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities </i>edited
by William Smith, D.C.L., LL.D., published by John Murray, London,
1875, entry on <a
 href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Testamentum.html">
Testamentum</a>) The seven seals represent seven consecutive periods of
time from creation to the second coming, the whole span of human
existence. Those being judged are the professed people of God, those
who claim to be the heirs of Christ, the rightful inheritors of eternal
life:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 4:17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the
house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
them that obey not the gospel of God?</p>
    <p>Mat 19:29 <font color="#ff0000">And every one that hath
forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an
hundredfold, and <u>shall inherit everlasting life.</u></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice what is given to Jesus at the conclusion of this initial
phase of the judgment, known as the <a href="judgment.html">Pre-advent
Investigative Judgment:</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the
Son of man [Jesus] came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the
Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.<br>
Dan 7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion
is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom
that which shall not be destroyed.</p>
  </blockquote>
So, just as Isaiah said, the government of Jesus, the Kingdom of God,
begins with judgment. The key of the house of David opens the two doors
into the Most Holy place of the sanctuary, the Temple in heaven, to
begin the <a href="judgment.html"> Pre-advent Investigative Judgment</a>
of God's people. <br>
  <blockquote>Psa 122:1 A Song of degrees of David. I was glad when
they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.<br>
...<br>
Psa 122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
house of David.<br>
  </blockquote>
This second door into the Most Holy Place does not remain open
indefinitely:
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of
God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple,
till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At the conclusion of the pre-advent judgment, the door into the
Most Holy place is effectively closed, and probation has ended for all
men. With the seven last plagues falling on the wicked, Jesus' role as
the high priest ends, and he changes into His royal garments and
returns to Earth as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Rev. 19:16).</p>
