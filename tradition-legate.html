<blockquote>
  <p>Take note, first of all, that the above is represented as a &quot;foolproof 
  argument&quot;, and a &quot;Pickle&quot; of a dilemma for Protestants, which is presented as 
  ironclad support for Catholic oral Tradition. The only recourse left for the 
  sadly misguided <i>Bible Only</i> Protestant, we are told, is to prove Paul to 
  be teaching error. Could anything be more fatuous? Let's remove the blinders 
  of Catholic Tradition and quickly make relish of this alleged pickle.</p>
  <p>Paul, in chapter two of his second epistle to the Thessalonians, is 
  addressing a false teaching that had apparently arisen among that congregation: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus 
    Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,<br>
    2 Th 2:2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by 
    spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is 
    at hand.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This sets the context for the chapter, which is the second coming of 
  Christ.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not 
    come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be 
    revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
    2 Th 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or 
    that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing 
    himself that he is God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul makes clear in this letter to the Thessalonians, that the second 
  coming is <u>not</u> imminent, that first there must arise a &quot;man of sin&quot; in 
  the church. Anyone teaching that the return of Jesus was near, was teaching 
  error, a deceiver, not to be believed.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>2 Th 2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye 
  have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, <u>in context</u>, what is Paul referring to in verse 15?&nbsp; My, 
  what a pickle! Is Paul reminding the Thessalonians of his orally preaching the 
  Assumption of Mary? The Immaculate Conception of Mary? Mary Mediatrix of all 
  grace and Coredemptrix? 
  Papal Infallibility? How about Purgatory? Obviously not, when context is taken 
  into account.</p>
  <p>So, just what did Paul teach <i>orally</i> when 
  he was in Thessalonica? Do we have a clue?</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>2 Th 2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, <u>I told you 
  these things?</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><i>What things</i>?</u> In context again, had Paul orally taught the 
  Thessalonians a &quot;foolproof argument&quot; for 
  the Assumption of Mary? The Immaculate Conception of Mary? Mary Mediatrix of 
  all grace and Coredemptrix? 
  Papal Infallibility? How about Purgatory?&nbsp; <i>Any</i> of the doctrinal 
  oral Traditions of Catholicism? Clearly, no, <u>in context</u> he had not done 
  any such thing. The context of the chapter clearly demonstrates that the subject of Paul's 
  epistle, and his oral teaching as mentioned in verse 15, <i>and</i> verse 5, was the second coming of 
  Jesus - that it <i>must</i> be preceded by apostasy and the rise of antichrist in the church, 
  and that the Thessalonians should hold fast to <u>that</u> teaching, and not 
  be so easily misled by anyone into believing that Jesus' return was imminent.</p>

        <td width="100%"><em><strong>Frank responds...</strong></em><p>Hopefully 
        now those who have read the latest submission can see clearly enough to 
        recognize that Mr. Scheifler's answer is <b><i>NO</i></b> answer at all 
        but instead a typical dodge of the real issue at hand. </td>

  </div>
  <p>I have not dodged anything. It is obvious that 2nd Thessalonians 2:15 is being cited 
  in an effort to legitimize the dogmatic oral Traditions of the Roman Catholic 
  Church. These Traditions, Catholics maintain, were taught by the apostles but 
  never included in the inspired writings of scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>#81 &quot;Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in writing 
    under the breath of the Holy Spirit.&quot; And [Holy] Tradition transmits in its 
    entirety the Word of God which has been entrusted to the apostles by Christ 
    the Lord and the Holy Spirit. It transmits it to the successors of the 
    apostles so that, enlightened by the Spirit of truth, they may faithfully 
    preserve, expound, and spread it abroad by their preaching.</p>
    <p>#82 As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation 
    of Revelation is entrusted, &quot;does not derive her certainty about all 
    revealed truths from the Holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition 
    must be accepted and honored with equal sentiments of devotion and 
    reverence.&quot;</p>
    <p>#83 The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on 
    what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they learned 
    from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians did not yet have a 
    written New Testament, and the New Testament itself demonstrates the process 
    of living Tradition.</p>
    <p>Source: <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, published by Liguori 
    Publications, English translation copyright 1994 by the United States 
    Catholic Conference, Inc.--Libreria Editrice Vaticana, bearing the Imprimi 
    Potest of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, page 26.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Take note that what is being asserted there is that the Assumption of Mary and the 
  Immaculate Conception of Mary, to name two Traditions, <i>were taught by the 
  apostles</i>, and are to be accepted and believed because the Church declares them 
  authentic with an authority equal to that of inspired scripture. For one to 
  deny the <a href="http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9ineff.htm">Immaculate Conception of Mary</a>, we are told, is to have &quot;suffered 
  shipwreck in the faith; that he has separated from the unity of the Church&quot; 
  and <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">to reject the <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P12MUNIF.HTM">
  Assumption of Mary</a> is to have &quot;fallen away completely from the divine and 
  Catholic Faith&quot;. So to deny either of these unbiblical Catholic Traditions is to 
  be lost, according to supposedly infallible papal decrees. </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">That is the framework in which Roman 
  Catholics cite </font>2nd Thessalonians 2:15. However, when the chapter is examined, as I 
  have done previously, it is clear that the context involves the second coming, 
  apostasy, and the &quot;man of sin&quot;, and <i>that</i> is the teaching that 
  the Thessalonians are being told to stand fast in, and to hold, not dogmatic 
  Catholic Traditions.</p>

    </table>

  <p>Obviously not. As they were all selected and taught by Jesus Himself, the 
  apostles were authoritative in their teaching, regardless of mode. Who would 
  deny this?</p>

  </div>
  <p>The whole point of Catholics citing 2nd Thessalonians 2:15 in the first place is to 
  suggest that Paul taught dogmatic Catholic Traditions, though he never 
  mentions these Traditions in his letters.</p>

        only written traditions were to be adhered to.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>You apparently are trying to suggest that Sola Scriptura, when practiced, 
  somehow prevents preaching. It does not. To suggest that it does is a straw 
  man, a misrepresentation. No Protestant has ever defined Sola Scriptura in 
  this way.</p>
  <div align="center">

        <td width="100%">Are you implying that all these oral traditions which 
        Paul referred to were at some point written down? If so, please show us 
        this teaching <b>from the bible</b>.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Where does Catholic Tradition tell us specifically what Paul taught the 
  Thessalonians orally, when he was there, that was not included in scripture? 
  Just what did Paul preach? Where is Paul's preaching in Thessalonica to be 
  found? Can any Catholic present evidence of Paul teaching dogmatic oral 
  Catholic Traditions in Thessalonica? I dare say this cannot be done. In fact, 
  I would suggest that Catholics cannot provide evidence that any of the 
  Apostles ever taught the dogmatic Catholic Traditions, though we are told 
  these oral Traditions are as infallible and as authoritative as scripture.</p>
  <p>Clearly, in context, as mentioned previously, Paul in 2nd Thessalonians was reviewing <i>in writing</i> what he had 
  previously <i>preached 
  in person</i> in Thessalonica regarding the immanency of the second coming and 
  apostasy entering the church.</p>

    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Mr. Scheifler makes a point of stating that we must not take verses out of 
  context. He is correct. And like most Protestants, he believes that the Bible 
  must interpret itself, one verse shedding some light on another verse. But who 
  sets the bounds for context and who declares if one verse has anything at all 
  to do with another? Do we go one verse before the one in question, one 
  paragraph, one chapter? To truly take a verse in context, it must be 
  understood in light of the entire Word of God which includes the living 
  Tradition of the Church. Without this environment, you are no better than the 
  blind leading the blind. So just what are these traditions (plural) St. Paul 
  speaks of?<em><strong> I really don't think you have to go further than the 
  preceding verse</strong></em>! It is here where St. Paul specifies that these 
  traditions make up the gospel itself! &nbsp;And I think Mr. Scheifler would agree 
  that the gospel comprises much more than the subject of eschatology alone.<br>

      <tr>

        word, or by epistle of ours.</td>

  <p>Does Paul teach that the gospel includes Mary as the Mediatrix of all Grace, or 
  that she is Co-redemptrix? Does Paul teach the Immaculate Conception of Mary, 
  her Assumption, or that she is the Queen of Heaven? Does Paul teach us to pray 
  to Mary, or to dead saints? Can Catholics show us from their Tradition that 
  Paul ever taught these dogmas? No. The gospel of Rome and the gospel of scripture are quite different, and 
  Paul addresses this directly:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel 
  unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
  Gal 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other 
  gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Scheifler needs to tell us why he accepts 2 Thes as inspired and the 
  Word of God in the first place. To claim that Paul wrote it, isn't sufficient. 
  On what grounds can any &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; believer make this assertion? Paul 
  warns in 2 Thes 2:2 that there were fraudulent letters being passed around 
  claiming to be written by him. So how was a person to know for sure that a 
  letter truly was from Paul? 2 Thes 3:17 tells us how:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing 
    mark in all my letters. This is how I write. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Has Mr. Scheifler or anyone else seen with his own eyes any of the original 
  parchments written on by Paul? No. So how does he know for certain that Paul 
  wrote it and it isn't one of the spurious letters written by a phony? He 
  doesn't.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Furthermore, to check unbridled spirits, it [the Roman Catholic Church] 
    decrees that no one relying on his own judgment shall, in matters of faith 
    and morals pertaining to the edification of Christian Doctrine, distorting 
    the Holy Scriptures in accordance with his own conception, presume to 
    interpret them contrary to that sense which holy Mother Church, to whom it 
    belongs to judge of their true sense and interpretation, has held and holds, 
    or even contrary to the unanimous teaching of the Fathers, even though such 
    interpretations should never at any time be published. Those who act

    accordance with the penalties prescribed by the law. </p>
