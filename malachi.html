  <p>The following article (written long before the challenge) was submitted to 
  CAI on September 4th, 2002.</p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 1:6 (NIV) &quot;A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am 
    a father, where is the honor due me? If I am a master, where is the respect 
    due me?&quot; says the LORD Almighty. &quot;It is you, O priests, who show contempt 
    for my name. &quot;But you ask, 'How have we shown contempt for your name?'<br>
    Mal 1:7 &quot;You place defiled food on my altar. &quot;But you ask, 'How have we 
    defiled you?' &quot;By saying that the Lord's table is contemptible.<br>
    Mal 1:8 When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? When 
    you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong? Try offering 
    them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?&quot; 
    says the LORD Almighty.<br>
    Mal 1:9 &quot;Now implore God to be gracious to us. With such offerings from your 
    hands, will he accept you?&quot;--says the LORD Almighty.<br>
    Mal 1:10 &quot;Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would 
    not light useless fires on my altar! I am not pleased with you,&quot; says the 
    LORD Almighty, &quot;and I will accept no offering from your hands.<br>
    Mal 1:11 My name will be great among the nations, from the rising to the 
    setting of the sun. In every place incense and pure offerings will be 
    brought to my name, because my name will be great among the nations,&quot; says 
    the LORD Almighty.<br>
    Mal 1:12 &quot;But you profane it by saying of the Lord's table, 'It is defiled,' 
    and of its food, 'It is contemptible.'<br>
    Mal 1:13 And you say, 'What a burden!' and you sniff at it contemptuously,&quot; 
    says the LORD Almighty. &quot;When you bring injured, crippled or diseased 
    animals and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hands?&quot; 
    says the LORD.<br>
    Mal 1:14 &quot;Cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and 
    vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I 
    am a great king,&quot; says the LORD Almighty, &quot;and my name is to be feared among 
    the nations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the Temple ceremonies of Israel, animals were offered as a blood 
  sacrifice and burnt offering. God had specified that the animals to be offered 
  should be blemish free, in perfect health:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 12:5 (KJV) Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first 
    year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To insure the perfection of the animal, it was rigorously inspected by a 
  priest to confirm its suitability. The reason for this was that these 
  sacrifices were intended to be representative of the perfection of Jesus 
  Christ:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 1:19 (KJV) But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb 
    without blemish and without spot:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However, as Malachi states above, Israel had begun to offer defective 
  animals for sacrifice, keeping the best of the flock for themselves, in 
  defiance of the specific requirements of God. Both the priests and the laity 
  were responsible, since defective animals were knowingly offered by the laity, 
  and the priesthood was knowingly permitting these unsuitable animals to be 
  used for sacrifice. They were openly cheating God of the pure sacrifice he 
  required.</p>
  <p>Catholics will sometimes suggest that verse 11 above is a prophetic 
  reference to a future &quot;sacrifice&quot; that can only be fulfilled by the sacrifice 
  of the Eucharist of the Catholic Mass. This is evident in the Catholic Douay 
  Rheims Bible, as revised by Bishop Challoner and published in 1899. Verse 11 
  in the 1st chapter of Malachi reads as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 1:11 For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name 
    is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and 
    there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the 
    Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The footnote for this verse in the Catholic Douay Rheims Bible reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ver. 11. <em>A clean oblation.</em> Viz., the precious body and blood of 
    Christ in the eucharistic sacrifice.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Douay Catechism of 1649 also claims Malachi 1:11 is prophetic of the 
  Catholic Mass:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is the blessed Eucharist a sacrifice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a <i>clean oblation, </i>which the prophet Malachy i. 
    11, foretold would be offered from the rising to the going down of the sun, 
    in every place among the Gentiles; which was prefigured by Melchisedech, 
    priest of the Most High (Gen. xiv. 18,) when he brought forth bread and 
    wine; and which was, in reality, instituted at the last supper by Jesus 
    Christ, when he took bread and wine, blessed them, and distributed them with 
    his own hands amongst the apostles, saying, THIS IS MY BODY; THIS IS MY 
    BLOOD. Christ Jesus is a priest for ever, according to the order of <i>
    Melchisedech </i>(<i>Heb. </i>v. 8,) and so he instituted, according to his 
    order; that is to say, in bread and wine, this great sacrifice of the NEW 
    LAW.</p>

  <p>Now in Strong's Hebrew Dictionary the word translated &quot;incense&quot; in the NIV

  <blockquote>
    <p>H6999. qatar, kaw-tar'; a prim. root [rather ident. with H7000 through 
    the idea of fumigation in a close place and perh. thus driving out the

    bloodless and voluntary): -- gift, oblation, (meat) offering, present, 
    sacrifice.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="40%" align="center">
  <p>The following is an analysis of Malachi 1:11 from a recent Roman Catholic 
  Bible commentary:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>incense is offered</em>: Verbal and nominal forms based on the root
    <em>qtr</em>, like <em>muqtar</em> [H6999] here, have to do with any kind of 
    offering which gives off smoke, but in postexilic texts precise enough to 
    let us see what is being offered they have to do with incense or other 
    aromatic substances. The ptc. <em>muggas</em> can be used of bringing any 
    type of offering before God.</p>
    <p><em>pure offering</em>: Hebr <em>tahor</em> [H2889] in a cultic context 
    means &quot;pure&quot; in the sense of being free from all that ritually defiles; the 
    contrast with the blemished animals sacrificed by the priests of Jerusalem 
    is thus clear. The word <em>minha</em> [H4503] as a technical cultic term 
    designates a cereal offering (Lev 2); of itself, the word means a pleasant 
    &quot;gift&quot; (and is so translated in the NEB, perhaps unfortunately).</p>
    <p>It will be noted that none of these cultic terms has to do with animal 
    sacrifice, although the practice they describe is being compared with 
    contemporary Israelite practice of animal sacrifice. This verse has received 
    the most attention through the centuries. Many have taken it as referring 
    specifically to the future Christian eucharistic sacrifice, or to the 
    sacrifice on the cross, or to the quality of sacrifice less specifically in 
    the future messianic era. It is difficult to take the literal sense as 
    having reference to the future. It is made up of nominal clauses, without 
    any finite vb., and the ptc. <em>muggas</em>, &quot;offered&quot; cannot by itself 
    give these clauses future reference any more than do the ptcs. in v 12, 
    whose time reference is clearly present. ...</p>
    <p>Taken at face value, this verse contrasts the offensive sacrificial abuse 
    (involving animals) in Jerusalem with the pleasing oblatory practice (even 
    without sacrificial animals) everywhere else in the world. Pagans at least 
    show the right disposition; Judeans cheat Yahweh. To the objection that so 
    favorable a view of worship among all nations is not consonant with Mal's 
    particularism one may reply that the direct purpose of this view is not that 
    of praising pagan worship but rather that of shaming the priests of Judah by 
    contrasting the quality of offerings to divinity everywhere else. That pagan 
    offerings are everywhere ritually pure and that pagans everywhere give 
    worship to the name of Yahweh are, in context, less statements of fact than 
    they are rhetorical exaggerations meant to shame the Judeans. They move a 
    step further than the universal acknowledgment of Yahweh enunciated in v 14.</p>

  <hr width="40%" align="center">
  <p>So, a modern Catholic interpretation of Malachi 1:11 concludes that it is
  <em>not</em> prophetic, that it refers to contemporary non-animal pagan 
  offerings rather than a future &quot;Christian&quot; application, and that it was 
  intended to shame Israel by comparing their blemished and insincere offerings 
  to the universally sincere and honest offerings of the pagans. In short, 
  modern Catholic scholars have determined that, at &quot;face value&quot;, it does <em>
  not</em> refer to the &quot;sacrifice&quot; of the Catholic Eucharist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <p>My reply, sent to CAI on 17 Sept 2002:</p>
  <p>Look more closely, and you will see that what I presented was <u>not</u> my 
  conclusion, but that of the <i>New Jerome Biblical Commentary</i>, a Catholic 
  publication, which said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It is difficult to take the literal sense as having reference to the 
    future. It is made up of nominal clauses, without any finite vb., and the 
    ptc. <em>muggas</em>, &quot;offered&quot; cannot by itself give these clauses future 
    reference any more than do the ptcs. in v 12, <u>whose time reference is 
    clearly present</u>. ...&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In other words, they are saying the Hebrew text does <u>not</u> support the 
  contention that it refers to a future (New Covenant) application. Note again 
  how the 1899 Roman Catholic <i>Douay Rheims</i> Bible is worded:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 1:11 (DR) For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, my 
    name is great among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrifice, and 
    there is offered to my name a clean oblation: for my name is great among the 
    Gentiles, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And also the 1970 Roman Catholic <i>New American Bible</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 1:11 (NAB) For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, my 
    name is great among the nations, And everywhere they bring sacrifice to my 
    name, and a pure offering, For great is my name among the nations, says the 
    LORD of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The ecumenical <i>New Revised Standard Version</i> Bible of 1989, endorsed 
  by both Catholics and Protestants agrees:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 1:11 (NRSV) For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name is 
    great among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, 
    and a pure offering; for my name is great among the nations, says the LORD 
    of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A modern Jewish <i>Hebrew-English Tanakh,</i> published in 1999 by the 
  Jewish Publication Society, renders the verse as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 1:11 (JPS TANAKH) For from where the sun rises to where it sets, My 
    name is honored among the nations, and everywhere incense and pure oblation 
    are offered to My name; for My name is honored among the nations--said the 
    LORD of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Demonstrably a future event&quot;, no, as I have just quoted the two most 
  widely published Roman Catholic Bibles in English, plus an ecumenical 
  Catholic/Protestant Bible translation, <i>and</i> a Jewish Old Testament, and 
  they all use the present tense for that verse, because according to Catholic 
  scholars, the Hebrew text simply does <u>not</u> indicate a future/prophetic 
  application.</p>
  <p>You asked &quot;... are you suggesting that God was going to be pleased by a 
  &quot;pure&quot; offering made by <em>pagans</em>, that is, <em>non-Christians</em>?&quot;&nbsp; 
  And &quot;what Gentile/pagan/Christian offering could be said to be 'pure?'&quot; Again, 
  I was presenting the conclusions of the <i>New Jerome Biblical Commentary,</i> 
  and they said the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>&quot;pure offering</em>: Hebr <em>tahor</em> [H2889] in a cultic context 
    means &quot;pure&quot; in the sense of being free from all that ritually defiles; the 
    contrast with the blemished animals sacrificed by the priests of Jerusalem 
    is thus clear.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Taken at face value, this verse contrasts the offensive sacrificial 
    abuse (involving animals) in Jerusalem with the pleasing oblatory practice 
    (even without sacrificial animals) everywhere else in the world. Pagans at 
    least show the right disposition; Judeans cheat Yahweh.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;That pagan offerings are everywhere ritually pure and that pagans 
    everywhere give worship to the name of Yahweh are, in context, less 
    statements of fact than they are rhetorical exaggerations meant to shame the 
    Judeans.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the Catholic <u><i>New Jerome Biblical Commentary</i></u> is saying the 
  clear intent of Mal 1:11 is to contrast the dishonest, impure/defective 
  offerings of the Jews with the honest, ritually pure/perfect offering of 
  contemporary pagans, so to their shame, the Jews were cheating God, but pagans 
  were not. Therefore, recent Catholic scholarship concludes that the Catholic 
  Mass is <i>not</i> prophetically indicated in Mal 1:11, because a future tense 
  is simply <u>not</u> supported by the Hebrew text, rather it is clearly an 
  unwarranted imposition.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><a name="withdraw">CAI withdraws from the 
  discussion.</a></font></b></p>
  <p>For four weeks CAI refused to post my 17 Sept reply to the &quot;Sacrifice 
  Challenge&quot; on their site. Through an email exchange with Robert Sungenis of 
  CAI, the excuse that I have been given is that Jacob Michael has been given 
  other duties and that the Canuck's Challenge section of the CAI web site is 
  being removed &quot;because of the time expenditures involved&quot;. (Of the four 
  Canuck's Challenges listed at CAI, the Sacrifice Challenge appeared to be the
  <i>only one</i> with any response, the one given above.)</p>
  <p>Now I do not demand, nor do I expect, instant replies from CAI, and can 
  readily understand that other things may be more pressing, but I <u>do</u> 
  expect them to post submitted replies in a more-or-less timely manner after 
  they are received, and I do expect them, in good faith, to continue to 
  maintain the discussion on their site <font face="Times New Roman">—</font> 
  after all, it was <u>their</u> challenge I am answering.</p>
  <p>In my opinion, the removal of a discussion-in-progress would be 
  unprofessional conduct unworthy of anyone who calls themselves an apologist. I 
  can only conclude that CAI is simply unable to answer the points I have raised 
  above, and therefore they find it necessary to extricate themselves from a 
  discussion they no longer want to pursue. In my estimation, by their 
  withdrawal, CAI will in effect concede the debate in my favor, and I think 
  most any unbiased observer would agree.</p>
  <p><u><b>Update</b></u></p>
  <p>It turns out the Canadians formerly with CAI, broke away because they no 
  longer wished to be associated with the recently aberrant, bizarre, and even 
  heretical views of Robert Sungenis, founder of CAI, and this is actually why 
  the Canuck's Challenge section was removed from the CAI site. Since their 
  defection from CAI, the Canadians have established their own web site at <b>
  <a href="http://www.catholic-legate.com/">Catholic Legate</a></b>, including 
  the <b><a href="http://www.catholic-legate.com/challenge/challenge.html">
  Canuck's Challenge</a></b> page, though they have NOT reposted the Sacrifice 
  Challenge, so it would seem that neither CAI or The Catholic Legate wish to 
  pursue the discussion any further.</p>
