  <p>Only the Bible...</p>
  <p>Some people will say, &quot;If it is not in the Bible, I will not believe it.&quot; Ask
  them if they believe in the Holy Trinity. If they say 'yes, of course', then say,
  &quot;O.K. then find the word 'Trinity' for me in the Bible.&quot; They can't find it
  because that word is not in the Bible. How then can anyone who believes in the Holy
  Trinity say, 'SOLA SCRIPTURA' (only the Bible)?</p>
  <p>Do you sincerely believe the Bible is the Holy Word of GOD, and is the truth?<br>
  Do you feel if it is in the Bible, you can believe it?<br>
  Do you feel if it is not in the Bible, you will not believe it?</p>
  <p>But what about 'Tradition'?</p>
  <p>Some people will say 'Tradition' is just something the Catholic Church uses and we
  can't really believe it because if it isn't written, it can't be true. 'SOLA SCRIPTURA'...</p>
  <p>Lets look at this more closely...</p>
  <p>Now some are saying, they believe in the 'Trinity', of which, the word is not in the
  Bible (neither is the word 'Incarnation' but most Christians believe in it), but they
  don't believe in 'Tradition' which IS in the Bible. What? 'Tradition' is in the Bible...?</p>
  <p>Well for starters, look in your Bible in Thessalonians:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2Thes 2:15, 'Therefore brethren, stand fast, and hold the TRADITIONS which ye have been
    taught, whether by WORD, or our Epistle'. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This verse is telling you to honor the traditions which have been handed down by word
  of mouth from generation to generation. SOLA SCRIPTURA...? No way, &quot;For the Bible
  tells me so.&quot;</p>
  <p>An 'apparent' Bible conflict with 2Thes 2:15, is Col 2:8, </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the
    'tradition' of MEN, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However the Bible refers to two types of 'Tradition', human 'tradition' (small 't')
  handed down by men and not after Christ (as stated in Col 2:8), and apostolic 'Tradition'
  (capital 'T'), handed down from the 'Word of GOD', the teachings of Jesus Christ Himself,
  and the on going teaching of the Church. The condemnations of tradition in Mt 15:3, Mk
  7:9, and Col 2:8 refer to bad human traditions. 2Thes 2:15 refers to apostolic tradition,
  the 'Word of GOD'. See references at the end of this file.</p>
  <p>It is generally accepted that Moses wrote the first few books of the Old Testament. His
  time was many hundreds of years later than the time of Adam and Eve, and others in these
  first books. He had no 'Bible' with which to refer while writing Genesis, but he was
  inspired by GOD, and he did have 'Tradition', handed down to him from generation to
  generation.</p>
  <p>Jesus Christ taught orally, the 'spoken word'. He did not write a book. The only record
  that He wrote anything at all is in Jn 8:6-8, &quot;Jesus stooped down and with His finger
  wrote on the ground.&quot; We do not even know what He wrote. The first book of the New
  Testament was written many years after His death. Where did the New Testament writers get
  their source, Sola Scriptura? There was no Scriptura to draw from at that time, so
  'Tradition' had to have played a big role in the writing of these books. If you had no
  Tradition, you would have no Bible. There were many books written before and after the New
  Testament. The Bible does not say that it is the only book to be believed. Many say Peter
  was not the first Pope, because the Bible does not say he was ever in Rome. It does not
  say he wasn't there either. Many other writings of the same era (Eusebius Pamphilius, for
  example), say he was indeed in Rome, and he died there. This was shown to be true as his
  tomb was found under St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.</p>
  <p>In Matthew 1:1-17, we have the 'begats', the genealogy of Jesus Christ (v1,17). It is
  interesting to note that the genealogy is for Jesus's foster father, St. Joseph, who was
  not His real Father and not a blood relation. The genealogy of Mary, His real mother, a
  blood relation, who gave Him birth is not stated. After all, the substance of the blood
  that flowed through the veins of Jesus came from Mary. How do you account for this
  'apparent omission' in the Word of GOD? The answer is, it was 'TRADITIONAL' for the Jews
  to show the genealogy of the males and not the females. This clearly shows that
  'Tradition' played a big role in the written Word of the Holy Bible.</p>
  <p>* Note! The Bible does show Mary to be of the house of David, but no ancestral line can
  be traced. If you will compare:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:15, &quot;I will put enmity between thy seed and her 'SEED' (Jesus)...&quot;</p>
    <p>Rom 1:3, &quot;Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the 'SEED'
    of David according to the flesh.&quot;</p>
    <p>Lk 1:32, &quot;...and the Lord GOD will give Him the throne of David His father, and He
    shall be King over the house of Jacob forever.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Also see, Isa 7:13-14, Jn 7:42, Acts 2:29-30, 13:22-23, 2Tim 2:8, Rev 5:5.</p>
  <p>Some other words, with a similar meaning to the word, 'Tradition', are used throughout
  the Bible. Some examples are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mt 28:20, &quot;TEACHING them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER I HAVE COMMANDED
    YOU.&quot;</p>
    <p>Jn 15:27, &quot;And you also shall BEAR WITNESS, because you have been with Me from the
    beginning.&quot;</p>
    <p>1Cor 11:2, 'Now I praise you brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the
    ORDINANCES (the Greek text says, 'keep the TRADITIONS'), as I delivered them to you'.</p>
    <p>1Cor 15:2, 'By which ye are saved, if ye keep in MEMORY what I preached to you, unless
    ye have believed in vain'.</p>
    <p>Isa 59:21, '...My words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy
    mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
    the Lord, from henceforth and forever'. Isaiah said it all...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>See also, 2Tim 1:13, 2Tim 2:2, 2Tim 3:14, 1Pet 1:25, 1Jn 2:24, 2Jn 1:12</p>
  <p>Another verse using the word, 'tradition' (human tradition) is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:14, 'And profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation,
    being more exceedingly zealous of the TRADITIONS of my fathers'.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It has been said, that all that is written in the Gospels cumulatively, would only
  cover 18 days in the life of Jesus Christ. He lived for 33 years or 33 X 365 = 12045 days.
  What about the missing 12027 days? Where are the 'writings' of over 99% of His life? A
  good part is probably lost, and the remainder is, no doubt...TRADITION!</p>
  <p>How can anyone dismiss what John says in: John 20:30 and 21:25</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jn 21:25, 'And there are also MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH JESUS DID, the which, if they
    should be written every one, I suppose that even the WORLD ITSELF COULD NOT CONTAIN THE
    BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE WRITTEN. AMEN'. Amen is right...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So what does all this mean...? In a few words, 'KEEP THE TRADITIONS'.</p>
  <p>The 'triangle'...</p>
  <p>Have you ever looked at an equilateral triangle (equal lengths and angles in all
  dimensions)? It is the strongest, most rigid geometric form in existence. You see a lot of
  them in use in bridges to add strength. The Catholic Church is very careful to preserve
  'Tradition'. It is one leg of a triangle of Church teaching. The other two legs are Holy
  Scripture and the Magisterium. No one leg can subsist without the other two. We have a
  triangle in the Holy Trinity, a triangle in the teaching of the Church, and a triangle in
  each living person, a body, soul, and spirit. The legs of each of these 3 triangles cannot
  be separated and still retain the attributes, integrity, and the meaning of the whole.</p>
  <p>The best one liner, for the defense of 'Tradition', I have heard is, &quot;SOLA
  SCRIPTURA, show me in the Bible where it says, SOLA SCRIPTURA, only the Bible.&quot;</p>
  <p>St. Augustine, Martin Luther's guide and mentor, ought to have the last word about Sola
  Scriptura. He said, &quot;But for the authority of the Church, I would not believe the
  Gospel.&quot; </p>
  <p>Bible References for Sola Scriptura:</p>
  <p>Gen 3:15, Isa 7:13-14, Mt 1:1-17, Lk 1:32, Jn 7:42, Acts 2:29-30, Acts 13:22-23, Rom

  comments in rebuttal. My comments will appear in this font size for easy distinction. Bear
  in mind as you read it that by definition Roman Catholic doctrines called Tradition cannot
  be found in the Bible and are claimed to need no biblical proof what-so-ever to validate
  them. The Church claims the right to declare such doctrines as being on a par with
  scripture, and binding on all Catholics, based on her assumed authority, handed down
  through what they call apostolic succession and residing in the office of the papacy and
  what is called the Magisterium. You cannot accept Roman Catholic Tradition without
  accepting the authority of the Pope. They are inextricably bound together. </font></h5>

  them if they believe in the Holy Trinity. If they say 'yes, of course', then say,
  &quot;O.K. then find the word 'Trinity' for me in the Bible.&quot; They can't find it

  Trinity say, 'SOLA SCRIPTURA' (only the Bible)?</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Simple-</font></h5>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and,
    lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove,
    and lighting upon him:<br>
    Mat 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
    pleased.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">There are three entities of deity here.</font></h5>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">First, Jesus the Son of God, who is being baptized.<br>
  Second, God the Holy Spirit who descends like a dove. <br>
  Third, God the Father who speaks from heaven claiming Jesus as His Son. </font></h5>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">That looks like a trinity to me. The point is that the
  concept of the Trinity IS found in scripture. The fact that the word trinity does not is
  irrelevant. The same is true with the concept of Sola Scriptura. The words need not be in
  the Bible for the concept to be found there.</font></h5>

  <p>Do you sincerely believe the Bible is the Holy Word of GOD, and is the truth?</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Yes, of course.</font></h5>
  <p>Do you feel if it is in the Bible, you can believe it?</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">It, meaning doctrines... Absolutely!</font></h5>
  <p>Do you feel if it is not in the Bible, you will not believe it?</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Precisely, I can safely reject any doctrine not taught by
  the Bible.</font></h5>
  <p>But what about 'Tradition'?<br>
  Some people will say 'Tradition' is just something the Catholic Church uses and we can't
  really believe it because if it isn't written, it can't be true. 'SOLA SCRIPTURA'...</p>
  <p>Lets look at this more closely...</p>
  <p>Now some are saying, they believe in the 'Trinity', of which, the word is not in the
  Bible (neither is the word 'Incarnation' but most Christians believe in it), ....</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">The concept of the trinity is found in the Bible, even if
  the word is not. (see above). The same is true of the incarnation and Sola Scriptura.</font></h5>
  <p>... but they don't believe in 'Tradition' which IS in the Bible. What? 'Tradition' is
  in the Bible...?</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Careful now. Notice the capital T in Tradition there. The
  claim is being made here that Roman Catholic Tradition is to be found in the Bible. Here
  is a link to my article on every single occurance of the word <nobr><img SRC="star.gif"
  width="16" height="12"> <a HREF="trdition.html">TRADITION</a></nobr> in the New Testament
  ... It will begin by explaining just what Tradition (T) is to a Catholic, in their own
  words, which is essential to understand in this discussion.</font></h5>
  <p>Well for starters, look in your Bible in Thessalonians:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2Thes 2:15, 'Therefore brethren, stand fast, and hold the TRADITIONS which ye have been
    taught, whether by WORD, or our Epistle'. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This verse is telling you to honor the traditions which have been handed down by word
  of mouth from generation to generation. SOLA SCRIPTURA...? No way, &quot;For the Bible
  tells me so.&quot;</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">There is a subtle blurring of the difference between
  Tradition with capitol &quot;T&quot; and tradition with a lower case &quot;t&quot;. Every
  sermon ever given, no matter how godly, is tradition (t). The Bible itself is tradition
  (t). Anything passed on from one person to another is tradition (t). But is Paul
  advocating Tradition (T) (unbiblical doctrines)? No, he is warning those in Thessolonica
  to beware of anyone who tries to teach them a Gospel message other than the one he
  preached. Specifically he is talking about how soon the second coming would be, that it
  was not imminent as they thought (vs. 2-3). Paul is not making a case for unbiblical
  doctrines, he is warning against those who would teach (by any means) doctrines
  contradictory to his own teaching. That principle applies today. If Paul did not teach a
  doctrine, then he strongly warns against it as false. (See Galations 1:6-8) The Catholics
  are doing precisely what Paul condemns. </font></h5>
  <p>An 'apparent' Bible conflict with 2Thes 2:15, is Col 2:8, </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the
    'tradition' of MEN, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>However the Bible refers to two types of 'Tradition', human 'tradition' (small 't')
  handed down by men and not after Christ (as stated in Col 2:8), and apostolic 'Tradition'
  (capital 'T'), handed down from the 'Word of GOD', the teachings of Jesus Christ Himself,
  and the on going teaching of the Church. </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">This is not an accurate or complete definition of terms. A
  further clarification-</font></h5>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Jesus and the apostles all taught the word of God orally.
  This is tradition (t) in the generic sense. Simultaneous with, and subsequent to this oral
  teaching, the New Testament was written, transfering the oral teachings to the written
  word. This is also tradition (t) and also the word of God. Tradition (T) is not to be
  found in scripture by Catholic definition, yet is made equal to scripture in authority.
  Tradition (T) is said to be the word of God also, and equally binding on the Catholic. The
  Catholic claims that there are doctrines essential to salvation [Tradition (T) ] that are
  not to be found in the Bible, but that are revealed ONLY from the Papacy or Magisterium. </font></h5>
  <p>The condemnations of tradition in Mt 15:3, Mk 7:9, and Col 2:8 refer to bad human
  traditions. 2Thes 2:15 refers to apostolic tradition, the 'Word of GOD'. See references at
  the end of this file.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">For this argument to be valid, one would have to prove
  that essential doctrines (articles of faith) as taught by Paul were the subject of 2 Thess
  2:15, but were <em>never recorded in the Bible</em>. How do you prove that? </font></h5>
  <p>It is generally accepted that Moses wrote the first few books of the Old Testament. His
  time was many hundreds of years later than the time of Adam and Eve, and others in these
  first books. He had no 'Bible' with which to refer while writing Genesis, but he was
  inspired by GOD, and he did have 'Tradition', handed down to him from generation to
  generation.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Moses throughout his adult life spoke directly with God
  face to face. His books are the result of those conversations with God. Moses had no need
  for oral traditions or fables from men. Interestingly enough, Paul states this was the
  case with himself quite clearly in the first chapter of Galatians. Looks like a trend to
  me. </font></h5>
  <p>Jesus Christ taught orally, the 'spoken word'. He did not write a book. The only record
  that He wrote anything at all is in Jn 8:6-8, &quot;Jesus stooped down and with His finger
  wrote on the ground.&quot; We do not even know what He wrote. </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">This is irrelevant. What doctrines essential to salvation
  were taught by Jesus and never recorded in Scripture? What proof can be offered? None in
  both cases. </font></h5>
  <p>The first book of the New Testament was written many years after His death. Where did
  the New Testament writers get their source, Sola Scriptura? </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">In many cases they were eye witnesses to what they wrote,
  or had spoken with eyewitnesses, but their primary source was the Holy Spirit- 2 Tim 3:16
  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, ... </font></h5>
  <p>There was no Scriptura to draw from at that time, ... </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">No scripture to draw from??? What did the Bereans have to
  consult? (Acts 17:10-11) What about the Old Testament? It was THE authority they used to
  check up on whether or not Paul was preaching the truth! Imagine that. They did not trust
  Paul until what he taught was checked and in complete harmony with the Old Testament! And
  Paul was IMPRESSED by the Bereans because they did this! This is Sola Scriptura in action!
  </font></h5>
  <p>... so 'Tradition' had to have played a big role in the writing of these books. If you
  had no Tradition, you would have no Bible. </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">It would seem that Bob confuses Tradition (T) and
  tradition again. The Holy Spirit inspired all scripture. That is the process of tradition
  (t) not Tradition (T). Preaching also passes on the word of God. That is tradition (t) not
  Tradition (T). A doctrine proclaimed without a scintilla of Biblical foundation or proof
  is Tradition (T). How Tradition (T) can play any part in the production of the Bible is
  beyond me. The two are in direct opposition to each other. </font></h5>
  <p>There were many books written before and after the New Testament. The Bible does not
  say that it is the only book to be believed. </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">The issue better stated is whether or not the Bible should
  be the only source for doctrinal beliefs, otherwise known as articles of faith, and
  whether or not the Bible makes this principle clear. I maintain that it does teach the
  principle. </font></h5>
  <p>Many say Peter was not the first Pope, because the Bible does not say he was ever in
  Rome. It does not say he wasn't there either. Many other writings of the same era
  (Eusebius Pamphilius, for example), say he was indeed in Rome, and he died there. This was
  shown to be true as his tomb was found under St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Whether or not Peter was ever in Rome is not important.
  Just who's remains are in the crypt in St. Peter's has never been proved to my knowledge.
  It may be nothing more than rumor, or it may be Peter. Either way, this does not affect
  the doctrinal issues or articles of faith as they relate to Sola Scriptura. </font></h5>
  <p>In Matthew 1:1-17, we have the 'begats', the genealogy of Jesus Christ (v1,17). It is
  interesting to note that the genealogy is for Jesus's foster father, St. Joseph, who was
  not His real Father and not a blood relation. The genealogy of Mary, His real mother, a
  blood relation, who gave Him birth is not stated. After all, the substance of the blood
  that flowed through the veins of Jesus came from Mary. How do you account for this
  'apparent omission' in the Word of GOD? The answer is, it was 'TRADITIONAL' for the Jews
  to show the genealogy of the males and not the females. This clearly shows that
  'Tradition' played a big role in the written Word of the Holy Bible.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Things that ARE recorded in the Bible are NOT Tradition
  (T) by definition! The geneology of Jesus is recorded to fulfill prophecy and it does
  that. Jews of that era could probably check the ancestry of Jesus (and probably did) to
  validate the prophecy that the messiah would be descended from David. That Joseph's
  lineage was provided rather than Mary's, because of Jewish tradition (t), does not
  validate unbiblical Tradition (T). The lack of Mary's detailed lineage shows that it would
  not have been proof of anything. </font></h5>
  <p>* Note! The Bible does show Mary to be of the house of David, but no ancestral line can
  be traced. If you will compare:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:15, &quot;I will put enmity between thy seed and her 'SEED' (Jesus)...&quot;</p>
    <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Gen 3:15 is spoken to Satan and is about Eve's seed
    (descendant) which eventually was indeed Jesus. Mary though, is not in the verse. Here is
    my article on the <nobr><img SRC="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> </font><font
    face="Arial" size="3"><a HREF="douay.html">PROTO-EVANGELIUM</a> </nobr>that elaborates on

    <p>Rom 1:3, &quot;Concerning His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the 'SEED'
    of David according to the flesh.&quot;</p>
    <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Rom 1:3 - It was the blood line of Joseph that made Jesus
    a descendant of David according to prophecy, not Mary. Mary's lineage is not recorded.
    Only Joseph's geneology is offered by Matthew in his first chapter, because it was the
    only proof needed to show all the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah coming from
    the seed of Abraham and David were fulfilled. </font></h5>
    <p>Lk 1:32, &quot;...and the Lord GOD will give Him the throne of David His father, and He
    shall be King over the house of Jacob forever.&quot; </p>
    <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Lk 1:32- Again David is the Father of Jesus through
    Joseph, not Mary. </font></h5>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Also see, Isa 7:13-14, Jn 7:42, Acts 2:29-30, 13:22-23, 2Tim 2:8, Rev 5:5.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">The first chapter of Matthew proves these verses were
  fulfilled entirely in the blood line of Joseph. </font></h5>
  <p>Some other words, with a similar meaning to the word, 'Tradition', are used throughout
  the Bible. Some examples are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mt 28:20, &quot;TEACHING them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER I HAVE COMMANDED
    YOU.&quot;</p>
    <p>Jn 15:27, &quot;And you also shall BEAR WITNESS, because you have been with Me from the

    <p>1Cor 11:2, 'Now I praise you brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the

    <p>1Cor 15:2, 'By which ye are saved, if ye keep in MEMORY what I preached to you, unless
    ye have believed in vain'.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">All these verses refer to tradition (t), but not Tradition
  (T). Again, every spoken sermon ever given is oral tradition (t). It is quite a stretch to
  try and fill such sermons with unbiblical Catholic doctrines to qualify them as Tradition
  (T). One must keep mindful of the difference between them. Not all tradition is the same.</font></h5>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 59:21, '...My words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy
    mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
    the Lord, from henceforth and forever'. Isaiah said it all...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Ah, now here is an interesting case. This verse is not
  what it appears.<br>
  I have an article devoted to <img SRC="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  HREF="covnant.html">The Covenant of Isa 59:21 explained.</a> Quoting this verse out of
  context can be most embarrasing to the advocate of Tradition.</font></h5>
  <p>See also, 2Tim 1:13, 2Tim 2:2, 2Tim 3:14, 1Pet 1:25, 1Jn 2:24, 2Jn 1:12</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">The above verses all prove that the Gospel message was
  spoken. Who denies that? It still is. There is however, not a shred of evidence to support
  the notion that some doctrines taught were never recorded, and cannot be found today
  somewhere in scripture. <em>That </em>is Tradition (T).</font></h5>
  <p>Another verse using the word, 'tradition' (human tradition) is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:14, 'And profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation,
    being more exceedingly zealous of the TRADITIONS of my fathers'.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Indeed, verses 11-13 show Paul claiming the Gospel he
  preached came from God and not man (tradition). When he followed the tradition of the Jews
  he persecuted God's church zealously. He did not confer with men for the Gospel (v. 16),
  not even apostles (v.17). Read in context, Paul is repudiating the traditions of his
  fathers. </font></h5>
  <p>It has been said, that all that is written in the Gospels cumulatively, would only
  cover 18 days in the life of Jesus Christ. He lived for 33 years or 33 X 365 = 12045 days.
  What about the missing 12027 days? Where are the 'writings' of over 99% of His life? A
  good part is probably lost, and the remainder is, no doubt...TRADITION!</p>
  <p>How can anyone dismiss what John says in: John 20:30 and 21:25</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jn 21:25, 'And there are also MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH JESUS DID, the which, if they
    should be written every one, I suppose that even the WORLD ITSELF COULD NOT CONTAIN THE
    BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE WRITTEN. AMEN'. Amen is right...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So what does all this mean...? In a few words, 'KEEP THE TRADITIONS'.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Looks real good at first doesn't it? But it is not what
  you think! John closes the door on any such attempt to promote unbiblical articles of
  faith like Catholic Tradition- <br>
  Please see <img SRC="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> </font><font face="Arial" size="3"><a
  HREF="complete.html">Proof the Bible is not Complete in Doctrine?</a></font></h5>
  <p>The 'triangle'...</p>
  <p>Have you ever looked at an equilateral triangle (equal lengths and angles in all
  dimensions)? It is the strongest, most rigid geometric form in existence. You see a lot of
  them in use in bridges to add strength. The Catholic Church is very careful to preserve
  'Tradition'. It is one leg of a triangle of Church teaching. The other two legs are Holy
  Scripture and the Magisterium. No one leg can subsist without the other two. We have a
  triangle in the Holy Trinity, a triangle in the teaching of the Church, and a triangle in
  each living person, a body, soul, and spirit. The legs of each of these 3 triangles cannot
  be separated and still retain the attributes, integrity, and the meaning of the whole.</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">I really fail to see how the previous paragraph is
  anything but a sales pitch. </font></h5>
  <p>The best one liner, for the defense of 'Tradition', I have heard is, &quot;SOLA
  SCRIPTURA, show me in the Bible where it says, SOLA SCRIPTURA, only the Bible.&quot;</p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">This shows how little substance there is in the Catholic
  argument. With tongue firmly in cheek let me adopt the same perspective for a moment-</font></h5>
  <blockquote>
    <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">May I point out that the words Trinity or Triune God do
    not appear anywhere in Scripture. Therefore, the Bible does not teach it!</font></h5>
    <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">No where in Scripture does Jesus say I, Jesus Christ am
    God. Clearly then, this is a concept not taught in the Bible!</font></h5>
    <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">The word rapture cannot be found in scripture, so there is
    no such event taught within the covers of the Bible!</font></h5>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">How does this kind of approach ever arrive at the truth? </font></h5>
  <p>St. Augustine, Martin Luther's guide and mentor, ought to have the last word about Sola
  Scriptura. He said, &quot;But for the authority of the Church, I would not believe the
  Gospel.&quot; </p>
  <h5><font face="Arial" size="3">Well St. Augustine is entitled to his opinion, but volumes
  of such statements filling entire libraries do not equal the authority of a single verse
  of scripture. </font></h5>
