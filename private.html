<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>2 Pet 1:20 Knowing this first, that <b>no </b>prophecy of the <b>scripture
  is of any private interpretation.</b></p>
  <p>When discussing the principle of Sola Scriptura with Roman Catholics, they
  will frequently quote the above verse at you as &quot;proof&quot; that you
  have no business privately interpreting scripture. That interpretation, they
  will say, is the exclusive (private?) domain of the Roman Catholic Church, and
  not the private individual (the laity). Looks good in a cursory reading
  doesn't it? But let's look at just a few more verses, and get a feel for the
  context of this verse-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Pet 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
    well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until
    the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:<br>
    2 Pet 1:20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any
    private interpretation.<br>
    2 Pet 1:21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
    holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<br>
    2 Pet 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
    shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
    heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves
    swift destruction.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Look at that very closely. No PROPHECY of the scripture is of any private
  interpretation. Does that say that the Bible is not to be privately read,
  interpreted, and understood by the laity? What is the passage really saying?</p>
  <p>Verse 19- the prophecy found in the Bible is true, that shines like a light
  in darkness.</p>
  <p>Verse 20- none of the prophecy, or interpretation of that prophecy,
  recorded in scriptures is devised by the prophet himself. While the prophet
  wrote it, he is not the author of either the prophecy or the interpretation
  thereof.</p>
  <p>Verse 21- The Holy Spirit is both author and interpreter of prophecies in
  the Bible, not the prophet.</p>
  <p>Chapter 2:1 - Warns against false prophets.</p>
  <p>How do you recognize a false prophet? Simple. What they predict fails to
  come to pass with unerring accuracy. A genuine prophet never fails, because
  the prophecy and it's interpretation come from God, not the prophet's private
  interpretation, and God does not make mistakes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there even a hint that the Church is to be the sole interpreter of
      the entirety of Scripture for the laity? No.</li>
    <li>Does this forbid the reader of the Bible from coming to his own
      understanding of what the text is trying to say, without the aid of the
      Church? No.</li>
    <li>Does it make a case for Tradition? No. It is not even mentioned.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In context, this passage is clearly talking about prophets and their own
  prophetic interpretations. As an example, the prophets Joseph and Daniel, when
  they interpreted the dreams of the Pharaoh and King, they were not giving
  their own private interpretations, they were giving God's interpretation. As a
  result they were 100 percent accurate. So when you read in the Bible where a
  prophet reveals a prophecy or gives an interpretation of a prophetic dream, or
  prophetic scripture, they were revealed to the prophet by God Himself, through
  the Holy Spirit, and can be trusted to be accurate.</p>
  <p>Note the following-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Pet 3:14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
    diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.<br>
    2 Pet 3:15 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even
    as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath
    written unto you;<br>
    2 Pet 3:16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in
    which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned
    and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own
    destruction.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That is a warning to the Christian that should be heeded. Beware of those
  who would twist the meaning of scripture on crucial doctrinal issues. The <em>only</em>
  way to know for sure when this is happening is to be well educated in the
  scriptures yourself-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Tim 2:15 Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
    needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br>
    2 Tim 2:16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
    more ungodliness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly there are many Catholics that have little or no understanding of <nobr>2
  Peter 1:20 </nobr>at all. Yet, it is quoted repeatedly to bolster the
  authority of the church. When read in context though, the claimed support
  instantly evaporates before your very eyes. People simply need to read and
  study more than that single verse to properly understand it. Single verse
  proof-texting might very easily lead one astray. You must ALWAYS consider
  context and other related scripture verses to get the true meaning.</p>
