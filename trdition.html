<hr>
<blockquote> <strong><u> </u></strong>
  <p><strong><u>Roman Catholic Tradition</u></strong></p>
  <p>First a definition of terms. What is meant by Tradition? Usually
spelled with a capitalized T, this means Roman Catholic Tradition. How
does the Roman Catholic Church define Tradition? Here is what they say
in the new Vatican Catechism of the Catholic Church - (numbers are
paragraph numbers)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>#81 "Sacred Scripture is the speech of God as it is put down in
writing under the breath of the Holy Spirit." And [Holy] Tradition
transmits in its entirety the Word of God which has been entrusted to
the apostles by Christ the Lord and the Holy Spirit. It transmits it to
the successors of the apostles so that, enlightened by the Spirit of
truth, they may faithfully preserve, expound, and spread it abroad by
their preaching.</p>
    <p>#82 As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and
interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, "does not derive her
certainty about all revealed truths from the Holy Scriptures alone.
Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honored with equal
sentiments of devotion and reverence."</p>
    <p>#83 The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and
hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what
they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians
did not yet have a written New Testament, and the New Testament itself
demonstrates the process of living Tradition.</p>

Liguori Publications, English translation copyright 1994 by the United
States Catholic Conference, Inc.--Libreria Editrice Vaticana, bearing

  <p>Also there is this similar statement from a 19th century Roman
Catholic Catechism:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>What is tradition?<br>
    </i>[pg. 87]<br>
    <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. </i>The doctrines which the Apostles taught by
word of mouth, and which have descended through every successive
generation even to our times.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Source: <i>A Doctrinal Catechism</i>, by the Rev. Stephen Keenan,
published in 1848 by E. Dunigan &amp; Brother, [James B. Kirker], in
New York, No. 371 Broadway, pgs. 86-87.</p>
  <p>Note that these catechisms are both claiming that the apostles are
the original source of Catholic Tradition. They assert, in effect, that
the Catholic Traditions of papal infallibility, the immaculate
conception of Mary, prayer to the saints, veneration of images, the
assumption of Mary, Mary the queen of heaven, Mary the mediatrix of all
grace, etc., were believed and taught by the apostles but were never
set down explicitly in writing in the Bible. Rather, these Traditions
were supposedly believed from apostolic times, and passed down
faithfully from one generation to the next by <i>hearsay</i>, by word
of mouth.</p>
  <p>The result of Catholic teaching is that the Bible is represented
as being incomplete, just the written portion of the word of God, and
that only by the addition of the teachings of hearsay, the alleged oral
or unwritten "living Tradition" will you have the complete fullness of
the inspired Word of God. By "living Tradition" they mean the teaching
authority of the church passed on through the apostles to their
successors, which Catholics call the Magisterium. Here is how the <i>Dictionary
of the Liturgy</i> defines Magisterium-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The teaching authority of the Church, which was originally
bestowed on the Apostles with St. Peter at their head and now resides
in the bishops with the Pope at their head. This Magisterium is twofold.</p>
    <p>(1) The <em>Solemn or Extraordinary Magisterium</em> is
exercised in the formal declarations of the Pope or of the Ecumenical
Councils of Bishops approved by the Pope.</p>
    <p>(2) The <em>Ordinary Magisterium </em>is exercised by the Pope
or bishops in their normal means of instructing the faithful - through
word, writing, and action.</p>
    <p>The <em>Extraordinary Magisterium</em> is always infallible
when exercised. The <em>Ordinary Magisterium</em> may also be
infallible when the Pope or bishops teach with moral unanimity.
However, "no doctrine is understood as infallibly defined unless it is
clearly established as such" (Canon 749). Infallible teachings are to
be accorded the assent of faith by Catholics. Noninfallible teachings
must be given a religious respect of intellect and will.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Source: <i>Dictionary of the Liturgy</i>, by Rev. Jovian P. Lang,
OFM, published by Catholic Book Publishing Co., N.Y., Copyright 1989,

IMPRIMATUR of the Catholic Church, page 379.</p>
  <p>In a nutshell, the Roman Catholic Church claims for itself the
right and authority to declare doctrines or articles of faith
infallibly (without any error). These points of doctrine are to be
believed without doubt or question, at the risk of one's salvation.
These infallibly declared doctrines need not be revealed by scripture,
since their validity rests solely on the presumed apostolic teaching
authority given to Peter and his successors, which have; it is claimed;
passed down this Tradition in unwritten form (living Tradition)
primarily from Peter to the present pope. However, this oral Tradition
is considered to be as binding upon the Catholics, and according to one
Catholic writer, it is more safe than the Bible:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like two sacred rivers flowing from Paradise,
the Bible and divine Tradition contain the Word of God, the precious
gems of revealed truths.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though these two divine streams are in themselves,
on account of their divine origin, of equal sacredness, and are both
full of revealed truths, still, of the two, T<font size="2">RADITION</font>
is to us more clear and safe.</p>

  <p><u><strong>Infallible Papal declarations of doctrine from
Tradition.</strong></u></p>
  <p>An interesting thing to note here is that even Catholics would
have a very difficult time reciting a complete list of all the
"infallibly declared" doctrines and documents that they are bound by.
Papal and Council declarations generally tend to be rather ambiguous in
this area, leaving the issue open to interpretation. Not even the
official Catholic publications are bold enough to attempt a definitive
list of infallible papal encyclicals in order to clarify matters. It
would seem that the muddier the waters on this issue, the better
Catholics like it. And this from the same Church that claimed the
authority to define and declare the Canon of Scripture at the Council
of Trent! Can they not produce an authoritative list of their own
infallible papal declarations??? It seems not. Perhaps they feel that
hornet's nest is best left undisturbed.</p>
  <p>In any case, there are two "infallible" Papal declarations that I
suppose every Catholic would put at the top of any such list of Roman
Catholic Tradition-</p>
  <p>1. Pius IX and The Apostolic Constitution Defining the Dogma of
the Immaculate Conception, Ineffabilis Deus, December 8, 1854.</p>
  <p>Here is <img src="star.gif" height="12"
 width="16"> <a
 href="http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9ineff.htm"> <strong>Ineffabilis
Deus</strong></a> online.</p>
  <p>2. Pius XII and Mary's assumption into heaven, declared in the
Apostolic Constitution Defining the Dogma of the Assumption,
Munificentissimus Deus, November 1, 1950</p>
  <p>Here is <img src="star.gif" height="12"

 href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P12MUNIF.HTM"><strong>
Munificentissimus Deus</strong></a> online at EWTN.</p>
  <p>Beyond these two, opinions on infallible declarations would
probably diverge to varying degrees, but these two Traditions are
generally agreed to be prime examples of infallible declarations from
the Papacy. The first declares that Mary was preserved from any sin
what-so-ever for the entirety of her life, from the point of her
conception, and the second declares that Mary was taken up into heaven
at the conclusion of her life on earth (they are not real sure she
died). Any Catholic who doubts or rejects these Traditions, is
considered to have fallen away from the true church, and the true
Christian faith, at the risk of his salvation, since they are clearly
rebelling against the presumed infallible teaching authority of the
Magisterium.</p>
  <p>So, now the Roman Catholic usage of the word Tradition should be
clear. So what does tradition mean in everyday use? In a generic sense,
tradition is any practice, teaching, doctrine, or custom handed down
from one to another, and this can be passed on by the spoken word OR
through the written word. This definition can be confirmed in any
dictionary. Every sermon ever spoken constitutes tradition. Every bible
class ever given constitutes tradition. Every Bible ever printed
constitutes tradition. Every thought, word or deed passed on from one
to another is tradition in this generic sense. </p>
  <p>What now follows, is every occurrence of the words tradition or
traditions to be found in the New Testament. Each passage will be
examined in context to determine how the word is being used, and
whether or not it supports the Roman Catholic doctrine of Tradition.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Tradition in the New Testament</u></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the <strong>tradition</strong>
of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.<br>
Mat 15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
the commandment of God by your <strong>tradition</strong>?<br>
Mat 15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.<br>
Mat 15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;<br>
Mat 15:6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your <strong>tradition</strong>.</p>
    <p>Mark 7:1 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain
of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.<br>
Mark 7:2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with
defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.<br>
Mark 7:3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their
hands oft, eat not, holding the <strong>tradition</strong> of the
elders.<br>
Mark 7:4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold,
as the washing of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables.<br>
Mark 7:5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
disciples according to the <strong>tradition</strong> of the elders,
but eat bread with unwashen hands?<br>
Mark 7:6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of
you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their
lips, but their heart is far from me.<br>
Mark 7:7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.<br>
Mark 7:8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the <strong>
tradition </strong>of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many
other such like things ye do.<br>
Mark 7:9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
God, that ye may keep your own <strong>tradition</strong>.<br>
Mark 7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
curseth father or mother, let him die the death:<br>
Mark 7:11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
by me; he shall be free.<br>
Mark 7:12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
mother;<br>
Mark 7:13 Making the word of God of none effect through your <strong>
tradition</strong>, which ye have delivered: and many such like things
do ye.<br>
Mark 7:14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:<br>
Mark 7:15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him
can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they
that defile the man.<br>
Mark 7:16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the above passages from Matthew and Mark, there are two
illustrations used-</p>
  <p>First the Pharisees accuse the followers of Jesus of not washing
their hands in ritual fashion in accordance with tradition, prior to
eating a meal. Jesus' response to this accusation is that the words and
teachings of men will defile a man, not how he eats his food, or
whether or not he first washes his hands.</p>
  <p>Second, Jesus uses the commandment of honoring your Father and
Mother for illustration purposes. Some Jews would apparently declare
their goods and property "Corban" or in other words, dedicated to the
Temple, placing them out of bounds for their parents. A Jew who made
such a declaration was able to use the goods his entire life, without
having to share any of it with his parents. By declaring their property
Corban, or holy, they used Tradition as an outward display of holiness
to nullify the intent of the commandment of God to honor your Father
and Mother. This practice is condemned by Jesus as a tradition of men
than puts God's commandment to no effect. The standard Jesus uses in
these passages is the written word of God contained in the fifth
commandment (fourth by Catholic reckoning). In opposition to God's Law
are the unscriptural Traditions of the Pharisees, which are clearly
condemned. Who fails to see the relationship of unbiblical Roman
Catholic Traditions here?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 1:17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of
persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
sojourning here in fear:<br>
1 Pet 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
received by <strong> tradition</strong> from your fathers;<br>
1 Pet 1:19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
blemish and without spot:<br>
1 Pet 1:20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
world, but was manifest in these last times for you,<br>
1 Pet 1:21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The redemption by gold and silver here has two apparent
applications. First, the practice of freeing a slave by paying off his
debt, and second, the repeated apostasy of Israel and their worshipping
of silver and gold idols. This passage clearly teaches that redemption
lies only in Jesus Christ, and not in the Traditions or practices of
church fathers. Again, who fails to see the relationship of unbiblical
Roman Catholic Traditions here?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Col 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
vain deceit, after the <strong>tradition</strong> of men, after the
rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again tradition is used in a negative sense related to useless
deceptive philosophy based on human reasoning and the Traditions or
teachings of men. The Greek word translated rudiments here can be
associated with pagan spiritism. So, this passage condemns the logic,
traditions, and paganism of the world that lead the Christian away from
the simple Gospel message of salvation in Jesus Christ. Who would use
this verse to support the unbiblical Roman Catholic Traditions that
promote Mary worship?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was
preached of me is not after man.<br>
Gal 1:12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but
by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br>
Gal 1:13 For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews'
religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and
wasted it:<br>
Gal 1:14 And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in
mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the <strong>traditions</strong>
of my fathers.<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul makes an interesting point here. The Gospel message that he
preached came from Jesus, not from man or his traditions. In
establishing his preaching as true, Paul distances himself from the
unbiblical Jewish Traditions he so enthusiastically pursued and
enforced prior to his conversion to Christianity. This is a complete
rejection of his former Traditions as being opposed to the Gospel
message of Jesus Christ. So, where do Roman Catholic Traditions of Mary
fit here?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Thess 2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the <strong>
traditions</strong> which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our
epistle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Could this be it? Can this verse finally be the one to bolster
Roman Catholic Tradition? Oh, how often this verse is quoted by
Catholics!&nbsp; <a href="tradition-legate.html">See this page</a>. </p>
  <p>2 Thess 2:15 in no way supports Roman Catholic Tradition, unless
it can be proved that those very same Traditions were revealed to Paul
by Jesus Christ, and that Paul taught those Traditions. By definition
though, this is impossible for Catholic Traditions.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 3:6 Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that
walketh disorderly, and not after the <strong>tradition</strong> which
he received of us.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a href="idleness.html">See this page for 2 Th 3:6</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.<br>
1 Cor 11:2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all
things, and keep the <strong>ordinances*</strong>, as I delivered them
to you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>*(In the King James, the word translated as "ordinances" is
translated elsewhere as tradition.) Paul is exhorting the Corinthians
to keep the pure doctrines as he taught them, and as received from
Jesus Himself (Gal. 1:12). Paul is warning the Corinthians not to
wander from the truth as they have heard it from him, just as he does
in Galatians-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that
called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, there is no verse that endorses Roman Catholic
Tradition as they define it. Rather, it can be seen that the Roman
Catholic teachings such as those regarding Mary that are defined as
Tradition, are roundly condemned by scripture as the Traditions and
Doctrines of Men, and are a perverted Gospel to be rejected by those
who know the truth.</p>
  <p>The traditions (teachings and doctrines) of Jesus Christ, as
taught by the apostles, were all faithfully recorded in scripture, and
lead one to Christ only for salvation-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of
Israel, that by the name of <strong>Jesus Christ of Nazareth</strong>,
whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this
man stand here before you whole.<br>
Acts 4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders,
which is become the head of the corner.<br>
Acts 4:12 <strong>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there
is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
saved.</strong></p>
