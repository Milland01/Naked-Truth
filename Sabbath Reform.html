Needed"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days of Nehemiah, when the children of Israel had
brought upon themselves humiliation and distress by their departure
from God in disregarding his law, they sometimes felt that God had
forgotten them. The Lord showed his rebellious people that they were
dependent upon him for prosperity and safety, yet his eye was upon
them. They were feeble, exposed to the ravages of their enemies; yet
they were the guardians of the worship of the true God, and were to
preserve a knowledge of his law until the Prince of peace should come.
Nehemiah was God's chosen instrument to effect a reformation among his
people, and to deliver them from the oppression of their enemies. The
circumstances were discouraging, but Nehemiah was a man of courage and
fidelity. He caused the people to be instructed in the law they had
broken. Precept by precept it was carefully explained, that all might
fully understand the will of God. </big></font></big></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principal ways in which the people had departed
from God was in the desecration of the Sabbath. Heathen merchants, who
came to Jerusalem to sell their wares, lodged outside the gates, and
when they were opened in the morning, offered their goods for sale.
Many of the Jews traded with them on the Sabbath; these not only broke
the Sabbath themselves, but tried to remove the scruples of their more
conscientious countrymen. Thus to a great extent the sacredness of the
Sabbath was destroyed. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jews acknowledged that their deplorable condition was
the result of their transgressions; and in a general assembly, the
Levites, as the representatives of the people, confessed God's goodness
in his dealings with them, and their ingratitude and sins as a nation,
and pleaded before God: "Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty,
and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us, on our kings,
on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our
fathers, and on all thy people; since the time of the kings of Assyria
unto this day. Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us;
for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly. Neither have our
kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor
hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou
didst testify against them. For they have not served thee in their
kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the
large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they
from their wicked works. Behold, we are servants this day, and for the
land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the
good thereof, behold, we are servants in it; and it yieldeth much
increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins;
also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their
pleasure, and we are in great distress." </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having suffered punishment for their sins, and acknowledged
the justice of God in his dealings with them, they covenanted to obey
his law. And that it might be a sure covenant, and preserved in a
permanent form, it was written out, and the priests, Levites, and
princes "sealed unto it." They had a clear knowledge of the claims of
God and of the character of sin; and with those who had real principle,
to see and understand was to act. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;We need Nehemiahs in 1884, who shall arouse the people to
see how far they are from God through their transgressions. It is time
for the whole Christian world to search the Scriptures for themselves;
for in the pulpits all through our land the law of God is made void by
precept and example. The papal power has thought to change the law of
God by instituting a Sabbath for the world and the Christian church;
and this spurious Sabbath is exalted and revered, while the Sabbath of
Jehovah is trampled beneath unholy feet. But will the Lord degrade his
law to meet the standard of men? Will he accept a man-made institution
in place of the Sabbath which he has sanctified and blessed? No; the
convenience or profit of men is not to supersede the claims of God; for
he is a jealous God. He does not alter his precepts to gratify the
desires of the ambitious or the covetous. "Thus saith the Lord" should
be sufficient to settle all controversy. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;He who instituted the Sabbath has never changed it to a
common day. He rested on a definite day, and blessed and sanctified a
definite day, and he requires the human family to observe that definite
day. Every part of God's plan will be perfectly executed. Satan has
interfered, and attempted to thwart it; but there is no change in the
law of God. The position that God blessed and sanctified a seventh part
of time, and no day in particular, is one of Satan's devices. By this
means he has so confused the minds of many that they regard God's holy
restday as possessing no special sacredness; and because the world do
so, they feel at liberty to set it aside, and select a Sabbath that
suits their own convenience. And professed ministers of the gospel
assure their congregations that this course is right. Those who are
conscientiously observing the original Sabbath are styled heretics,
deluded fanatics. But who are thus regarded in God's sight? Whom will
he rebuke and punish</big></font></big><font color="#000000"

 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>&#8213;</i></font></big></font><big><font
 color="#000000" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>those
who have kept the day that he blessed and
sanctified; or those who, trampling upon the holy commandment, have
accepted the institution of the papacy? </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is need of a Sabbath reform among us, who profess to
observe God's holy restday. Some discuss their business matters and lay
plans on the Sabbath, and God looks upon this in the same light as
though they engaged in the actual transaction of business. Others who
are well acquainted with the Bible evidences that the seventh day is
the Sabbath, enter into partnership with men who have no respect for
God's holy day. A Sabbathkeeper cannot allow men in his employ, paid by
his money, to work on the Sabbath. If, for the sake of gain, he allows
the business in which he has an interest to be carried on on the
Sabbath by his unbelieving partner, he is equally guilty with the
unbeliever; and it is his duty to dissolve the relation, however much
he may lose by so doing. Men may think they cannot afford to obey God,
but they cannot afford to disobey him. Those who are careless in their
observance of the Sabbath will suffer great loss. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord has a controversy with his professed people in
these last days. In this controversy men in responsible positions will
take a course directly opposite to that pursued by Nehemiah. They will
not only ignore and despise the Sabbath themselves, but they will try
to keep it from others by burying it beneath the rubbish of custom and
tradition. In churches and in large gatherings in the open air,
ministers will urge upon the people the necessity of keeping the first
day of the week. There are calamities on sea and land: and these
calamities will increase, one disaster following close upon another;
and the little band of conscientious Sabbathkeepers will be pointed out
as the ones who are bringing the wrath of God upon the world by their
disregard of Sunday. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan urges this falsehood that he may take the world
captive. It is his plan to compel men to accept errors. He takes an
active part in the promulgation of all false religions, and will stop
at nothing in his efforts to enforce erroneous doctrines. Under a cloak
of religious zeal, men, influenced by his spirit, have invented the
most cruel tortures for their fellowmen, and have inflicted the most
awful sufferings upon them. Satan and his agents have the same spirit
still; and the history of the past will be repeated in our day. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are men who have set their minds and will to
accomplish evil; in the dark recesses of their hearts they have
resolved what crimes they will commit. These men are self-deceived.
They have rejected God's great rule of right, and in its stead have
erected a standard of their own, and comparing themselves with this
standard they pronounce themselves holy. The Lord will permit them to
reveal what is in their hearts, to act out the spirit of the master
that controls them. He will let them show their hatred of his law in
their treatment of those who are loyal to its requirements. They will
be actuated by the same spirit of religious frenzy that goaded on the
mob that crucified Christ; church and State will be united in the same
corrupt harmony. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;The church of today has followed in the steps of the Jews
of old, who set aside the commandments of God for their own traditions.
She has changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant, and
now, as then, pride, unbelief, and infidelity are the result. Her true
condition is set forth in these words from the song of Moses: "They
have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children;
they are a perverse and crooked generation. Do ye thus requite the
Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath
bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?" </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Nehemiah moved out as a reformer and deliverer in
Israel, he was actuated by love to God and anxiety for the prosperity
of his people. His heart was in the work he had undertaken; his hope,
his energy his enthusiasm, his determination of character, were
contagious, and inspired others with the same courage and lofty
purpose. Each man became a Nehemiah in his own sphere, and helped to
make stronger the hand and heart of his neighbor; and soon feebleness
was succeeded by strength and courage. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div align="justify"><big><font color="#000000"
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><big>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a lesson for ministers and others who are laboring
for the salvation of souls. Those who believe that we have the truth,
that God has made us the depositaries of his law, should manifest the
same earnestness and zeal that characterized Nehemiah. If ministers are
inactive and irresolute, destitute of godly zeal, what can be expected
of those to whom they minister? In some instances they may rise above
the moral level of their teachers, but not often. But when ministers
broaden their plans, and show that they are in earnest, the people will
respond to their efforts; and disunited, dispirited workers will become
united, strong, hopeful, and eager. </big></font></big></div>
  <div align="justify"> </div>
  <div>
  <div align="justify"><font color="#000000"
 face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="3"><big><font
 face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a sin to be heedless, purposeless, and indifferent in
any work in which we may engage, but especially in the work of God.
Every enterprise connected with his cause should be carried forward
with order, forethought, and earnest prayer. Faithful standard bearers
for God and his truth are wanted, and many are ready to respond to the
call. As these see the iniquity and violence that exist in consequence
of making void the law of God, they will see greater reason than ever
to reverence that law, and will greatly prize its righteous,
restraining influences. Contempt and reviling increases their love for
the precepts of Jehovah. With David they will say, "It is time for
thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy law. Therefore I love
thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold." <i>&#8213; Advent Review
