  size="3"> Council of Trent says: &quot;If any man shall declare that men are
  justified without the righteousness of Christ, through which he has obtained
  merit for us, or that <i>through that righteousness itself they are formally
  justified;</i> let him be accursed.&quot; *&nbsp; &quot;If any man shall say
  that justifying faith is nothing else <i>but confidence in the divine mercy,
  forgiving sins for Christ's sake; or that this confidence is the only thing by
  which we are justified; let him be accursed.</i>&quot; <font
  face="Times New Roman">†<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Council of Trent boastfully declared that it was
  &quot;Lawfully assembled in the Holy Spirit,&quot; at the beginning of every
  important decree; meaning that its decisions were all prompted by him who
  moved holy men of old to write Scriptures. Examine these two canons in the
  light of the Spirit's revelations. The first curses those who say that men are
  formally justified through Christ's righteousness; the second curses those who
  say that confidence in the divine mercy forgiving sins for Christ's sake is
  the only thing by which we are justified.&nbsp; Paul comes under this curse,
  for he says (Catholic version, Rom. iii. 28): &quot;For we account a man to be
  justified <i>by faith without the works of the law.</i>&quot; And if inspired
  Paul arrived at such a conclusion, we may safely sit down beside him and let
  the Council of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Spirit, curse him and us.</font></font></p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The decree on
  justification has sixteen chapters and thirty-three canons; it is very
  elaborate, and contains some truth and much pernicious error. Take it
  altogether, it is one of the most self-contradictory, gospel-denying, and
  detestable efforts which one could well imagine.</font></p>
