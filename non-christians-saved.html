  <p><strong>1260&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&quot;Since Christ died for all, and since 
  all men are in fact called to one and the same destiny, which is divine, we 
  must hold that the Holy Spirit offers to all the possibility of being made 
  partakers, in a way known to God, of the Paschal mystery.&quot;<sup>62</sup> Every 
  man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church, but seeks the 
  truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it, can 
  be saved. It may be supposed that such persons would have <em>desired Baptism 
  explicitly</em> if they had known its necessity.</p>

    by the sacraments of the Church unto salvation, and they alone can receive 
    an eternal recompense for their fasts, their almsgivings, their other works

    <p>Galatians 2:7 But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me [Paul] was 
    committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of the 
    circumcision. <br>
    Galatians 2:8 (For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the 
    circumcision, wrought in me [Paul] also among the Gentiles.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here we see from the epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Galatians that 
  Peter's commission was to preach to the Jews (the circumcision) while Paul's 
  commission was to the Gentiles (the uncircumcision). But today, the Pope, the 
  Vatican and other Catholics are teaching that <i>the Jews need not become 
  Christians in order to be saved</i>. They are, in fact, <i>repudiating</i> the 
  commission of Peter to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the Jews as 
  completely unnecessary! This teaching could be correctly described as being <i>
  antichrist</i>.</p>
