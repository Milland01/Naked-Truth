  and the Separation of Church and State</font></p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="heading"><b>Amendment I</b></p>
    <p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or 
    prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, 
    or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to 
    petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Now as most anyone with a grade school education can plainly read, the 
  first amendment of the United States Constitution limits only the legislative 
  authority of the House and Senate of the United States (Congress). No other 
  governmental body is mentioned, at either the federal or state level. Clearly 
  this amendment was intended to prevent the federal government from meddling in 
  the free exercise of religion by denying Congress the authority to enact laws 
  that regulate churches / houses of worship (an establishment of religion), or 
  the freedom to worship God as one deems appropriate, but that is the total 
  extent of the 1st amendment regarding religion. Although it does not 
  specifically mention religion, the 14th amendment also applies:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="heading"><b>Amendment XIV</b></p>
    <p><b>Section 1.</b><br>
    All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
    jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State 
    wherein they reside. <u>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall 
    abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;</u> 
    ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So this part of the 14th amendment prohibits the States from restricting, 
  by law, liberties granted by the U.S. Constitution, which includes religious 
  freedom as mentioned in the 1st amendment. The amendment continues:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, 
    without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction 
    the equal protection of the laws.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That part of the 14th amendment prohibits State governments from taking 
  away a person's life (by execution), liberty (by imprisonment), or private 
  property (by seizure), without the procedure of law being followed. The 
  amendment also guarantees equality under the law to everyone.</p>
  <p>So, I ask you, what jurisdiction does a <i>federal</i> judge have in the 
  matter of Alabama's Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore displaying the 10 
  Commandments in the rotunda of Alabama's judicial building? <u>None</u>, 
  because it is certain that the Constitution of the United States does not give 
  the federal government competency, authority or jurisdiction in the matter, 
  since it does not involve any <u>legislative act</u> of the U.S. Congress (1st 
  amendment) or the state of Alabama, or the unlawful deprivation of life, 
  liberty, or property by federal or state authorities (14th amendment).</p>
  <p>Whether you agree or not with what judge Moore has done, he simply has not 
  done anything that can be deemed &quot;unconstitutional&quot;, at least with regard to 
  the 1st and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The federal government 
  simply has no authority to dictate to the people of Alabama how they, or their 
  elected officials, choose to decorate their judicial building<i>,</i> since 
  architectural decorations on or in state buildings in no way involve a 
  deprivation of religious liberty to anyone in the state.</p>

  Constitution of the State of Alabama</a></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>There is an increasing tendency by Christians in America to defend the 
  public display of the Ten Commandments in the courtrooms and other state or 
  federal governmental buildings, in an effort to publicize the foundational 
  nature of God's Law in the fabric of the nation's legal system, and promote 
  their enduring value to the general welfare and safety of the public at large. 
  This puts the majority of Christian pastors in a very awkward position when it 
  comes to preaching the value of observing the Ten Commandments, because when 
  it comes to the Sabbath commandment (third by Catholic count, and fourth by 
  some Protestants), the Sunday keeping preacher needs to explain, somehow to 
  his congregation, just why it is that God's eternal law commands the keeping 
  of the <i>seventh</i> day (Saturday), but that is no longer valid<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;</font>that 
  God's Law has been changed, and it is now the <i>first</i> day of the week 
  (Sunday) that should be kept holy today by Christians.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A diligent search of the New Testament will discover no command from Jesus 
  or the Apostles to cease keeping the Sabbath, or that it has been replaced by 
  the first day of the week, yet the Sunday keeping Protestant pastor finds 
  himself in the predicament of exhorting his congregation to keep Sunday, in 
  striking contradiction to God's clear command to keep the seventh day Saturday 
  Sabbath. ... (<b><a href="gift_of_rest_rebuttal.html">More</a></b>)</p>
