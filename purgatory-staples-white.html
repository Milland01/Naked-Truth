  Debate on 1 Corinthians 3,
  James White Versus Tim Staples<br>
  January 28, 2010.</font></b></p>
  <hr>
    <p>The debate audio is <a href="http://aomin.org/aoblog/index.php?itemid=3749">available online.</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 3:6 I [Paul]&nbsp;have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the 
    increase<br>
    1 Cor 3:7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that 
    watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <br>
    1 Cor 3:8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man 
    shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. <br>
    1 Cor 3:9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye 
    are God's building. <br>
    1 Cor 3:10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise 
    masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But 
    let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<br>
    1 Cor 3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is 
    Jesus Christ.<br>
    1 Cor 3:12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious 
    stones, wood, hay, stubble;<br>
    1 Cor 3:13 Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall 
    declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try 
    every man's work of what sort it is.<br>
    1 Cor 3:14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall 
    receive a reward.<br>
    1 Cor 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he 
    himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Catholic apologist Tim Staples began his opening statement with this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;From a Catholic and biblical perspective, this is really <i>not</i> 
    difficult to see, in a nutshell, St. Paul, is here giving us a vivid picture 
    of the judgment, which is obviously after death, and he tells us that at the 
    judgment, and I know we will get some play on this, there will be some who 
    are already perfectly purified so that they will not experience the pains of 
    purgatory, but they will receive their reward immediately, and there are 
    those who will not have been perfectly sanctified, so they will undergo a 
    purging of all imperfections so that they can enter into the glory of 
    heaven.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is a splendid example of eisegesis, reading into the text something 
  that is not there. </p>
  <p align="left"><u><b>BIBLICAL FORGIVENESS</b></u></p>
  <p>First, what does the bible teach about forgiveness of sin?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name 
    JESUS: for <strong>he shall save his people from their sins.</strong></p>
    <p>Mark 3:28 Verily I say unto you, <strong>All sins shall be forgiven unto 
    the sons of men</strong>, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall 
    blaspheme:</p>
    <p>Col 2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your 
    flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having <strong>forgiven you all 
    trespasses</strong>;</p>
    <p>Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of 
    you in the name of Jesus Christ <strong>for the remission of sins</strong>, 
    and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p>Acts 10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name
    <strong>whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</strong></p>
    <p>1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have 
    fellowship one with another, and <b>the blood of Jesus Christ his Son 
    cleanseth us from all sin.</b><br>
    ...<br>
    1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us 
    our sins, and to <strong>cleanse us from all unrighteousness</strong>.</p>
    <p>Rev 1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first 
    begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him 
    that loved us, and <strong>washed us from our sins in his own blood</strong>,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Scripture teaches sin will be forgiven by Christ. So just how is sin forgiven?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and 
    without shedding of blood is no remission.<br>
    <br>
    Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life 
    through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sin cannot be remitted by subjecting the sinner to fiery torment and pain. 
  The law demands the shedding of blood, death, to atone for sin. The Gospel 
  message is that Christ has taken your sins to the cross, and offers His death 
  in your place:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto 
    them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto 
    salvation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These are the only choices. Die for your own sins, or let Christ's 
  death pay your penalty that the law demands. No amount of pain and suffering 
  on your part can remit your sins. To assert that your sins can be remitted by 
  your own suffering, is to reject the Gospel message of salvation through the 
  atoning death of Christ, that is blasphemy and antichrist.</p>
  <p align="left"><u><b><font size="4">&quot;THE DAY&quot;: 1 COR 3:13</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Second, Paul in the 3rd chapter of 1st Corinthians says nothing about a 
  judgment that occurs at the time of ones death. Mr. Staples is attempting to 
  force the Catholic teaching of a
  <a href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1022.htm">particular judgment</a> 
  into the text, 
  which is alleged to occur immediately when one dies, resulting in one 
  immediately being 
  sent to burning torment in Hell forever, burning torment in purgatory to be 
  cleansed and made holy for heaven, or directly to heaven, for those who are 
  already perfect. Paul in 1 Cor 3:13 mentions &quot;the day&quot; when a man's work will 
  be manifested and rewarded (vs. 8 &amp;14), and he further explains  when this test of a man's 
  work will occur in the following chapter:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, <u>until the Lord come</u>, 
    who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make 
    manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of 
    God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul is not saying that some bound for heaven must be tormented with fire 
  to purge their sins, or that those who are already perfect will escape this 
  infliction of cleansing pain. He is saying that the quality of ones work will 
  be judged, and rewarded accordingly, that this judgment of the church will 
  occur at the return of the Lord at His second coming, when Christ will reward 
  His faithful servants for the work they have done in building the church by 
  preaching the Gospel. Matthew corroborates this:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 16:27 <font color="#FF0000">For the Son of man shall come in the glory 
  of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to 
  his works.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The kingdom parables of the faithful servants in Matt 25:21, 23, the 
  parable of the talents, and the parable of the pounds, Luke 19:12-27, 
  consistently teach the exact same lesson, that on the day the Lord returns He 
  rewards his faithful servants according to the value of the work they have 
  done. The same is true for the kingdom parable of the laborers in the vineyard 
  (Matt 20), which&nbsp; also teaches that compensation is given to everyone as 
  a group, when the work is completely finished. John the Revelator also teaches 
  that these rewards are given at the second coming:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:12 <font color="#ff0000">And, behold, I come quickly; and my 
    reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In 1 Cor 3:12-15 Paul alludes to the second coming of Christ as described 
  in Malachi, which also explains &quot;the day&quot;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 3:2 But who may abide <u>the day of his coming</u>? and who shall 
    stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' 
    soap: <br>
    Mal 3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall 
    purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may 
    offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.<br>
    ...<br>
    Mal 4:1 For, behold, <u>the day cometh</u>, that shall burn as an oven; and 
    all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day 
    that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave 
    them neither root nor branch. <br>
    ...<br>
    Mal 4:5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before <u>the coming of 
    the great and dreadful day of the LORD:</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Malachi, Matthew, the kingdom parables, and Revelation do <i>not</i> teach that a 
  man is rewarded individually at the moment his particular work is done, at the 
  end of his life, rather they teach that the entire church receives due reward 
  together, at the same time, on the day of the Lord's second coming, when each 
  man's work is tested as by a refining fire. On that day, all work professed to 
  be in service to the Lord will be judged, only that work that 
  was precious and profitable to the Lord will stand and merit reward, anything 
  less that he did will be worthless, though the man himself will be saved (1 
  Cor 3:15).</p>
  <p>So the Catholic teaching of purgatory is clearly refuted by Scripture.</p>
