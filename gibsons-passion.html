<title>Why I Have No Interest In Seeing Gibson's The Passion of the Christ
</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">Why I Have No Interest In Seeing Mel Gibson's<br>
  </font><font size="6">The Passion of the Christ.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">The first and foremost reason is Mel Gibson's stated intent to 
  make his film as graphically shocking as he possibly could. He said on Fox's 
  Oreilly Factor that he wanted to &quot;push the audience to the edge&quot;. He is 
  essentially inviting everyone to be close witnesses to a brutal and bloody 
  atrocity, not unlike hawking front row tickets to a gladiatorial spectacle in 
  the Coliseum. Will it draw crowds? Undoubtedly, just like any bloody crime or 
  accident draws those with a prurient and morbid curiosity. It is, in effect, 
  being marketed as an obscenity of violence and gore specifically crafted to 
  shock and appall, and <i>daring</i> everyone to view it. </p>
  <p align="left">In one interview I saw, it was said by someone that viewed the 
  movie that it presented the truth not found in scripture. Is that to say the 
  Bible was somehow negligent and lacking in truth? I think it is notable indeed 
  that the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion did not find this kind of 
  bloodthirsty sensationalism appropriate. I already fully understand what 
  Christ endured, and that it was the darkest moment in human experience, so I 
  have no need to let Mel Gibson shock me with his presentation of obscenely 
  gruesome and graphic details.</p>
  <p align="left">Second, this is <u>not</u> just a visual presentation of the 
  biblical account. A Roman Catholic, Mel Gibson also used artistic license as a 
  director, and the alleged revelations to Catholic stigmatic and visionary
  <a href="http://www.emmerich1.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm">
  Anne Catherine Emmerich</a>, to one degree or another, in determining the 
  content of his film. As a result, the film depicts events that are not in 
  scripture. One example: in the opening scene of the movie, Jesus crushes with 
  His heal the head of a serpent that comes out from under Satan's cloak (an 
  allusion to Genesis 3:15), after Satan taunts Him before His arrest in the 
  garden of Gethsemane. Another example is Mary cleaning up the spilled blood of 
  her son (See
  <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/commentaries/passion-passionofmel.html">
  The Passion of Mel Gibson</a> at Christianity Today). Curiously, an event that
  <i>is</i> described in scripture is omitted in the film, that being when Jesus 
  identifies Himself in Gethsemane by saying &quot;I am he&quot;, those who came to arrest 
  Him all fell backwards (John 18:4-6).</p>
  <p align="left">I would venture to say that Emmerich's <i>The Dolorous Passion 
  of Our Lord Jesus Christ</i> cannot be found in most Christian (read 
  Protestant) bookstores, precisely because of its dubious origin and 
  questionable account. Even Catholic authorities suspect that works attributed 
  to her may have been fabricated to some degree, according to Colin Donovan at
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/Emmerich.htm">EWTN</a>. Yet, 
  prominent Protestants are embracing and promoting this film as an appropriate 
  and powerful witnessing tool, more or less ignoring its negative aspects. Most 
  Protestants would probably have no interest in reading Emmerich at all, but 
  put it on the big screen and Protestants buyout theater seats in advance in 
  the multiple thousands. Needless to say, Catholics are pleasantly surprised, 
  though maybe somewhat puzzled at the overwhelming Evangelical Protestant 
  endorsement of what is a profoundly Catholic production. It is also worth 
  noting that Gibson's film is largely a presentation of the 5 Sorrowful 
  Mysteries of the Catholic Rosary, something the average Catholic will 
  recognize, but the average Protestant will likely be ignorant of.</p>
  <p align="left">So from what I do know of the film, some of which I have not 
  mentioned, I believe the emphasis and content of The Passion of the Christ is 
  quite unacceptable, and so I have no desire to see it at all. Also, if only 
  Protestants <i>really</i> knew their Bible prophecy, and were still aware of 
  how and why they became Protestants in the first place, there would not be the 
  lemming-like interest in seeing this very Catholic film. </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="6">Who Crucified Jesus Christ?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Mel Gibson's movie <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> has also 
  generated a storm of controversy over its portrayal of the Jewish leaders as 
  being responsible for Christ's crucifixion, thereby giving his film a distinct 
  anti-Semitic theme. Due to the pressure of the controversy, the final version 
  of the film is said to have been altered to remove the subtitle when the 
  Jewish crowd before Pilate said &quot;His blood be on us, and on our children&quot; 
  (Matt. 27:25), though the words are still spoken in Aramaic.</p>
  <p align="left">So did the Jews crucify Christ? The Bible <i>does</i> address 
  this issue clearly and directly:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 21:38 <font color="#FF0000">But when the husbandmen saw the son, they 
    said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us 
    seize on his inheritance.</font><br>
    Mat 21:39 <font color="#FF0000">And they caught him, and cast him out of the 
    vineyard, and slew him. <br>
    </font>...<font color="#FF0000"><br>
    </font>Mat 21:45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his 
    parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>
    <p>Mat 26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and 
    the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called 
    Caiaphas,<br>
    Mat 26:4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.</p>
    <p>John 5:16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay 
    him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.<br>
    John 5:17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.<br>
    John 5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not 
    only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making 
    himself equal with God.</p>
    <p>John 7:1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not 
    walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
    <p>Acts 2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man 
    approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did 
    by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:<br>
    Acts 2:23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge 
    of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</p>
    <p>Acts 2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God 
    hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p>
    <p>Acts 4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that 
    by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised 
    from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>
    <p>1 Th 2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which 
    in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your 
    own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:<br>
    1 Th 2:15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have 
    persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:<br>
    1 Th 2:16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, 
    to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the 
    uttermost.</p>
