      Rev. E. V. Hill, the renowned pastor of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist 
  Church in Los Angeles, died Monday, February 24th, 2003, at Cedars-Sinai 
  Medical Center in Los Angeles after two weeks of hospitalization for severe 
  pneumonia. Pastor Hill was frequently seen on the Trinity 
  Broadcasting Network, which is mourning his passing. 
  <p>This begs the question, 
  why didn't another TBN regular, Benny Hinn, who is famous for his healing 
  ministry, visit Pastor Hill in the hospital and miraculously heal him? Well, perhaps 
  it is not too late. Maybe 
  they will set Pastor Hill's casket in front a TV set tuned to TBN and let him 
  be resurrected by a &quot;This Is Your Day&quot; or &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; program?</p>
