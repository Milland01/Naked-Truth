The Apostles' Creed and 1 Peter 3:19-<br>
Did Jesus preach to spirits in Hades?</font></b></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>From the Apostles' creed-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was
    buried. He descended into hell. ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What? Jesus descended into Hell after his death? Just what did he do there?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 3:18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
    unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
    quickened by the Spirit:<br>
    1 Pet 3:19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;<br>
    1 Pet 3:20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of
    God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few,
    that is, eight souls were saved by water.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is a popular interpretation of this passage, in conjunction with the Apostles'
  Creed, that Jesus, after His death on the cross, descended into
  Hades/Hell/prison to preach to spirits there.</p>
  <p>(The Roman Catholics call this place that Jesus supposedly visited after
  His death &quot;limbus patrum&quot;, or limbo of the fathers. Here is a link
  to an article from the <em>1913 Catholic Encyclopedia</em> explaining <img

  href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09256a.htm">LIMBO</a> </b>online at New
  Advent, a Roman Catholic website.)</p>
  <p>It is interesting to note that the source of this fanciful story of Jesus
  preaching in Hell appears to be the Roman Catholic Church. Note the following
  quotes about article 5 of the Apostles' Creed from Catholic Catechisms:</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><em>What meaneth the fifth Article?<br>
    He descended into hell, the third day he arose again?</em></p>
    <p align="left">We must believe, that Christ's body lying in the grave, his
    soul descended into hell: not to suffer pains, as some heretics do say, but
    for consolation and comfort of many Fathers there, and out of that place
    (called <em>Lymbus Patrum</em>) he loosed the souls of the blessed Fathers
    from captivity, and carried them away with him: the third day he rose again
    from death to life, manifestly showing himself to his Disciples, eating with
    them, and speaking of the kingdom of God. (Matt. 8, Luke 14, Ephes. 4, 1 Cor.
    15, Acts 1.)</p>

    he descended into the lower parts of the earth?</p>
    <p>Q. Did he not descend to purgatory to free such as were there?<br>
    A. It is most probable he did according to 1 Pet. iii. 19, 20. 'Christ being

    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Q. What are we taught in the Fifth
    Article: He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Fifth Article of the Creed teaches us that the
    Soul of Jesus Christ, on being separated from His Body, descended to the
    Limbo of the holy Fathers, and that on the third day it became united once
    more to His Body, never to be parted from it again.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 Q. What is here meant by hell?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Hell here means the Limbo of the holy Fathers, that
    is, the place where the souls of the just were detained, in expectation of
    redemption through Jesus Christ.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 Q. Why were not the souls of the Holy Fathers admitted
    into heaven before the death of Jesus Christ?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The souls of the holy Fathers were not admitted into
    heaven before the death of Jesus Christ, because heaven was closed by the
    sin of Adam, and it was but fitting that Jesus Christ, who reopened it by
    His death, should be the first to enter it.</p>

    A. There were in Limbo when Our Lord descended into it the souls of all

    <p>Q. 403. Why did Christ descend into Limbo?<br>

    could be admitted into it till after the death of Our Lord; for He by His
    death would redeem us—make amends for our fall and once more open for us
    Heaven. Now from the time Adam sinned till the time Christ died is about
    four thousand years. During that time there were at least some good men,
    like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and others, in the world, who
    tried to serve God as best they could—keeping all the divine laws known to
    them, and believing that the Messias would some day come to redeem them.
    When, therefore, they died they could not go to Heaven, because it was
    closed against them. They could not go to Hell, because they were good men.
    Neither could they go to Purgatory, because they would have to suffer there.
    Where could they go? God in His goodness provided a place for them—Limbo—where
    they could stay without suffering till Our Lord reopened Heaven. Therefore,
    while Our Lord's body lay in the sepulchre, His soul went down into Limbo,
    to tell these good men that Heaven was now opened for them, and that at His
    Ascension He would take them there with Him.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>Who Are The Spirits In Prison?</u></font></b></p>
  <p>Let's take a close look at this passage in 1st Peter and see just what it
  is really saying. Verse 18 contains a parallelism, the same thought expressed 
  twice.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Pet 3:18</b> For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just
    for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ who was sinless, died once on the cross for sinners, and was 
  resurrected&nbsp; to reconcile sinners  with God, ...</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He died the death all we mortals must die, but He was raised to life by the 
  Holy Spirit. The parallelism above states twice that Christ died and was 
  resurrected.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Pet 3:19</b> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in
    prison;<br>
    [The word translated preached G2784. kerusso, is also properly translated as 
    proclaim. See Rev 5:2. So it does not necessarily refer to preaching the 
    gospel.]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Verse 19 says that in His resurrected state (By which), Christ went and 
  proclaimed his victory over the spirits in prison. So who are these spirits? 
  Verse 22 parallels and restates verse 19:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><b>1 Pet 3:22</b> Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; 
  angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The spirits in prison refers not to people, but fallen angels and 
  authorities and powers who are also spoken of as being chained:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Eph 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against 
  principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this 
  world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>
  <p>Col 2:15 And [by His resurrection] having spoiled principalities and 
  powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them [fallen angels] in 
  it.</p>
  <p>Rev 20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the 
  bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<br>
  Rev 20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, 
  and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,<br>
  Rev 20:3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal 
  upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years 
  should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.<br>
  ...<br>
  Rev 20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of 
  his prison,</p>
  <p>Jude 1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their 
  own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the 
  judgment of the great day.</p>
  <p>2 Pet 2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down 
  to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto 
  judgment;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>1 Peter 3:20 and 21 speak of Noah's experience with the flood, and Christ's 
  death and resurrection, as types of baptism, in which the sinner can gain, and 
  proclaim,&nbsp; victory over sin and death:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><b>1 Pet 3:20</b> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the 
  longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a 
  preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.<br>
  <b>1 Pet 3:21</b> The like figure [of death and resurrection] whereunto even 
  baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, 
  but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus 
  Christ:</p>
  <p>Rom 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like 
  as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we 
  also should walk in newness of life.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So properly understood, this passage of 1 Peter 3:18-20 does not teach that 
  Jesus preached to spirits of dead people in Hell or purgatory after His death on the cross, 
  it simply does not validate a
  belief in an intermediate &quot;prison&quot; or limbo for immortal souls between death
  and heaven, as some teach today. When Christ died on the cross, He was buried,
  and did <i>nothing</i> until His resurrection. He went nowhere and preached to
  no one during the time period between His crucifixion and resurrection. Dead
  is dead.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><u><font size="5">Paradise and the Thief on the Cross.</font></u></b></p>
  <p align="left">Some will look the the thief on the cross and assert that
  &quot;paradise&quot; is not heaven, but this &quot;limbo&quot; or holding
  place in hades for the souls who died before Jesus was resurrected. It is
  easily proved that &quot;paradise&quot; IS in fact heaven:</p>
  <p>Jesus promises the thief that day that he will be with Him in paradise:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
    thou be with me in paradise.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the tree of life is also in paradise:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
    churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life,
    which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The tree of life is also placed as being in the New Jerusalem:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:2 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
    river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and
    yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the
    healing of the nations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And the New Jerusalem is described as descending *from heaven* after the
  millennium:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
    God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hence the promise made to the thief on that day was that he would join
  Christ in the New Jerusalem, in heaven, for the millennium. It is a promise
  yet to be fulfilled, which will happen at the second coming and the
  resurrection of the righteous dead.</p>
  <p>The Catholic teaching that paradise/limbo was a holding area in
  &quot;hell&quot; for souls, liberated when Jesus descended into hell after His
  death, is unfounded, a false tradition of men, and based on a complete
  misconception of the state of the dead. In addition to the Catechisms quoted
  above, this erroneous teaching can also be found in the Catechism of the
  Council of Trent,<b> </b>Article V of the Apostles' Creed<b> </b>and in the<b>
  </b>Vatican's new Catechism<b> </b>of the Catholic Church<b> <img
  src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/CDHN/creed7.html#DESCENDED">#631-637.</a></b></p>
  <p>The world faces a similar period of probation today, as it did in Noah's
  day. Soon the Gospel message will be preached a final time, the last person
  will accept Jesus Christ into his or her heart and mind, and the door of
  probation will then close as it did on the Ark of Noah. At that point all
  humanity will have had their fate decided and the plagues of God will then
  fall on the wicked of the world, as explained in Revelation, which will
  immediately precede the second coming of Jesus. (The plagues on the wicked are
  the future counterpart to the flood of Noah.)</p>
  <p>In order to really understand this issue, you need to know the truth about
  both <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a href="death.html">Death</a>
  </b>and <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a href="hell.html">Hell</a>
  </b>as taught by the Bible. It should then be clear that Jesus could not
  possibly have gone to a place called Hell/Hades/limbo after His death on the
  cross, since Hell is nothing more than the grave. Those who died before the
  time of Christ were not held captive as conscious spirits in any intermediary location after their
  deaths, because death is clearly a sleep of non-existence until one's
  resurrection.</p>
