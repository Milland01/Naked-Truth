  align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="273" height="257"> On January 2,
  1997, the rotunda of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem
  was unveiled following an extensive renovation. The Church of the Holy
  Sepulchre is believed by many Christians to have been built on the exact
  crucifixion site and tomb of Jesus Christ.
  <p>While the design used for the rotunda is an <em>obvious</em> pagan
  sunburst, the stated theme of the design is declared to be that of the glory
  of God enveloping the risen Christ. It consists of 12 golden rays, said to
  represent the 12 Apostles. Each of the 12 rays is said to consist of 3 streams
  of light, symbolizing the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The background is the
  color of mother-of-pearl, said to be symbolic of the Biblical luminous cloud
  that accompanies the presence of God. Finally, on the perimeter of the rotunda
  is a field of 120 stars.
  <p>Far from depicting the risen Christ, this design is clearly a pagan
  sunburst, cleverly redefined in the guise of Christian terms. The <img

  href="http://www.birzeit.edu/palnews/sepulchre/process5.html">gold cross</a> </b>on
  the top of the same dome also deserves mention. As you will see, it closely
  resembles a pagan sunwheel.</p>
