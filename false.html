OF REVELATION</font></strong></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>The false prophet is mentioned as such, 3 times in the book of Revelation.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 16:13 (KJV) &quot;And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out
    of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of
    the mouth of the false prophet.&quot;</p>
    <p>Rev 19:20 (KJV) &quot;And the beast was taken, and with him the false
    prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that
    had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
    These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.&quot;
    <p>Rev 20:10 (KJV) &quot;And the devil that deceived them was cast into the
    lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and
    shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.&quot;
  </blockquote>
  The beast, as I have <a href="antichrist.html">shown previously</a>, is the
  Papacy or Roman Catholic Church. Revelation 19:20 is the key to identifying
  who the false prophet is. Here it associates the false prophet with miracles
  performed for the beast. This is a link to Rev 13:11-14 where the same
  miracles are performed by a second beast with two horns like a lamb, that
  speaks like a dragon. So this second lamb-like beast is also the false
  prophet.
  <p>Now to identify just who the false prophet is, we need to look at Rev
  13:10, which will give us a time hack-
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that
    killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience
    and the faith of the saints.</p>
  </blockquote>
  This is a reference to Pope Pius VI being held captive in jail by Napoleon in
  1798 where he died as a prisoner. The Roman Catholic Church was broken as a
  political power at that time. This is the head wound to the first beast or
  Papacy spoken of in Rev 13:3-
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his
    deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</p>
  </blockquote>
  This head wound to the political power of the Papacy was healed in 1929 when
  Italy's Benito Mussolini signed the <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <strong><a href="wound.html">Lateran Treaty</a> </strong>with the Pope,
  establishing the Vatican as a City State with full diplomatic rights.
  Newspapers at the time proclaimed the &quot;wound&quot; to the Vatican and the
  papacy to be healed.
  <p>It is immediately following the time hack of Rev 13:10, which we have
  established as 1798, that a second beast, lamb-like in appearence, comes to
  power on the world scene-
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that
    killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience
    and the faith of the saints.<br>
    Rev 13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had
    two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.<br>
    Rev 13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and
    causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast,
    whose deadly wound was healed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  The second beast comes up as a lamb (a nation that professes to be Christian)
  from the land. Note the first beast came from the sea. The sea represents a
  multitude of people (Rev 17:15). So the first beast arises from a densely
  populated area, Europe. The second beast, however arises from a sparsely
  populated area, since it arises from the land and not the sea.
  <p>The beast from the sea had crowns on it's horns, a symbol of kingly
  absolute authority, but the second lamb-like beast has no crowns- it is a
  democracy!
  <p>This exactly describes the United States arriving on the world scene as a
  world power to reckon with in the early 1800's. It began as a democratic
  Christian nation, and rose to power on the world scene immediately following
  the apparent demise of Roman Catholic Church in 1798.
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:12 And he (the lamb-like beast) exerciseth all the power of the
    first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein
    to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
    Rev 13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from
    heaven on the earth in the sight of men,<br>
    Rev 13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those
    miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them
    that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which
    had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Verse 12 is saying that the United States will combine Church and State and
  strictly enforce apostate Catholic religious doctrine, just like the Roman
  Catholic church did in the middle ages! Yes! The current effort on the part of
  evangelical Christians to &quot;take back America&quot; will succeed!</p>
  <p>In Verse 13 it shows us that this revival of Church and State in the U.S.
  will be accompanied by great wonders (miracles). The fire coming down from
  heaven is a deceiving miracle, a false wonder, that may well refer to a
  counterfeit outpouring of the Holy Spirit! Already today a false manifestation
  of tongues, holy laughter etc. is sweeping churches in North America!
  <p>In verse 14 the lamb-like beast (the United States) promotes an image to
  the first beast (the Roman Catholic Church). When it says &quot;an image to
  the (first) beast&quot;, it means that the apostate Protestant movement in the
  United States will encourage the establishment of Church/State power, and
  legislate it's religious agenda on everyone. It will be the mirror
  &quot;image&quot; of the satanic practices, policies and persecutions of the
  Roman Catholic Church of the Middle Ages.
  <p>So using false miracles as proof of it's authority, the apostate Protestant
  church in the United States will take control of the government and pass
  religious legislation to enforce it's agenda, and it will promote false
  Catholic doctrines. What false doctrines, you might ask?
  <p>1. When you are dead, you are not dead. Your conscious self or spirit waits
  at some bus stop (purgatory) between here and heaven. Here you are free to
  listen to the prayers of the living and forward these petitions for grace to
  Mary or Jesus.<br>
  - They cannot accept that the wages of sin is death. Death includes the loss
  of any consciousness of the mind. Those who are dead hear nothing and can do
  nothing, for themselves or anyone else.
  <p>2. Salvation is obtained through ministers or priests of the church. They
  have a bank account with Jesus and can dispense grace or forgiveness to those
  they favor. Conversely, they can cut off your source of forgiveness if you do
  not accept their unscriptural traditions.<br>
  - No church can dispense or withhold forgiveness, forgiveness is yours from
  God through faith.
  <p>3. They worship on a day chosen by a pagan emperor of Rome, Sunday,
  although there is absolutely NO scriptural evidence that Jesus commanded such
  a change in the Ten Commandments.<br>
  - The Sabbath is Saturday without question. It is a memorial to Jesus the
  Creator, who worked six days and rested on the seventh. To worship on any
  other day is to reject the Creator, reject God, reject Jesus. Whom do you
  worship if you reject the 10 commandments of God?
  <p>4. We are saved by good works. God is keeping track of everything we do and
  the sum total of our good works better add up to a bigger number than our
  sins. Even &quot;good&quot; people who have rejected Jesus, will by this
  logic, have a chance so long as their good works total is high enough.<br>
  - Your works amount to nothing without faith. By the same token, faith without
  works is a dead faith.
  <p>So the False Prophet is in fact, apostate Protestantism based in the United
  States. How do you recognize apostate religion? Try the following additional
  indicators, note that they are accompanied by a serious lack of meaningful
  scriptural study.
  <p>A. Theology that preaches that God is a loving God and most people will be
  saved if only they will just be good people. You will see a lot of country and
  western style gospel singers, a lot of praising Jesus and binding Satan,
  collecting the tithe, but precious little scripture study, and what little
  there is, is very shallow.
  <p>B. The happy Christian, it is O.K. to be rich, send us your seed money
  today and you will get it back 1000 fold, kind of religion. A primary focus on
  God rewarding his followers with earthly riches. If only you will send in your
  love gift, God will reward you financially. And by the way, we have some neat
  things to send you if you contribute today- (mostly tapes, books, plaques,
  glasses, sculptures, lifetime memberships, get your name engraved on the
  churches top givers plaque, etc.) You could almost call it the Christian
  Shopping Network. Did Jesus sell *anything* during His ministry? No- what He
  offered was not for sale, it was FREE!
  <p>C. A focus on miracle healing of the sick, prayer requests and again
  endless pleas for donations, just to stay on the air.
  <p>D. A mission of building a TV or Radio station empire, from which there is
  little or no bible study, just more pleas for cash during long telethons, and
  praising Jesus. Usually broadcast from multi-million dollar lavish studios
  with lots of expensive decorations.
  <p>E. A primary reliance on speaking in tongues or other manifestations of the
  Holy Spirit to prove just how blessed of God they are. The fact that there is
  complete chaos and/or absolutely no interpreting of what is said in tongues,
  so that it can be checked against scripture, should be a warning sign-
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
    they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<br>
    1 John 4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
    that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<br>
    1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in
    the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye
    have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>
  </blockquote>
  F. Study of early Christian documents that &quot;shed light&quot; on what you
  should really know about Christianity. The Didache and the books of the
  Apocrypha, are examples. Limit yourself to the Bible for what you should
  believe. Everything you need for salvation is in it. Nothing needs to be
  added.
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
    prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add
    unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</p>
  </blockquote>
  G. Strong political activism to enforce &quot;Christian standards&quot; on the
  ungodly. I would remind you that Jesus did not endorse political candidates,
  protest government policy, run for office, or advocate political force. Jesus
  does not force anyone to do anything. We all have free choice to make our own
  decisions. The battle of evangelism will not be won from public office or the
  courtroom, but with the true word of God, scripture.
  <p>Some would consider such criticism to be hurtful, divisive, and lacking in
  Christian spirit. I would remind you I am describing the False Prophet to you.
  Following him and his superficial form of religion will result in the lake of
  fire! Many will fall into this enticing trap. Here is proof:
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:21 (KJV) &quot;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
    enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
    which is in heaven.&quot;<br>
    Mat 7:22 (KJV) &quot;Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we
    not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy
    name done many wonderful works?&quot;</p>
    <p>Mat 25:11 (KJV) &quot;Afterward came also the other virgins, saying,
    Lord, Lord, open to us.&quot;
    <p>Luke 6:46 (KJV) &quot;And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the
    things which I say?&quot;
    <p>Luke 13:25 (KJV) &quot;When once the master of the house is risen up, and
    hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the
    door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto
    you, I know you not whence ye are:&quot;
  </blockquote>
  These verses say that many, at the time of judgment, will call on Jesus name.
  They will claim to know him, claim to have performed miracles in his name,
  claim to have prophesied his coming, claim to have done many wonderful things
  in his name, and Jesus will reject them! Why? Because they were false prophets
  who did not know the truths of the Bible and did not follow his commandments.
  They led people astray and taught only what suited them and their pursuit of
  earthly gain and riches. God rejects them and their followers. Their numbers
  are many as Mat 7:22 states. Many think they are saved and are deceived!
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
    commandments.<br>
    1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
    liar, and the truth is not in him.<br>
    1 John 2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
    perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  Read all the verses quoted in their full context. Study them. The Bible has
  what you need to know. If you seek only the truth, and admit that there is
  nothing you can do to save yourself, and are willing to follow the truth
  anywhere it leads, you will open yourself to the Holy Spirit. He will guide
  you to know the truth, the way, and the light from scripture.
