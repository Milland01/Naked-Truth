<blockquote>
  <p>In an attempt to support Roman Catholic Tradition, and discredit Sola 
  Scriptura, you may hear the claim made by Catholics that Jesus never told any 
  of his disciples to write anything down, and clearly never wrote any of the 
  scriptures Himself. For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Is it not strange that if Christianity were to be learned from the Bible 
  only, that Christ Himself never wrote a line, nor ever commanded His apostles 
  to write. Only five of the twelve did write; for their divine commission was 
  not to write, but to preach and teach the gospel (Matt. xxviii. 19; Mark xvi. 
  15; Luke x. 16; Acts i. 8). They wrote merely to confirm their teaching, never 
  giving the slightest intimation that Christianity was to rest solely on a 
  Bible foundation.&quot;</p>

  Paulist Fathers,  copyright 1903 by &quot;The Missionary Society of

  </blockquote>
  <p>So, they will say, this is a significant omission in the Bible, which in 
  their view severely undermines the validity of the Protestant principle. Turn 
  the attention of those making such claims to the book of Revelation. These 
  verses are quoted from the King James:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 1:1 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show
    unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and
    signified it by his angel unto his servant John:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that according to the first verse, the book of Revelation is in fact, 
  a revelation from Jesus Christ to John. Here is what Jesus said
  to John the Apostle and Revelator:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 1:11 Saying, <font color="#FF0000">I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What
    thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are
    in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto
    Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 1:19 <font color="#FF0000">Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,
    and the things which shall be hereafter;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 2:1 <font color="#FF0000">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith
    he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst
    of the seven golden candlesticks;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 2:8 <font color="#FF0000">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 2:12 <font color="#FF0000">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
    saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 2:18 <font color="#FF0000">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his
    feet are like fine brass;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 3:1 <font color="#FF0000">And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy
    works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 3:7 <font color="#FF0000">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
    things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of
    David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man
    openeth;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 3:14 <font color="#FF0000">And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These
    things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the
    creation of God;</font></p>
    <p>Rev 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
    are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit,
    that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</p>
    <p>Rev 19:9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
    unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the
    true sayings of God.</p>
    <p>Rev 21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
    new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, twelve times, and to seven different church communities, John the 
  Revelator is directed by Jesus to write what became scripture.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Well, did Jesus ever write anything down Himself, in His own hand? <br>
	Yes, He most certainly did!</p>

	2</span>&nbsp;And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the

	conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i>even</i> unto 
	the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
	</span></p>
	<p>Several 
  instances of Jesus telling a prophet to write a book are also found in the Old 
  Testament:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Exo 17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a 
  book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the 
  remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</p>
  <p>Exo 34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after 
  the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.</p>
  <p>Jer 30:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,<br>
  Jer 30:2 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the 
  words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</p>
  <p>Jer 36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of 
  Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,<br>
  Jer 36:2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I 
  have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the 
  nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto 
  this day.</p>
  <p>Isa 8:1 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write 
  in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.</p>
  <p>Hab 2:1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will 
  watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am 
  reproved.<br>
  Hab 2:2 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it 
  plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.<br>
  Hab 2:3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall 
  speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, 
  it will not tarry.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;We are warned that scripture is to remain inviolate as the word of 
  God and is not to be amended by additions or deletions.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Prov 30:5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put 
  their trust in him.<br>
  Prov 30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found 
  a liar.</p>
  <p>Rev 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the 
  prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add 
  unto him the plagues that are written in this book:<br>
  Rev 22:19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this 
  prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the 
  holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.<br>
  Rev 22:20 He which testifieth these things saith, <font color="#ff0000">Surely 
  I come quickly.</font> Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To those who would amend the word of God through the addition of the
  traditions and doctrines of men, even claiming their traditions are equal with scripture
  as the word of God and necessary for salvation, let them heed the warning
  given by Jesus Christ Himself.</p>
