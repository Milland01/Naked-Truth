<title>Greg Laurie's Sabbath Confusion</title>

<blockquote>

<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Times New Roman">Greg Laurie's Sabbath 
Confusion</font><hr>
</p>

  <p>On Monday Sept 27th, and Tuesday Sept 28th, 2004, Greg Laurie on his &quot;A New 
  Beginning&quot; radio program, discusses the fourth commandment in the program 
  titled &quot;What is Right &amp; Wrong?&quot; - Part 3 (<a href="http://www.harvest.org/store/display.php?olimit=0&amp;zid=1&amp;lid=1&amp;key1=T1090">T1090</a>). 
  In the boxes below are some of the points he raises, followed by my comments.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Exodus chapter 20 verse 8, &quot;Remember the Sabbath day by 
      keeping it holy.&quot; Now this command has produced more confusion and 
      misunderstanding than probably any of the others. Let's find out what this 
      is, and what it is not.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <p>Well, let's see if we can remove the confusion and clarify the matter.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">First of all, Sabbath, when God originally gave it, was 
      on Saturday, the last day of the week. The seventh day was set apart as a 
      day of rest because God rested on the seventh day after creation. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <p>Simple enough, the seventh day Saturday Sabbath is a <i>memorial to 
  creation</i>, and reminds us that were were created by God, and as His 
  creation we are responsible to Him. Nothing that happened at the cross changes 
  or abolishes this memorial rest.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">It was given, and this is very important, and I want you 
      to mark this well, to the Jewish people. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <p>Jesus says otherwise:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 2:27 And he [Jesus] said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">The 
    sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In other words, the weekly seventh day Sabbath is to be a benefit for all 
  mankind, not just the Jews. This will come to pass as prophesied by Isaiah:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Isa 66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, 
  shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name 
  remain.<br>
  Isa 66:23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and 
  from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith 
  the LORD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, the time is coming when all of humanity will observe the Sabbath.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">And let me say something that may shock you, but the fact 
      is, Christians really don't have all that much to do with this 
      commandment. Or let me say it another way, this commandment doesn't really 
      have all that much to say in its literal interpretation in the life of the 
      Christian, and let me tell you why. It was part of the old covenant. the 
      same covenant that commanded that an animal was to be sacrificed to atone 
      for the sins of the people. ...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <p>If the fourth commandment is a part of the old covenant, what about the 
  other nine commandments? Are they not a part of the old covenant too? Did the 
  new covenant abolish God's law?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 8:6&nbsp; But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much 
    also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon 
    better promises.<br>
    Heb 8:7&nbsp; For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place 
    have been sought for the second.<br>
    Heb 8:8&nbsp; For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith 
    the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with 
    the house of Judah:<br>
    Heb 8:9&nbsp; Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the 
    day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; 
    because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith 
    the Lord.<br>
    Heb 8:10&nbsp; For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel 
    after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and 
    write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be 
    to me a people:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The new covenant does not abolish God's ten commandment law, it writes it 
  in the hearts and minds of God's people.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">But here's just a few facts about the fourth commandment:<p>
      1.&nbsp; It is the only commandment that is not repeated in the New 
      Testament. Every other commandment we read about in the ten is repeated in 
      the New Testament. Most are made more stringent, but of all the New 
      Testament lists of sins, breaking the Sabbath is never mentioned again. 
      That's because is was given to the Jews, not the non-Jews.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days <u>the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and 
    all that in them is</u>, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD 
    blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the fourth commandment is referred to in these verses in 
Revelation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Rev 5:12 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to 
  receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, 
  and blessing.<br>
  Rev 5:13 And <u>every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under 
  the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them</u>, heard I 
  saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth 
  upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
  <p>Rev 10:6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, <u>who created 
  heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that 
  therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein</u>, that there 
  should be time no longer:</p>
</blockquote>
  <p>The fourth commandment is referenced in the book of Revelation in 
  conjunction with commandment keeping:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Rev 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the 
  everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
  nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
  Rev 14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the 
  hour of his judgment is come: and <u>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and 
  the sea, and the fountains of waters.</u><br>
  ...<br>
  Rev 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
  commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The fourth commandment is also cited in the book of Acts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Acts 4:24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with 
  one accord, and said, <u>Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and 
  earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</u><br>
  <br>
  Acts 14:15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of 
  like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these 
  vanities unto the living God, <u>which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, 
  and all things that are therein:</u></p>
</blockquote>
  <p>The keeping of the 10 commandments of God is mentioned repeatedly in the 
  New Testament, to those under the new covenant, the Christians, who have God's 
  law written in their hearts and minds.

  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">And I bring this up because there are groups that will 
      tell you if don't worship on Saturday you're not worshipping God properly. 
      Some will even say if you worship on Sunday it's the mark of the beast or 
      the Antichrist. That is <i>absolutely</i> false. ...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <p>Well, you first have to know the identity of the antichrist power the beast 
  (from the sea) of Revelation 13. Greg Laurie does not know or teach just who 
  this is, so how can he know what the mark of the beast is? For that identity 
  see the article <strong style="font-weight: 400"><a href="antichrist.html">The 
  Catholic Origins of Futurism and Preterism</a> which shows it is the papacy of 
  the Roman Catholic Church. Then see <a href="seal.html">The Seal of God and the 
  Mark of the Beast</a> for the Catholic Church's mark of authority over the law 
  of God. </strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">Obedience to God was the issue in the garden 
of Eden, and in the form of the fourth commandment, it will again be the issue 
before the second coming.</strong></p>

    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">2. Jesus never taught <i>anyone</i> to keep the Sabbath. 
      ...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good 
    thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?<br>
    Mat 19:17 And he said unto him, <font color="#ff0000">Why callest thou me 
    good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into 
    life, keep the commandments.</font><br>
    Mat 19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, <font color="#ff0000">Thou 
    shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, 
    Thou shalt not bear false witness,</font><br>
    Mat 19:19 <font color="#ff0000">Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou 
    shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</font><br>
    Mat 19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my 
    youth up: what lack I yet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in answer to the question regarding eternal life, Jesus omits those 
commandments dealing with worship of God. Can we logically conclude that because 
of its omission the commandment regarding worship of other gods (Exo. 20:3) had 
been abolished? No, it would be foolish to assume that. Had the commandment 
against bowing down before idols (Exo. 20:4-5) also been abolished? No. Had the 
commandment forbidding taking the name of God in vain (Exo. 20:7) been 
abolished? No. It is absurd to conclude these commandments were abolished by 
Jesus simply because He did not mention them. How can anyone conclude, then, 
that the one commandment that calls us to <i>remember the sabbath day to keep it 
holy</i> is not included when Jesus said, in answer to the question,
<font color="#ff0000">&quot;if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&quot;
</font>Surely the fourth commandment <i>was</i> included implicitly as a 
commandment to be kept. In the book of John, Jesus is quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>John 14:15&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">If ye love me, keep my commandments</font>.<br>
  <br>
  John 14:21&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">He that hath my commandments,</font>
  <font color="#ff0000">and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that 
  loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest 
  myself to him.</font><br>
  <br>
  John 15:10&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">If ye keep my commandments,</font>
  <font color="#ff0000">ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my 
  Father's commandments,</font> <font color="#ff0000">and abide in his love.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore Jesus <u>did</u> teach the keeping of the seventh day Sabbath when 
He said <font color="#ff0000">&quot;keep the commandments&quot; </font>or<font color="#ff0000"> 
&quot;keep my commandments&quot;.</font></p>

    <tr>
      <td width="100%">3. The Apostles never taught anyone to keep the Sabbath.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
<p>Again, from the Apostle John:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1 John 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his 
  commandments.<br>
  1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a 
  liar, and the truth is not in him.</p>
  <p>1 John 3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his 
  commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.<br>
  1 John 3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of 
  his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.<br>
  1 John 3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in 
  him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath 
  given us.</p>
  <p>1 John 5:2&nbsp; By this we know that we love the children of God, when we 
  love God, and keep his commandments.<br>
  1 John 5:3&nbsp; For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: 
  and his commandments&nbsp; are not grievous.<br>
  <br>
  2 John 1:6&nbsp; And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is 
  the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in 
  it.</p>

</div>
<p>There is no doubt that the Apostles met on Sunday, but
<strong style="font-weight: 400;">- <a href="firstday.html">Did the Apostles 
Abandon The Sabbath And Keep Sunday Instead To Honor The Resurrection?</a></strong></p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Colossians 2:16 says: &quot;Don't let anyone judge you by what 
      you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon or 
      Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; but the 
      reality is found in Christ. ...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
</div>
<p>The <i>shadow</i> sabbaths were part of the yearly festivals that were 
prophetic in nature. For example, Passover was prophetic of the crucifixion of 
Jesus, and had the associated sabbaths of the first and last days of Unleavened 
Bread. However, the seventh-day Sabbath is a <i>memorial to creation</i>, that 
will endure and be kept even on the new Earth by all humanity, as pointed 
out at the beginning of this article. See: <strong style="font-weight: 400">
<a href="shadow.html">The Shadow Sabbaths of Colossians 2:17</a>.</strong></p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFECEC">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">You see, in the old covenant one day was holy to the 
      Lord, in the new covenant every day is holy to the Lord.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p align="left">There is no Bible verse in the New Testament to support that 
assertion, so that is why Greg Laurie does not provide one. The Lord, however, 
commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor 
thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:<br>
Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that 
in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath 
day, and hallowed it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">So keeping the Sabbath day holy means resting. God does <i>not</i> 
command us to rest every day, He commands us to work six days, and then rest on 
the seventh day Sabbath, and that day is Saturday. And the seventh day 
(Saturday) is distinct in that it is the <i>only</i> day of the week God blessed 
and sanctified in all of scripture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: 
because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration:underline"><font size="5">Conclusion</font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">Any confusion about keeping the 
seventh day Sabbath can be cleared up from the Bible, and the New Testament 
teaching to keep the commandments of God. Nowhere does the New Testament 
teach that Sunday is to be observed to honor the resurrection. That is nothing 
but a Tradition of men.</strong></p>
