<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the early controversies in the church was that of the nature of God
  and the Trinity. In brief, in the 4th century, Arius, an elder in Alexandria
  began teaching that Jesus Christ was a created being, and that before being
  created by God the Father, Jesus did not exist. (This belief is now called
  Arianism). The archdeacon of Alexandria, Athanasius, opposed Arius, and in the
  synod of 321 Arius was deposed. In 325 Emperor Constantine convened the first
  ecumenical council at <nobr><b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/CENICAEA.TXT">Nicea </a></b></nobr>and
  the matter was considered. One faction or the other predominated over the
  following years, and Athanasius himself was banished as many as five times
  when Arianism prevailed.</p>
  <p>Eventually the church formulated and adopted the <b><img src="star.gif"
  width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/SOURCES/ATHANASI.TXT">Athanasian creed, </a></b>which
  declared Father, Son and Holy Spirit to be equal and co-eternal, affirming the
  doctrine of the trinity.
  <p>But what does the Bible say of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit?
  <p><strong><u>The Deity of God the Father</u></strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 6:27 <font color="#FF0000">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
    which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
    you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</font></p>
    <p>1 Cor 8:6 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
    things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
    and we by him.
    <p>Gal 1:1 Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus
    Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
    <p>Gal 1:3 Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord
    Jesus Christ,
    <p>Eph 6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the
    Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <p>Phil 2:11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
    to the glory of God the Father.
    <p>1 Th 1:1 Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the
    Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace
    be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
    <p>2 Tim 1:2 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace,
    from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
    <p>Titus 1:4 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
    and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
    <p>1 Pet 1:2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
    sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
    Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
    <p>2 Pet 1:17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
    there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved
    Son, in whom I am well pleased.
    <p>2 John 1:3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
    from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
    <p>Jude 1:1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them
    that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and
    called:
    <p>Luke 3:21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that
    Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,<br>
    Luke 3:22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon
    him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in
    thee I am well pleased.
  </blockquote>
  <strong><u>The Deity of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</u></strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 18:10 <font color="#FF0000">Take heed that ye despise not one of 
    these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always 
    behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, 
    saying, <font color="#FF0000">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup 
    pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying,
    <font color="#FF0000">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, 
    except I drink it, thy will be done.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 26:63 [NIV] But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, 
    &quot;I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, 
    the Son of God.&quot;<br>
    Mat 26:64 <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Yes, it is as you say,&quot;</font> Jesus 
    replied. <font color="#FF0000">&quot;But I say to all of you: In the future you 
    will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and 
    coming on the clouds of heaven.&quot;</font></p>
    <p>John 8:17 <font color="#FF0000">It is also written in your law, that the 
    testimony of two men is true.<br>
    </font>John 8:18 <font color="#FF0000">I am one that bear witness of myself, 
    and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.<br>
    </font>John 8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?
    <font color="#FF0000">Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if 
    ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</font></p>
    <p>John 9:35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found 
    him, he said unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Dost thou believe on the Son of 
    God?</font><br>
    John 9:36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on 
    him?<br>
    John 9:37 And Jesus said unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Thou hast both seen 
    him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</font><br>
    John 9:38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
    <p>John 10:30 <font color="#FF0000">I and my Father are one.</font><br>
    John 10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.<br>
    John 10:32 Jesus answered them, <font color="#FF0000">Many good works have I showed you from my
    Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</font><br>
    John 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not;
    but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</p>
    <p>John 13:13 <font color="#FF0000">Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
    </font>
    <p>Rev 1:8 <font color="#FF0000">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
    Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </font>
    <p>Eph 3:9 And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery,
    which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all
    things by Jesus Christ:
    <p>Col 1:12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
    partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:<br>
    Col 1:13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
    translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:<br>
    Col 1:14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
    of sins:<br>
    Col 1:15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every
    creature:<br>
    Col 1:16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
    are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions,
    or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
    <p>Col 2:8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, 
    after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after 
    Christ.<br>
    Col 2:9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.<p>John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
    the Word was God.<br>
    John 1:2 The same was in the beginning with God.<br>
    John 1:3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made
    that was made.<br>
    John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
    his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace
    and truth.
  </blockquote>
  The Word is identified as God and creator here in John, and the Word was made
  flesh, God incarnate. In conjunction with Ephesians 3:9 and Colossians
  1:12-16, this is clearly speaking of Jesus Christ as God and Creator.
  <p><strong><u>The Deity of the Holy Spirit.</u></strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to
    lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?<br>
    Acts 5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
    was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine
    heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  Here in verse 3, Peter says Ananias has lied to the Holy Ghost, and in the
  next verse Peter says Ananias has lied to God. Clearly then according to
  Peter, the Holy Spirit is indeed deity, a part of the Godhead. This is also
  apparent from the following verse in the book of Matthew-
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
    name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>
  </blockquote>
  According to Matthew, baptism is to be in the name of all three persons of the
  Godhead.
  <p>Also, according to Scripture, the Holy Spirit -
  <ul>
    <li>Participated in creation - Gen
      1:2</li>
    <li>Is a Comforter - John 14:26
    <li>Is eternal - Heb 9:14
    <li>Speaks - 1
      Tim 4:1; Rev 14:13
    <li>Teaches - John
      14:26
    <li>Reveals the future - Luke
      2:26
    <li>Bears Witness - Rom
      8:16
    <li>Guides to the truth - John
      16:13
    <li>Gives life (quickens) - Rom
      8:11; 1Pet 3:18
    <li>Reproves - John
      16:8
    <li>Makes Intercession - Rom
      8:26
    <li>Indwells the believer - 1 Cor
      6:19
    <li>Distributes gifts - 1 Cor
      12:11
    <li>Seals the believer - Eph
      1:13, 4:30
    <li>Invites the Sinner - Rev
      22:17
    <li>Can be Blasphemed - Mat
      12:31-32
    <li>Conceived Jesus in Mary - Mat
      1:20
  </ul>
  <p><strong><u>A Trinity, but only one God</u></strong>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 2:10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do
    we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the
    covenant of our fathers?</p>
    <p>Mark 12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
    truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:
    <p>Rom 3:30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by
    faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
    <p>1 Cor 8:6 But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all
    things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things,
    and we by him.
    <p>Eph 4:6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and
    in you all.
    <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
    man Christ Jesus;
    <p>James 2:19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
    devils also believe, and tremble.
  </blockquote>
  <strong><u>One God, Yet Triune</u></strong>
  <p>All three entities of the Trinity were present at the baptism of Jesus-
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
    baptized of him.<br>
    Mat 3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,
    and comest thou to me?<br>
    Mat 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him,<font color="#FF0000"> Suffer it to be so now: for thus
    it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</font> Then he suffered him.<br>
    Mat 3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the
    water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of
    God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:<br>
    Mat 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom
    I am well pleased.</p>
  </blockquote>
  So the Bible teaches that the Father, the Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy
  Spirit are all deity, each distinct, yet each part of the Godhead, but there
  is only one God. While difficult for humanity to comprehend, the Trinity is
  indeed the truth, not because of the creeds of men, but because it is taught
  by the Bible.
