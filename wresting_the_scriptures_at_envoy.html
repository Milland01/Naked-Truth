    also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he 
    was betrayed, took bread.<br>

    body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.<br>
    <b>25 </b>In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This 
    chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall

    <b>26 </b>For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice,

    the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the 
    Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now the following is an excerpt from <b>
  <a href="http://envoymagazine.com/backissues/4.6/apzone.htm">The Apologetics 
  Zone</a></b> article regarding the above passage from the apostle Paul:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="590" 
    bgcolor="#F2F2FF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><b>...</b> “Well, he says here that he received this 
        account of the Last Supper from the Lord. Gram, he wasn’t present at the 
        Last Supper. He never even knew Jesus before the Resurrection! This 
        information was given him by a third party. And yet, he equates that 
        with having received it from our Lord. So it would seem that even as 
        early as the New Testament, there is evidence of an apostolic succession 
        of Tradition, a handing on of ideas and development of doctrine.”
        <p><b>...</b></p>
        <p>“... Protestants claim there is no biblical basis for the oral 
        Tradition of the Church. Yet here St. Paul is saying that what he 
        received by way of spoken tradition, he thought of as revelation from 
        God. Then he goes on to develop an idea on top of that tradition. See, 
        look what it says here in verse 29: “For any one who eats and drinks 
        without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself.” This 
        isn’t a piece of doctrine from Jesus or the twelve apostles. It’s a 
        theological development from the oral tradition St. Paul had received. 
        Who could argue with that?” <b>...</b></p>
        <p>Excerpt from <b>
        <a href="http://envoymagazine.com/backissues/4.6/apzone.htm">The 
        Apologetics Zone</a> </b>online, by <font size="3">Caroline Schermerhorn.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Who could argue with that? First of all, it is necessary, apparently, to 
  define what the title <i>apostle</i> means in scripture and how it different 
  from a disciple. An apostle is one who received the gospel message directly 
  from Christ Himself, and not from any intermediary. There had to be direct 
  face-to-face instruction from Jesus Christ to qualify one as an apostle:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Luke 6:13</b> And when day was come, he [Jesus] called unto him his 
    disciples: and he chose twelve of them (whom also he named apostles):</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A disciple of Christ, on the other hand, is a follower of Christ's 
  teachings, but need not have ever met Him. Anyone can be a disciple of Christ, 
  but unless you have met and been chosen, taught and sent by Christ personally, 
  you are not, strictly speaking, an apostle. So the original 12 disciples, 
  called by Jesus Christ, taught by Him for 3 1/2 years, and sent out to the 
  world with the gospel message, are apostles. But what of Paul? He converted to 
  Christianity some 4 years or so after the crucifixion, and previously was a 
  zealous persecutor of Christians. Just how is Paul an apostle?</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>Paul, an Apostle of Christ</u></font></b></p>
  <p>The Apologetics Zone article would have you believe that Paul was taught 
  through oral Tradition from a third party (not Christ Himself) about the Last 
  Supper, and that Paul then builds on this oral Tradition to develop additional 
  doctrine on his own, which is also to be considered authoritative. Can it be 
  true? Are the authority of Catholic oral Tradition and doctrinal development 
  proved by the example of the apostle Paul? Wait - the <b>APOSTLE</b> Paul? How 
  is Paul an apostle? As most any student of the Bible will tell you, Paul 
  (known then at Saul) was converted as a result of an encounter with the risen 
  Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Acts 9:3 (KJV)</b> And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and 
    suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:<br>
    <b>4</b> And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him,
    <font color="#FF0000">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</font><br>
    <b>5</b> And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said,
    <font color="#FF0000">I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee 
    to kick against the pricks.</font></p>
    <p><b>Acts 22:6</b> <b>(KJV) </b>And it came to pass, that, as I made my 
    journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone 
    from heaven a great light round about me.<br>
    <b>7</b> And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,
    <font color="#FF0000">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</font><br>
    <b>8</b> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me,
    <font color="#FF0000">I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</font></p>
    <p><b>Acts 26:14</b> <b>(KJV) </b>And when we were all fallen to the earth, 
    I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue,
    <font color="#FF0000">Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for 
    thee to kick against the pricks.</font><br>
    <b>15</b> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, <font color="#FF0000">
    I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</font><br>
    <b>16</b> <font color="#FF0000">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I 
    have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a 
    witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in 
    the which I will appear unto thee;</font><br>
    <b>17</b> <font color="#FF0000">Delivering thee from the people, and from 
    the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</font><br>
    <b>18</b> <font color="#FF0000">To open their eyes, and to turn them from 
    darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may 
    receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified 
    by faith that is in me.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Following his conversion, and upon his arrival at Damascus, what did the 
  apostle Paul do?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Acts 9:20 (KJV)</b> And straightway he preached Christ in the 
    synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is why Paul is called an apostle, he did <i>meet face-to-face</i> with 
  Jesus, and he was taught by Jesus <i>directly</i>. However, this seems to be a 
  fact that Paul was constantly and repeatedly having to affirm to his audiences 
  and readers, given his previous infamous history of zealous persecution:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Rom 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an 
    apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
    <p><b>1 Cor 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ 
    through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</p>
    <p><b>2 Cor 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of 
    God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, 
    with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</p>
    <p><b>Gal 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but 
    by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</p>
    <p><b>Eph 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, 
    to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</p>
    <p><b>Col 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, 
    and Timotheus our brother,</p>
    <p><b>1 Tim 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the 
    commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</p>
    <p><b>2 Tim 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of 
    God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
    <p><b>Titus 1:1 (KJV)</b> Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus 
    Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the 
    truth which is after godliness;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Of these affirmations of his apostolic calling from Jesus, I would like now 
  to call attention to the first chapter of Galatians, which we will look at in 
  some detail.</p>
  <p>The remaining quotes of scripture are from the Catholic's own Douay Rheims 
  translation:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Galatians 1:1</b> Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by 
    Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul makes the point here that he was not called or taught by men, but by 
  Christ Himself. He is a genuine apostle of Christ, just as much as the other 
  twelve.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Galatians 1:2</b> And all the brethren who are with me, to the 
    churches of Galatia.<br>
    <b>3</b> Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord 
    Jesus Christ,<br>
    <b>4</b> Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this 
    present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:<br>
    <b>5</b> To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.<br>
    <b>6</b> I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into 
    the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.<br>
    <b>7</b> Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and 
    would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
    <b>8</b> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you 
    besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.<br>
    <b>9</b> As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a 
    gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul has given a very strong warning that anyone who does not preach the 
  same gospel as himself is anathema, which the King James equates to being 
  cursed by God. So now remember, the question is where did Paul get his 
  knowledge of the gospel? Was it from a third party, and not Christ? Paul 
  continues:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Galatians 1:10</b> For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to 
    please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.<br>
    <b>11 </b>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was 
    preached by me is not according to man.<br>
    <b>12 </b>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by 
    the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul is quite firm that he was taught <i>only</i> by Jesus, and <i>not</i> 
  by other men.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Galatians 1:13</b> For you have heard of my conversation in time past 
    in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of 
    God, and wasted it.<br>
    <b>14</b> And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals 
    in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my 
    fathers.<br>
    <b>15</b> But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, 
    and called me by his grace,<br>
    <b>16</b> To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the 
    Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.<br>
    <b>17</b> Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: 
    but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.<br>
    <b>18 </b>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I 
    tarried with him fifteen days.<br>
    <b>19</b> But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of 
    the Lord.<br>
    <b>20</b> Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie 
    not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Could anything be more clear? Having previously been a zealot for the 
  Tradition of men, Paul now categorically rejects the notion that he was taught 
  the gospel by men, not even by the other apostles. He makes the point that it 
  was fully three years after his conversion before he even met with an another 
  apostle, that being Peter, and only for a short 15 days.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Galatians 1:21</b> Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and 
    Cilicia.<br>
    <b>22</b> And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in 
    Christ:<br>
    <b>23</b> But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth 
    now preach the faith which once he impugned:<br>
    <b>24</b> And they glorified God in me.<br>
    <b>Galatians 2:1</b> Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to 
    Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If Paul is using his conversion on the road to Damascus as the reference 
  point, he is saying that in <i>fourteen years</i> of ministry, he spent a mere 
  15 days with Peter in Jerusalem, and that only after having preached for 3 
  years, beginning in the synagogues of Damascus (Acts 9:20). Paul was simply <i>
  not</i> taught by men, but only by the Lord Jesus Christ. With this truth 
  firmly in mind let's return to the first verse of the passage of scripture 
  cited by the article in <i>Envoy Magazine</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Corinthians 11:23</b> For I have received of the Lord that which 
    also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he 
    was betrayed, took bread.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who did Paul say he received his knowledge of the Last Supper from? The 
  Lord - not a third party, not from another apostle, or another disciple, or 
  any other person, but from Jesus Christ Himself, and that is precisely what 
  Paul meant. This, <i>Envoy Magazine</i> promotes as a validation of oral 
  Tradition from a third party? The apostle Paul is, without doubt, the absolute 
  worst possible candidate in scripture from which to attempt to validate 
  Catholic oral Tradition and doctrinal development, given his very clear 
  assertion that he was <i>not</i> taught by men, but directly by Christ. <i>The 
  view being promoted by <b>Envoy Magazine</b>, is in fact, the direct opposite 
  of Paul's very clear repeated teaching in scripture.</i></p>
  <p>This has to raise the question, just <i>how</i> did this article get into
  <i>Envoy Magazine </i>in the first place, particularly since it has top 
  billing on the cover? Are Patrick Madrid and <font size="3">Caroline 
  Schermerhorn completely ignorant of Paul's conversion in Acts, or his 
  testimony in the first chapter of Galatians? It would seem so. And who will 
  the article </font><b>
  <a href="http://envoymagazine.com/backissues/4.6/apzone.htm"><font size="3">
  The Apologetics Zone</font></a></b><font size="3"> convince regarding Catholic 
  oral Tradition? Surely only those equally unfamiliar with scripture and the <i>
  apostle</i> Paul. Let's again recall the very strong warning the <i>apostle</i> 
  Paul gives in his epistle to the Galatians:</font></p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>The Apostle Paul's Warning</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Galatians 1:6</b> I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that 
    called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.<br>
    <b>7</b> Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and 
    would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
    <b>8</b> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you 
    besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.<br>
    <b>9</b> As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a 
    gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><u><font size="4">The Apostle Peter on Twisting the 
    Scriptures of Paul</font></u></b></p>
    <p><b>2 Peter 3:14</b> Wherefore, dearly beloved, waiting for these things, 
    be diligent that you may be found before him unspotted and blameless in 
    peace.<br>
    <b>15</b> And account the longsuffering of our Lord, salvation: as also our 
    most dear brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, hath written to 
    you:<br>
    <b>16</b> As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in 
    which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and 
    unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own 
    destruction.</p>
