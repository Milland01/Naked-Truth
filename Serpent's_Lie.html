  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not 
    surely die:<br>
    Gen 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes 
    shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</p>

  <i><a href="CRH040807.mp3">Is There Really Life After 
  Death?</a></i> by Dr. D. James Kennedy, broadcast on the <a href="http://www.coralridge.org/">Coral 
  Ridge Hour</a>, Sunday, April 8, 2007. Here is a transcript of the 
  relevant portion:</font></p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">I can tell you this, I am not concerned about being put 
        into a casket and put into a grave. No one will ever shovel dirt on my 
        face. I am not going to be in a grave. You say ah! He is going to be, 
        what, buried at sea? No. I am not going to be in the gr[ave.] Oh, my 
        body will be in one. But when people are perhaps gathered around the 
        open hole in the ground, and perhaps a few tears are shed, I will be 
        looking down from paradise. I will be more alive than I have ever been 
        alive in my life. Not only am I never going to go into a grave, or a 
        casket, this may startle some of you, but I am never going to die. And 
        if you are planning to die I really feel sorry for you. How can you say 
        that? Jesus Christ said it. He said: <font color="#FF0000">&quot;I am the 
        resurrection, and the life: whosoever believeth in me, though he were 
        dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me <b><i>
        shall never die.</i></b>&quot;</font> [John 11:25-26] I live, I believe in him, I <i>will never die</i>. 
        Sorry about you.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Note that Dr. Kennedy has essentially repeated the serpent's lie. He will 
  not die, he will be even more alive [his eyes opened, knowing more], looking 
  down on his casket from paradise [as a god].</p>
  <p>So what of the quote from the book of John? What was Jesus really saying?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <font color="#FF0000">
    Lazarus is dead.</font><br>
    John 11:15 <font color="#FF0000">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not 
    there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</font><br>
    John 11:16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his 
    fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.<br>
    John 11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four 
    days already.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Lazarus, Jesus told them, was dead. And before Jesus arrived at the tomb, 
  Lazarus had been dead and buried for four days already. The discussion that 
  follows with Martha has as its focus the <i>resurrection on the last day:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my 
    brother had not died.<br>
    John 11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God 
    will give it thee.<br>
    John 11:23 Jesus saith unto her, <font color="#FF0000">Thy brother shall 
    rise again.</font><br>
    John 11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the 
    resurrection at the last day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the context of the conversation is the resurrection of the righteous 
  dead at the second coming. To that context Jesus explains:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 11:25 Jesus said unto her, <font color="#FF0000">I am the 
    resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, 
    yet shall he live:</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Lazarus was dead, but Martha knew he would be resurrected to life again at 
  the second coming. Jesus was affirming this, saying though a believer be dead 
  (like Lazarus), he will live again, meaning he will be resurrected to life at 
  the second coming. Then Jesus said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 11:26 <font color="#FF0000">And whosoever liveth and believeth in me 
    shall never die. Believest thou this?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That means: <i>whosoever is resurrected to life at the second coming will 
  live forever</i>, and not die the <i>second</i> death, as Revelation 20:6 
  clearly affirms:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: 
    on such the second death hath no power, ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Lazarus was not alive in heaven looking down on his tomb and grieving 
  relatives, only to be jerked back to earth by Jesus. He was dead, in the tomb, 
  knowing nothing (Eccl. 9:5), awaiting his resurrection. Jesus woke him from 
  the sleep of death (John 11:11), bringing him back to life. </p>
  <p>So it is, and will be, for all those who die in the faith. They are dead in 
  the grave, sleeping, awaiting their resurrection at the last trumpet:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 15:51 Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we 
    shall all be changed,<br>
    1 Cor 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for 
    the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we 
    shall be changed.<br>
    1 Cor 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
    must put on immortality.<br>
    1 Cor 15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and 
    this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the 
    saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.<br>
    1 Cor 15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
