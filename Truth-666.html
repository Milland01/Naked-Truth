  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ranging over the entire Christian era, <i>The Truth 
  About 666</i> is a penetrating 874-page book in three volumes for both 
  scholars and lay people concerned about past, present, and future events. This 
  is the most comprehensive work on prophecy and history ever produced by a 
  Seventh-day Adventist, with the assistance of excellent researchers and 
  scholars. About the earliest Christian centuries, it agrees with and defends 
  Ellen G. White’s <i>Great Controversy</i> as well as Uriah Smith’s <i>Daniel 
  and the Revelation</i>, but it adds much that neither of them dealt with. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, the Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths were not 
  really Arians but ancient Sabbathkeepers, who stood in the way of papal 
  supremacy. Therefore, they had to be eliminated. The popes were supported by 
  the kings and emperors of Europe in persecuting those who opposed the Roman 
  Church, yet for centuries they also struggled to dominate them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With amazing new discoveries in Latin as well as five other 
  languages, this book vindicates Uriah Smith’s conclusion that the 666 in Rev. 
  13:18 really refers to <i>vicarius Filii Dei</i> (the vicar of the Son of God). This 
  title first appeared during 753 in a document known as the Donation of 
  Constantine, which was forged by the papacy to claim ecclesiastic supremacy as 
  well as secular domination. The narrative of <i>The Truth About 666</i> is enlivened 
  by many fascinating episodes. For instance, it shows that the people of 
  Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, speak Portuguese, while the 
  others speak Spanish, due to a papal decision based on that fraudulent 
  manuscript. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is a storehouse of brand-new discoveries. One of 
  its treasures is an Appendix with material quoted from more than eighty 
  non-Seventh-day Adventist writers, mostly Protestants who lived and labored 
  before Uriah Smith. They testified to the fact that <i>vicarius Filii Dei</i> was 
  indeed a papal title. Most of them also showed that it had a number value of 
  666.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very many Catholic writers also bore witness to the fact that 
  the popes have for more than a thousand years been called the vicars of the 
  Son of God, in Latin as well as the other leading languages of Western Europe.
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its third volume, this book discusses the problem of some 
  Seventh-day Adventist scholars who now say that 666 does not refer to the pope 
  but only means human sinfulness or imperfection. Some of them also claim that 
  the number, the name, and the mark of the Beast are one and the same thing. By 
  implication, there will therefore be no Sunday laws, nor will America 
  cooperate with the papacy in its pursuit of world domination. Such ideas 
  undermine the third angel’s message, suggesting that Seventh-day Adventists 
  are not really the Remnant Church of prophecy. As <i>The Truth About 666 </i>
  demonstrates, these Seventh-day Adventist scholars have most unfortunately 
  been influenced by writers from outside their church: Sundaykeepers, 
  Protestants and Catholics, as well as others, including Spiritualists. </p>
