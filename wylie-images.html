<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two things are here to be determined; <i>first, </i>the 
  practice of the Church of Rome as regards images; and, <i>second, </i>the 
  judgment which the Word of God pronounces on that practice. </p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" 
    bordercolor="#111111" align="right" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img border="0" src="fatima_statue.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" 
        vspace="10" width="434" height="349"></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;<font size="2">Pope John Paul II kneeling in prayer 
        before the idol of Our Lady of Fatima</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her practice, so far as pertains to its outward form, is 
  as incapable of being misunderstood as it is of being defended. She sets up 
  images which are representations of saints, or of angels, or of Christ; and 
  she teaches her members to prostrate themselves before these images, to burn 
  incense, and to pray before them, to undertake pilgrimages to their shrine, 
  and to expect a more than ordinary answer to the intercessions offered before 
  them. There is not a church in any Roman Catholic country throughout the world 
  where this manner of worship is not every day celebrated; and, being open to 
  all, no concealment is possible, and none is sought. The worshipper enters the 
  cathedral, he selects the image of the saint whom he prefers, he kneels, he 
  counts his beads, he burns his candle, and, it may be, presents his votive 
  offering. As regards the letter of the practice of the Church of Rome, there 
  is not, and there cannot be, any dispute. These facts being admitted, the 
  controversy might here take end. This is what the Word of God denounces as 
  image-worship; this it strictly prohibits; and this is enough to substantiate 
  the charge which Protestants have brought against the Church of Rome as guilty 
  of idolatry. Her practice in this point is manifestly a revival of the pagan 
  worship in one of its grossest and most offensive forms. She, as really as the 
  ancient idolaters, &quot;worships the creature more than the Creator.&quot; But let us 
  hear what Rome has to say in her own behalf. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She introduces the element of INTENTION, and on this 
  mainly rests her defence. She pleads that she does not believe these images to 
  be inspired with the Divinity,—she does not believe them to be gods. She 
  pleads also, that she does not believe that the wood, or stone, or gold, of 
  which they are composed, can hear prayer, or that the image of itself can 
  bestow the blessings supplicated for; that she believes them to be only 
  images, and therefore directs her worship and prayers past or beyond them, to 
  the saint or angel whom the image represents. The Papist does not pray <i>to</i>, 
  but<i> through</i>, the image. We accept this as a fair statement of what is 
  the theoretic practice of the Church of Rome on the subject of images, but we 
  reject it as a statement of what that practice is, in fact, and especially do 
  we reject it as a defence of that practice. We do so for the following 
  reasons. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first place, if the Papist is acquitted of 
  idolatry on this ground, there is not an idolater on the face of the earth who 
  may not on the same ground demand an acquittal. None but the most ignorant and 
  brutish ever mistook the stock or stone before which they kneeled for the 
  Creator. This representative principle, on which the image-worshipper of the 
  Popish Church founds his justification, pervaded the whole system of the pagan 
  worship. It was this which led the world astray at first, and covered the 
  earth with a race of deities of the most revolting character. Whether it was 
  the heavenly bodies, as in Chaldea, or a class of demigods, as in Greece and 
  Rome, it was the great First Cause that was professedly adored through these 
  symbolizations and substitutes. The vulgar, perhaps, failed to grasp this 
  distinction, or steadily to keep it before them, just as the mass of 
  worshippers in the Roman Catholic Church fail practically to apprehend the 
  difference between praying <i>to</i> and praying <i>before</i>, or rather <i>
  beyond</i>, the image; but such <i>was </i>the system, and that system the 
  Bible denounced as idolatry; and the same system stands equally condemned when 
  found in a popish cathedral as when found in a pagan temple. </p>
  <div align="right">
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" 
    bordercolor="#111111" align="right" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td><img border="0" src="divine-mercy.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
        width="198" height="300"></td>

        in Krakow, Poland</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, in the second place, it is not true that these 
  images are simple helps to devotion, or mere <i>media </i>for the conveyance 
  of the worship offered before them to the object whom they represent. The 
  homage and honour are given to the image <i>immediately</i>, and to the object 
  represented <i>immediately</i>, the worshipper assuming the power, by an act 
  of volition or intention, of transferring the honour from the image to the 
  object. But the image is honoured, and is commanded to be so on no less an 
  authority than the Council of Trent. &quot;Moreover,&quot; says the Council, &quot;let them 
  teach that the images of Christ, and of the Virgin, mother of God, and of 
  other saints, are to be had and retained, especially in churches, and due 
  honour and veneration rendered to them.&quot; And the decree goes on to say, that 
  the person is to prostrate himself before the image, to uncover his head 
  before it, and kiss it, no doubt under the pretence, that by these marks of 
  honour to the image he is honouring those whose likeness it bears.<a 
  HREF="#[1]"><sup>1</sup></a><a NAME="1"></a></a> This decree reduplicates on a 
  former decree of the second Council of Nice, held in A.D. 787,<a HREF="#[2]"><sup>2</sup></a><a 
  NAME="2"></a></a> at which the controversy respecting images was finally 
  settled. The Council of Nice decreed that the images of Christ and his saints 
  are to be venerated and adored, though not with &quot;<i>true latria</i>,&quot;<i> </i>
  or the worship exclusively due to God.<a HREF="#[3]"><sup>3</sup></a><a 
  NAME="3"></a></a> The same doctrine is taught in the Catechism of the Council 
  of Trent. There such acts of worship as we have already specified are 
  recommended to be performed to images, for the sake of those whom they 
  represent; and it is declared that this is highly beneficial to the people, as 
  is also the practice of storing churches with images, not for instruction 
  simply, <i>but for worship</i>.<a HREF="#[4]"><sup>4</sup></a><a NAME="4"></a></a> 
  If, therefore, we find the divines of the Romish Church not adhering to their 
  own theory, but blending the image and the object in the same acts of 
  adoration, if we find them expressly teaching that images are to be 
  worshipped, though not with the same supreme veneration that is due to 
  God,—how can we expect that this distinction should be observed by the people?
  </p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" 
    bordercolor="#111111" align="left" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td><a href="http://www.initaly.com/regions/latium/church/aracoeli.htm">

        <p align="center">&nbsp;<font size="2">The Bambino</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>By the mass of the people this distinction is neither understood nor 
  observed: the image is worshipped, and nothing more. That is their deity; and 
  in not one in a thousand cases do the thoughts or intentions of the worshipper 
  go beyond it. Why, out of several images of the same saint, does the 
  worshipper prefer one to the others? Why does he make long pilgrimages to its 
  shrine? Why, but because he believes that a peculiar virtue or divinity 
  resides in this his favourite image. This shows that it is more to him than 
  simple wood and stone. There could not be grosser or more wholesale idolatry 
  than the festival of the Bambino at Rome, as described by Seymour.<a 
  HREF="#[5]"><sup>5</sup></a><a NAME="5"></a></a>
  <a href="http://www.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/saluspr.html">
  <img border="0" src="sproman1.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
  width="192" height="288"></a>When the priest on the summit of the Capitol 
  elevates the little wooden doll which represents the infant Saviour, the 
  thousands that cover the slope and bottom of the mount fall prostrate, and 
  nothing is heard but the low sounds of prayer addressed to the image. The Rome 
  of the Caesars never witnessed a more idolatrous spectacle. It is firmly 
  believed that the image possesses miraculous powers; the priests take care to 
  encourage the delusion; and not a day passes without an application for a 
  cure. There are numerous images at Rome believed to possess the power of 
  working miracles. Among the rest is that of Mary in S. Maria Maggiore. This 
  picture was carried in procession through the streets of Rome to suppress the 
  cholera, the Pope (Gregory XVI.) joining barefooted in the procession.<a 
  HREF="#[6]"><sup>6</sup></a><a NAME="6"></a></a> And what, we may ask, is the 
  change which the Papist believes passes upon the image in the act of 
  consecration? Is it not this, that where as before it was simply a piece of 
  dead and inefficacious matter, it has now become filled or inspired with the 
  virtue or divinity of the object it represents, who is now mysteriously 
  present in it or with it? </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, in the third place, though this distinction were 
  one that could be easily drawn, and though it could be shown that it always is 
  clearly drawn by the worshipper, and though it could be shown also, that all 
  the good effects which have been alleged do in point of fact flow from this 
  practice, all this would make nothing as a defence. The Word of God denounces 
  the practice as idolatrous, and plainly forbids it. The condemnation and 
  prohibition of this practice form the subject of one entire precept of the 
  Decalogue. &quot;Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
  anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, &amp;c.; thou 
  shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am 
  a jealous God.&quot;<a HREF="#[7]"><sup>7</sup></a><a NAME="7"></a></a>
  <img border="0" src="commandments.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" 
  width="148" height="158">Till these words are revoked as plainly and solemnly 
  as they were promulgated,—till the same mighty voice shall proclaim in the 
  hearing of the nations that the second precept of the Decalogue has been 
  abrogated,—the practice of Rome must stand condemned as idolatrous. The case, 
  then, is a plain one, and resolves itself into this, Whether shall we obey 
  Rome or Jehovah? The former, speaking from the Seven Hills, says, &quot;Thou mayest 
  make unto thee graven images, and bow down thyself to them, and serve them:&quot; 
  the latter, speaking in thunder from Sinai, says, &quot;Thou shalt not make unto 
  thee any graven image…thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them and serve 
  them.&quot; Rome herself has confessed that these two commands,—that from the Seven 
  Hills and that from Sinai,—are eternally irreconcilable, by blotting from the 
  Decalogue the second precept of the law.<a HREF="#[8]"><sup>8</sup></a><a 
  NAME="8"></a></a> Alas! Will this avail her aught so long as that precept 
  stands unrepealed in the law of God? May God have mercy upon her poor 
  benighted people, whom she leads blindfold into idolatry; and may He remember 
  this extenuation of their guilt when he arises to execute judgment upon those 
  who, knowing that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only do 
  them, but teach others to do the same! </p>
