  [pg. 1]<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many disasters are now taking place. These are 
  admonitions to us that we are living in the last days. Daily we read of 
  earthquakes; of the going down of many ships, with great loss of life; of 
  destructive floods; and of the burning of immense buildings costing millions 
  of dollars--buildings which men have pronounced fireproof, but which, when 
  touched by the finger of God, are consumed. With a loud voice these things 
  speak to us, saying, &quot;The end of all things is at hand.&quot;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are living in the closing period of this earth's history. 
  What shall we do to awaken the people to a realization of their dangerous 
  condition? Already the plagues of God are coming upon the world; yet many of 
  those who for years have been expecting to behold Christ at His second 
  appearing, are assuming an attitude of listless indifference to the daily 
  events which show that His coming is drawing near.</p>

  <p align="center"><b>Securing Our Inheritance</b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in 
  like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange 
  flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. 
  Jude 7.</b><br>
  <br>
  The outlook in our world is indeed alarming. God is withdrawing His Spirit 
  from the wicked cities, which have become as the cities of the antediluvian 
  world, and as Sodom and Gomorrah. The inhabitants of these cities have been 
  tested and tried. We have reached a time when God is about to punish the 
  presumptuous wrongdoers, who refuse to keep His commandments and disregard His 
  messages of warning. He who bears long with evildoers gives everyone an 
  opportunity to seek Him and humble their hearts before Him.</p>
  <p align="left">Everyone has opportunity to come to Christ and be converted, 
  that He may heal them. But there will come a time when mercy will be no longer 
  offered. Costly mansions, marvels of architectural skill, will be destroyed 
  without a moment's notice, when the Lord sees that the owners have passed the 
  boundaries of forgiveness. The destruction by fire of the stately buildings 
  supposed to be fireproof is an illustration of how in a short time earth's 
  architecture will lie in ruins.</p>
  <p align="left">The twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew gives an outline of what 
  is to come upon the world. We are living amid the perils of the last days. 
  Those who are perishing in sin must be warned. The Lord calls upon every one 
  to whom He has entrusted the talent of means to act as His helping hand by 
  giving their money for the advancement of His work. Our money is a treasure 
  lent us by the Lord, and it is to be invested in the work of giving to the 
  world the last message of mercy.</p>
  <p align="left">He who looks at earthly things as the chief good, he who 
  spends his life in an effort to gain worldly riches, is indeed making a poor 
  investment. Too late he will see that in which he has trusted crumbling into 
  dust. It is only through self-denial, through the sacrifice of earthly riches, 
  that the eternal riches can be obtained. It is through much tribulation that 
  the Christian enters the kingdom of heaven. Constantly he is to war the good 
  warfare, not laying down his weapons until Christ bids him rest. Only by 
  giving all to Christ can he secure the inheritance that will endure through 
  all eternity. -- Letter 90, May 23, 1902, to Brother Johnson, a layman.<br>

  </b></u>[pg. 411]<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Now comes the word that I have declared that New York is to be swept away by 
  a tidal wave. This I have never said. I have said, as I looked at the great 
  buildings going up there, story after story:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>[pg. 412]<br>
  <br>
  'What terrible scenes will take place when the Lord shall arise to shake 
  terribly the earth! Then the words of Rev. 18:1-3 will be fulfilled.'&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[Rev 18:1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from 
    heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.<br>
    Rev 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the 
    great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the 
    hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.<br>
    Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
    fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, 
    and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
    delicacies.]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The whole of the eighteenth chapter of Revelation is a warning of what is 
  coming on the earth. But I have no light in particular in regard to what is 
  coming on New York, only I know that one day the great buildings there will be 
  thrown down by the turning and overturning of God's power. From the light 
  given me, I know that destruction is in the world. One word from the Lord, one 
  touch of His mighty power, and these massive structures will fall. Scenes will 
  take place the fearfulness of which we cannot imagine.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b><u><font size="4"><a name="3"></a>Testimonies to the Church, Volume 8, 
  written in 1904.</font></u></b></p>
  <p>[pg. 31]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's encouraging message of mercy should be proclaimed 
  in the cities of America. Men and women living in these cities are rapidly 
  becoming more and still more entangled in their business relations. They are 
  acting wildly in the erection of buildings whose towers reach high into the 
  heavens. Their minds are filled with schemes and ambitious devisings. God is 
  bidding every one of His ministering servants: Cry aloud, spare not, lift up 
  thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the 
  house of Jacob their sins.&quot; Isaiah 58:1.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>[pg. 32]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us thank the Lord that there are a few laborers 
  doing everything possible to raise up some memorials for God in our neglected 
  cities. Let us remember that it is our duty to give these workers 
  encouragement. God is displeased with the lack of appreciation and support 
  shown our faithful workers in our large cities by His people in our own land. 
  The work in the home field is a vital problem just now. The present time is 
  the most favorable opportunity that we shall have to work these fields. In a 
  little while the situation will be much more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus wept over Jerusalem because of the guilt and 
  obstinacy of His chosen people. He weeps also over the hardheartedness of 
  those who, professing to be co-workers with Him, are content to do nothing. 
  Are those who should appreciate the value of souls carrying, with Christ, a 
  burden of heaviness and constant sorrow, mingled with tears, for the cities of 
  the earth? The destruction of these cities, almost wholly given up to 
  idolatry, is impending. In the great day of final reckoning what answer can be 
  given for neglecting to enter these cities now?&nbsp;</p>
  <p>[pg. 252]<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I hear of the terrible calamities that from week to week 
  are taking place, I ask myself: What do these things mean? The most awful 
  disasters are following one another in quick succession. How frequently we 
  hear of earthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by fire and flood, with 
  great loss of life and property! Apparently these calamities are capricious 
  outbreaks of seemingly disorganized, unregulated forces, but in them God's 
  purpose may be read. They are one of the means by which He seeks to arouse men 
  and women to a sense of their danger.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coming of Christ is nearer than when we first believed. 
  The great controversy is nearing its end. The judgments of God are in the 
  land. They speak in solemn warning, saying:&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man 
    cometh.&quot; Matthew 24:44.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But there are many, many in our churches who know little of the real 
  meaning of the truth for this time. I appeal to them not to disregard the 
  fulfilling of the signs of the times, which says so plainly that the end is 
  near. Oh, how many who have not sought their souls' salvation will soon make 
  the bitter lamentation: &quot;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are 
  not saved&quot;!&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are living in the closing scenes of this earth's history. 
  Prophecy is fast fulfilling. The hours of probation are fast passing. We have 
  no time--not a moment--to lose. Let us not be found sleeping on guard. Let no 
  one say in his heart or by his works: &quot;My Lord delayeth His coming.&quot; Let the 
  message of Christ's soon return sound forth in earnest words of warning. Let 
  us persuade men and women everywhere to repent and flee from the wrath to 
  come. Let us arouse them to immediate preparation, for we little know what is 
  before us. Let ministers and lay members go forth into the ripening fields to 
  tell the unconcerned and indifferent to seek the Lord while He may be found. 
  The workers will find their harvest wherever they proclaim the forgotten 
  truths of the Bible. They will find those who will accept the truth and will 
  devote their lives to winning souls to Christ.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  [pg. 253]<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord is soon to come, and we must be prepared to meet Him 
  in peace. Let us be determined to do all in our power to impart light to those 
  around us. We are not to be sad, but cheerful, and we are to keep the Lord 
  Jesus ever before us. He is soon coming, and we must be ready and waiting for 
  His appearing. Oh, how glorious it will be to see Him and be welcomed as His 
  redeemed ones! Long have we waited, but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can 
  but see the King in His beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I 
  must cry aloud: &quot;Homeward bound!&quot; We are nearing the time when Christ will 
  come in power and great glory to take His ransomed ones to their eternal home.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am bidden to declare the message that cities 
  full of transgression, and sinful in the extreme, will be destroyed by 
  earthquakes, by fire, by</p>
  <p>[pg. 91]</p>
  <p>flood. All the world will be warned that there is a God who will display 
  His authority as God. His unseen agencies will cause destruction, devastation, 
  and death. All the accumulated riches will be as nothingness.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the scientific care with which men safeguard 
  buildings from destruction, one touch of the great and rightful Ruler will 
  bring to nothingness the idolatrous possessions that have been laid up in a 
  sightly and magnificent display. The devices of men will come to naught. ...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bible history is to be repeated. Calamities will 
  come--calamities most awful, most unexpected; and these destructions will 
  follow one after another. If there will be a heeding of the warnings that God 
  has given, and if churches will repent, returning to their allegiance, then 
  other cities may be spared for a time. But if men who have been deceived 
  continue in the same way in which they have been walking, disregarding the law 
  of God, and presenting falsehoods before the people, God allows them to suffer 
  calamity,</p>

  </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the night I was, I thought, in a room 
  but not in my own house. I was in a city, where I knew not, and I heard 
  expression after expression. I rose up quickly in bed, and saw from my window 
  large balls of fire. Jetting out were sparks, in the form of arrows, and 
  buildings were being consumed, and in a very few minutes the entire block of 
  buildings was falling and the screeching and mournful groans came distinctly 
  to my ears. I cried out, in my raised position, to learn what was happening: 
  Where am I? And where are our family circle? Then I awoke. But I could not 
  tell where I was for I was in another place than home. I said, Oh Lord, where 
  am I and what shall I do? It was a voice that spoke, &quot;Be not afraid. Nothing 
  shall harm you.&quot; </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was instructed that destruction hath gone forth upon 
  cities. The word of the Lord will be fulfilled. Isaiah 29:19-24 was repeated. 
  I dared not move, not knowing where I was. I cried unto the Lord, What does it 
  mean? These representations of destruction were repeated. Where am I? &quot;In 
  scenes I have represented that which will be; but warn My people to cease from 
  putting their trust in men who are not obedient to my warnings and who despise 
  My reproof, for the day of the Lord is right upon the world when evidence 
  shall be made sure. Those who have followed the voices that would turn things 
  upside down will themselves be turned where they cannot see, but will be as 
  blind men. </p>
  <p>[pg. 362] </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words were given me from Isaiah 30: &quot;Now go, write 
  it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time 
  to come for ever and ever: That this is a rebellious people, lying children, 
  children that will not hear the law of the Lord: Which say to the seers, See 
  not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us 
  smooth things, prophesy deceits.&quot; [Isaiah 30:8-15 quoted.] </p>

  <p>[pg.12] </p>
  <p><b>[Corporate Greed, Fraud and Deceit, Costly Tall buildings in New York 
  Destroyed]<br>
  </b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, when in New York City, I was in the night 
  season called upon to behold buildings rising story after story toward heaven. 
  These buildings were warranted to be fireproof, and they were erected to 
  glorify the owners and builders. Higher and still higher these buildings rose, 
  and in them the most costly material was used. Those to whom these buildings 
  belonged were not asking themselves: &quot;How can we best glorify God?&quot; The Lord 
  was not in their thoughts.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought: &quot;Oh, that those who are thus investing their means 
  could see their course as God sees it! They are piling up magnificent 
  buildings, but how foolish in the sight of the Ruler of the universe is their 
  planning and devising. They are not studying with all the powers of heart and 
  mind how they may glorify God. They have lost sight of this, the first duty of 
  man.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As these lofty buildings went up, the owners rejoiced with 
  ambitious pride that they had money to use in gratifying self and provoking 
  the envy of their neighbors. Much of the money that they thus invested had 
  been obtained through exaction, through grinding down the poor. They forgot 
  that in heaven an account of every business transaction is kept; every unjust 
  deal, every fraudulent act, is there recorded. The time is coming when in 
  their fraud and insolence men will reach a point that the Lord will not permit 
  them to pass, and they will learn that there is a limit to the forbearance of 
  Jehovah.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  [pg. 13]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene that next passed before me was an alarm of 
  fire. Men looked at the lofty and supposedly fire-proof buildings and said: 
  &quot;They are perfectly safe.&quot; But these buildings were consumed as if made of 
  pitch. The fire engines could do nothing to stay the destruction. The firemen 
  were unable to operate the engines.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am instructed that when the Lord's time comes, should no 
  change have taken place in the hearts of proud, ambitious human beings, men 
  will find that the hand that had been strong to save will be strong to 
  destroy. No earthly power can stay the hand of God. No material can be used in 
  the erection of buildings that will preserve them from destruction when God's 
  appointed time comes to send retribution on men for their disregard of His law 
  and for their selfish ambition.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are not many, even among educators and statesmen, who 
  comprehend the causes that underlie the present state of society. Those who 
  hold the reins of government are not able to solve the problem of moral 
  corruption, poverty, pauperism, and increasing crime. <a name="4a"></a>They 
  are struggling in vain to place business operations on a more secure basis. If 
  men would give more heed to the teaching of God's word, they would find a 
  solution of the problems that perplex them.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Scriptures describe the condition of the world just 
  before Christ's second coming. Of the men who by robbery and extortion are 
  amassing great riches, it is written:&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of 
    the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by 
    fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the 
    ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and 
    been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye 
    have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.&quot; James 
    5:3-6.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>[pg. 14]</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But who reads the warnings given by the fast-fulfilling 
  signs of the times? What impression is made upon worldlings? What change is 
  seen in their attitude? No more than was seen in the attitude of the 
  inhabitants of the Noachian world. Absorbed in worldly business and pleasure, 
  the antediluvians&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;knew not until the Flood came, and took them all away.&quot; Matthew 24:39.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They had heaven-sent warnings, but they refused to listen. And today the 
  world, utterly regardless of the warning voice of God, is hurrying on to 
  eternal ruin.&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><a name="5"></a>[World stirred with the

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is stirred with the spirit of war. The 
  prophecy of the eleventh chapter of Daniel has nearly reached its complete 
  fulfillment. Soon the scenes of trouble spoken of in the prophecies will take 
  place.&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and 
    turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. . . . 
    Because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the 
    everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they 
    that dwell therein are desolate. . . . The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the 
    noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.&quot; Isaiah 
    24:1-8.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>[pg. 15]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Alas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a 
    destruction from the Almighty shall it come. . . . The seed is rotten under 
    their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down, for 
    the corn is withered. How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are 
    perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made 
    desolate.&quot; &quot;The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the 
    pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees 
    of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of 
    men.&quot; Joel 1:15-18, 12.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I am pained at my very heart; . . . I cannot hold my peace, because thou 
    has heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
    Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled.&quot; 
    Jeremiah 4:19, 20.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the 
    heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they 
    trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no 
    man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the 
    fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken 
    down.&quot; Verses 23-26.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time 
    of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.&quot; Jeremiah 30:7.&nbsp;
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all in this world have taken sides with the enemy 
  against God. Not all have become disloyal. There are a faithful few who are 
  true to God; for John writes:&nbsp; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of 
    Jesus.&quot; Revelation 14:12.&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the battle will be waged fiercely between those who 
  serve God and those who serve Him not. Soon everything that can be shaken will 
  be shaken,<br>
  <br>
  [pg. 16]<br>
  <br>
  that those things that cannot be shaken may remain.&nbsp; </p>

  in Exodus 31:12-18.&nbsp; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[Exo 31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
    Exo 31:13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my 
    sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your 
    generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.<br>
    Exo 31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: 
    every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth 
    any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.<br>
    Exo 31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of 
    rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he 
    shall surely be put to death.<br>
    Exo 31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to 
    observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.<br>
    Exo 31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for 
    in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he 
    rested, and was refreshed.<br>
    Exo 31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with 
    him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with 
    the finger of God.] </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are to take their stand on the living word: &quot;It is 
  written.&quot; This is the only foundation upon which they can stand securely. 
  Those who have broken their covenant with God will in that day be without God 
  and without hope.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by 
  their regard for the fourth commandment, since this is the sign of God's 
  creative power and the witness to His claim upon man's reverence and homage. 
  The wicked will be distinguished by their efforts to tear down the Creator's 
  memorial and to exalt the institution of Rome. In the issue of the conflict 
  all Christendom will be divided into two great classes, those who keep the 
  commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast 
  and his image, and receive his mark. Although church and state will unite 
  their power to compel all,&nbsp; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,&quot; to receive the mark 
    of the beast, yet the people of God will not receive it. Revelation 13:16.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prophet of Patmos beholds&nbsp; </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and 
    over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, 
    having the harps of God,&quot; and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. 
    Revelation 15:2. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>[pg. 17]<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fearful tests and trials await the people of God. The spirit 
  of war is stirring the nations from one end of the earth to the other. But in 
  the midst of the time of trouble that is coming,--a time of trouble such as 
  has not been since there was a nation,--God's chosen people will stand 
  unmoved. Satan and his host cannot destroy them, for angels that excel in 
  strength will protect them. God's word to His people is: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;Come out from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and 
    touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father 
    unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters.&quot; &quot;Ye are a chosen 
    generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye 
    should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness 
    into His marvelous light.&quot; 2 Corinthians 6: 17, 18; 1 Peter 2:9. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's people are to be distinguished as a 
  people who serve Him fully, wholeheartedly, taking no honor to themselves, and 
  remembering that by a most solemn covenant they have bound themselves to serve 
  the Lord and Him only. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;The Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the 
    children of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a 
    sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I 
    am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for 
    it is holy unto you: everyone that defileth it shall surely be put to death: 
    for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among 
    his people. Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the Sabbath of 
    rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he 
    shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep 
    the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a 
    perpetual covenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel 
    forever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh 
    day He rested, and was refreshed.&quot; Exodus 31:12-17. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>[pg. 18]<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not these words point us out as God's denominated people? 
  and do they not declare to us that so long as time shall last, we are to 
  cherish the sacred, denominational distinction placed upon us? The children of 
  Israel were to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations &quot;for a 
  perpetual covenant.&quot; The Sabbath has lost none of its meaning. It is still the 
  sign between God and His people, and it will be so forever. </p>
  <p><b><u><font size="4"><a name="8"></a>Even at the Door, <i>Southern Watchman</i>, 
  December 1st, 1909<br>
  </font><br>
  </u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The signs in the sun, moon, and stars have been 
  fulfilled. Since that time earthquakes, tempests, tidal waves, pestilence, and 
  famines have multiplied. The most awful destructions, by fire and flood, are 
  following one another in quick succession. The terrible disasters that are 
  taking place from week to week speak to us in earnest tones of warning, 
  declaring that the end is near, that something great and decisive will soon of 
  necessity take place.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confusion fills the world, and a great terror is soon to come 
  upon human beings. The end is very near. We who know the truth should be 
  preparing for what is soon to break upon the world as an overwhelming 
  surprise.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probationary time will not continue much longer. Now God is 
  withdrawing his restraining hand from the earth. Long has he been speaking to 
  men and women through the agency of his Holy Spirit; but they have not heeded 
  the call. Now he is speaking to his people, and to the world, by his 
  judgments. The time of these judgments is a time of mercy for those who have 
  not yet had opportunity to learn what is truth. Tenderly will the Lord look 
  upon them. His heart of mercy is touched; his hand is still stretched out to 
  save. </p>
  <p align="left"><b><a name="9"></a><font size="4"><u>Supplement to the 
  Christian Experience<br>
  and Views of Ellen G. White, written in 1854.</u></font></b> </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 3]&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Dear Christian Friends:--As I have given a brief sketch of my experience 
  and views, published in 1851, it seems to be my duty to notice some points in 
  that little work; also, to give more recent views. </p>
  <p>1. On page 17, is as follows:--&quot;I saw that the Holy Sabbath is, and will 
  be, the separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers; and 
  that the Sabbath is the great question, to unite the hearts of God's dear, 
  waiting saints. I saw that God had children, who do not see and keep the 
  Sabbath. They had not rejected the light on it. And at the commencement of the 
  time of trouble, we were filled with the Holy Ghost as we went forth and 
  proclaimed the Sabbath more fully.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>This view was given in 1847, when there were but very few of the Advent 
  brethren observing the Sabbath, and of these, but few supposed that its 
  observance was of sufficient importance to draw a line between the people of 
  God and unbelievers. Now, the fulfillment of that view is beginning to be 
  seen. </p>
  <p>&quot;The commencement of the time of trouble,&quot; here mentioned, does not refer 
  to the time when the plagues shall begin to be poured out; but to a short 
  period just before they are poured out, while Christ is in the Sanctuary. At 
  that time, while the work of salvation is closing, trouble will be coming on 
  the earth, the nations will be angry, yet held in check, so as not to prevent 
  the work of the third angel. At that time the &quot;latter rain,&quot; or refreshing 
  from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of 
  the third angel, and prepare the saints to stand in the period when the seven 
  last plagues shall be poured out. </p>
