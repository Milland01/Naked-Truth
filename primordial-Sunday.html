    <p>But Sunday IS an externally imposed duty not commanded by God! It is a 
    duty imposed by the Catholic Church, a Tradition of men which cannot be 
    found in the Bible. Sunday sacredness is simply <i>not</i> a precept of God, 
    it is a precept of men.</p>

    <p>73. ... To lose a sense of Sunday as the Lord's Day, a day to be 
    sanctified, is symptomatic of the loss of an authentic sense of Christian 
    freedom, the freedom of the children of God. (206) Here some observations 
    made by my venerable predecessor John Paul II in his Apostolic Letter <i>
    <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_05071998_dies-domini_en.html">
    Dies Domini</a></i> (207) continue to have great value. Speaking of the 
    various dimensions of the Christian celebration of Sunday, he said that it 
    is<i> Dies Domini</i> with regard to the work of creation,<i> Dies Christi</i> 
    as the day of the new creation and the Risen Lord's gift of the Holy Spirit,
    <i>Dies Ecclesiae</i> as the day on which the Christian community gathers 
    for the celebration, and<i> Dies hominis</i> as the day of joy, rest and 
    fraternal charity.</p>
    <p align="left">Sunday thus appears as the primordial holy day, when all 
    believers, wherever they are found, can become heralds and guardians of the 
    true meaning of time. ...</p>
    <p align="left">74. Finally, it is particularly urgent nowadays to remember 
    that the day of the Lord is also a day of rest from work. It is greatly to 
    be hoped that this fact will also be recognized by civil society, so that 
    individuals can be permitted to refrain from work without being penalized. 
    Christians, not without reference to the meaning of the Sabbath in the 
    Jewish tradition, have seen in the Lord's Day a day of rest from their daily 
    exertions.<font face="Times New Roman"> — Pope Benedict XVI,

    <p>Pope Benedict XVI implies that Sunday, the 
  first day of the week, (traditionally called Dies Domini, the Lord's day) is the sanctified holy day, &quot;with regard to the work of 
  creation.&quot; This directly contradicts scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and 
    he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
    Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in 
    it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
    that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the 
    sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>The seventh day sabbath is 
  <i>the</i> primordial (original) holy day, blessed and sanctified by God at 
    the end of creation week, not Sunday the first day! To be &quot;heralds and 
    guardians of the true meaning of time&quot; one would have to keep holy the 
    seventh day sabbath (Isa. 58:12-14), Saturday, established at creation, and directed 
  by God in His Ten Commandments!</p>

  <p align="left">Pope Benedict XVI is referring back to the following by Pope John 
  Paul II:</p>
  <blockquote>

  <p>God's biblical rest day is the seventh day of the week, Saturday. It is not 
  the first day of the week, Sunday. Scripture never designates the first day of the week as the Lord's day, 
  however, God calls the sabbath &quot;my holy day&quot; (Isa. 58:13) and refers to 
  Himself as Lord &quot;of the sabbath day&quot; (Matt.12:8, Mk 2:28, Lk 6:5). </p>
