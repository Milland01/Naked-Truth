<blockquote>
  <p>In discussing with Catholics the practice of bowing and praying before 
  statues or icons (pictures), almost without fail you will be presented with 
  something like the following rationalizations:</p>
  <p>God told Israel to make statues of cherubim (angels) and put them in the 
  temple of God, so statues are allowed. Therefore, bowing down in front of 
  statues must be permissible in certain circumstances, like when you pray to 
  whom the statue represents, but not to the statue itself. Since that is what 
  Catholics do, it is O.K. with God.</p>
  <p>God also told Moses to make a serpent of brass for Israel. Clearly God 
  encourages his people to make statues and images as an aid in worship, right?</p>
  <p>You probably even have pictures of relatives in your wallet or purse, or on 
  the dresser at home, so why can't Catholics have pictures or statues of Mary, 
  Jesus, or Saints? We Catholics don't pray to the statues or icons, they just 
  represent who we are praying to, just like your photos remind you of your 
  relatives. If we Catholics are guilty of idolatry, then so is everyone with 
  pictures of their parents etc. </p>
  <p>An example of this type of Catholic rational is available from Catholic 
  apologist Patrick Madrid's blog:&nbsp; <b>
  
        <a href="http://patrickmadrid.blogspot.com/2010/06/did-you-hear-one-about-how-catholics.html">
        Did you hear the one about how Catholics &quot;worship&quot; statues?</a></b> </p>
  
  <p>So, let's look at each of these in turn to see if there is any validity in 
  the Catholic claim. </p>
  
  <center>
  <p><strong><font size="+1">The Golden Cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant</font></strong></p>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, ...</p>
    <p>Exo 25:18 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt 
    thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.<br>
    Exo 25:19 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the 
    other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two 
    ends thereof.<br>
    Exo 25:20 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, 
    covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to 
    another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.<br>
    Exo 25:21 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the 
    ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.<br>
    Exo 25:22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from 
    above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark 
    of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto 
    the children of Israel. </p>
    <p>Exo 25:40 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was 
    showed thee in the mount. </p>
    <center>
    <p><img src="ark2.gif" alt=" Ark of the Covenant " width="309" height="138"></p>
    </center>
    <p>Exo 37:7 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made 
    he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;<br>
    Exo 37:8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other 
    end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two 
    ends thereof.<br>
    Exo 37:9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with 
    their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to 
    the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If you study the matter, you will find that these golden cherubim on the 
  Ark were normally located in what was called the holy of holies, the innermost 
  apartment of the Hebrew Sanctuary. Because they covered the lid of the Ark, 
  known as the mercy seat, these were known as &quot;covering cherubim&quot;. Only the 
  Jewish high priest was ever allowed to enter this room, and then only on one 
  day of each year, the Day of Atonement. Search the scriptures and you will 
  find that the high priest was never instructed to bow down to these statues of 
  cherubim or to pray to the angels in heaven that they represented.</p>
  <p>Cherubim were also woven into the tapestries of the traveling Sanctuary of 
  Moses: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 26:1 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of 
    fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of 
    cunning work shalt thou make them.</p>
    <p>Exo 26:31 And thou shalt make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, 
    and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made: </p>
    <p>Exo 36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of 
    the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, 
    and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. </p>
    <p>Exo 36:35 And he made a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine 
    twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again, these images of cherubim in the tapestries were never bowed down to, 
  and prayer to angels was not permitted and never occurred before them. Angel 
  worship is prohibited. When John the Revelator bowed down to worship an angel, 
  the angel quickly stopped him from doing so:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:8 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had 
    heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which 
    showed me these things.<br>
    Rev 22:9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy 
    fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the 
    sayings of this book: worship God. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, none of the images of angels in the Sanctuary involved angel worship. 
  God's permitting these images does <em>not</em> mean that God sanctions bowing 
  before and praying in front of images.</p>

  <p><strong><font size="+1">The Cherubim and Images of Solomon's Temple</font></strong></p>
  </center>
  <p>In the traveling Sanctuary of Moses' day, everything that was a part of the 
  temple had to be portable so that it could be easily carried as Israel moved 
  through the wilderness. When Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem, he could 
  build things larger and more elaborate than was previously possible. The small 
  cherubim on the Ark were overshadowed by much larger ones that Solomon had 
  made: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Ki 6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he 
    made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it 
    with gold.<br>
    1 Ki 6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished 
    all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with 
    gold.<br>
    1 Ki 6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each 
    ten cubits high.<br>
    1 Ki 6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits 
    the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto 
    the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.<br>
    1 Ki 6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of 
    one measure and one size.<br>
    1 Ki 6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the 
    other cherub.<br>
    1 Ki 6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they 
    stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one 
    touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other 
    wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.<br>
    1 Ki 6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.<br>
    1 Ki 6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved 
    figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</p>
    <p>1 Chr 28:18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold 
    for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their 
    wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.<br>
    1 Chr 28:19 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by 
    his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Solomon's Temple Doors</strong> </p>
  <p>Solomon's Temple doors also had elaborate illustrations of cherubims, palm 
  trees and blooming flowers: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Ki 6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them 
    carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them 
    with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p>
    <p>1 Ki 6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open 
    flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Solomon's Molten Sea</strong> </p>
  <p>Solomon's temple had a gigantic water reservoir or laver, called a molten 
  sea, for the priests to wash themselves, and it also had sculptures of oxen at 
  its base: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><img src="s-laver.jpg" width="200" height="160" align="LEFT" 
    alt=" Molten Sea of Solomon's Temple "> 1 Ki 7:23 And he made a molten sea, 
    ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his 
    height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round 
    about.<br>
    1 Ki 7:24 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing 
    it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in 
    two rows, when it was cast.<br>
    1 Ki 7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and 
    three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three 
    looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their 
    hinder parts were inward.<br>
    1 Ki 7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought 
    like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand 
    baths.</p>
    <p>2 Chr 4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, 
    round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty 
    cubits did compass it round about.<br>
    2 Chr 4:3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it 
    round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of 
    oxen were cast, when it was cast.<br>
    2 Chr 4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and 
    three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three 
    looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their 
    hinder parts were inward.<br>
    2 Chr 4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it 
    like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received 
    and held three thousand baths. </p>
    <p>2 Chr 4:15 One sea, and twelve oxen under it. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Solomon's Laver Bases</strong> </p>
  <p>And there were ten basins of water for rinsing items associated with burnt 
  sacrifices that sat on bases of brass that were richly decorated with images:</p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="w-laver.jpg" width="180" height="190" align="left" 
      alt=" Bronze Laver and Wheeled Base from Solomon's Temple "> </td>
      <td>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1 Ki 7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length 
        of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the 
        height of it.<br>
        1 Ki 7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had 
        borders, and the borders were between the ledges:<br>
        1 Ki 7:29 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, 
        oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and 
        beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work. </p>
      </blockquote>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Chr 4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Solomon's Temple had many carvings, images, and even statues of angels 
  and oxen, but in no case did anyone bow down before them and pray to what they 
  represented. Many churches use similar such decorations of angels etc., and 
  they do not go against the Commandments of God. You cross the line though when 
  you bow down before any image in prayer. That act of bowing down before any 
  image in worship is what God so clearly forbids.</p>
  <hr width="70%" align="center" size="2">
  <center>
  <p><strong><font size="+1">The Brass Serpent of Moses</font></strong></p>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Num 21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set 
    it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, 
    when he looketh upon it, shall live.<br>
    Num 21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it 
    came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the 
    serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
    <p>John 3:14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so 
    must the Son of man be lifted up:<br>
    John 3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have 
    eternal life. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that no one was told to bow down to the brass serpent, and neither was 
  anyone instructed to pray before it, even though the serpent on the pole 
  represented Jesus Christ who though innocent would become sin, and be 
  crucified for all of mankind. Looking upon the serpent brought life to those 
  dying, just as faith in Jesus Christ will bring life to all who will believe 
  and have faith. </p>
  <p>Now, notice what happened when years later, the exact same serpent of brass 
  is again mentioned in scripture: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Ki 18:3 And he [King Hezekiah] did that which was right in the sight of 
    the LORD, according to all that David his father did.<br>
    2 Ki 18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the 
    groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for unto 
    those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it 
    Nehushtan.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So what prompted the King to destroy the brass serpent? Because the people 
  had begun worshipping it as an idol, burning incense (which represents prayer 
  to God - Psa. 141:2, Luke 1:11, Rev. 8:3-4) before it. So 
  Hezekiah did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and destroyed it.</p>
  <hr width="70%" align="center" size="2">
  <center>
  <p><strong><font size="+1">Golden Tumors and Golden Rats</font></strong></p>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 6:5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of 
    your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: 
    peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, 
    and from off your land.</p>
    <p>1 Sam 6:8 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put 
    the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a coffer 
    by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This incident will take a little explaining. Briefly, Israel had been in 
  captivity to the Philistines for 40 years because of apostasy <nobr>(Judges 
  13:1), </nobr>and without the counsel of God they brought the Ark of the 
  Covenant to the battlefield (1 Sam 4:1-5) to secure their victory. Since that 
  did not have the guidance of God to do so, Israel suffered a great defeat and 
  lost the Ark of God to the Philistines <nobr>(1 Sam 4:10-11). </nobr>The 
  Philistines took the Ark and placed it as an offering next to their god Dagon 
  (1 Sam 5:1). The statue of Dagon was found the next morning fallen prostrate 
  before the Ark (1 Sam 5:3). They set him back up, and the next morning not 
  only had Dagon fallen again, but his head and hands had been severed <nobr>(1 
  Sam 5:4) </nobr>leaving nothing but a stump of stone. The Philistines were 
  also smitten by God with a plague of cancerous tumors (emerods in the King 
  James - 1 Sam 5:6) and a plague of mice. Wanting to rid themselves of these 
  plagues and the Ark of God, the Philistines consulted their priests and 
  diviners <nobr>(1 Sam 6:2). </nobr>The answer in part was to make 
  representations of tumors and mice out of gold (symbolic of the plagues) and 
  place them in a box as a trespass offering next to Ark and send them to the 
  Israelites <nobr>(1 Sam 6: 3-11) </nobr>on a cart. By doing this, the plagues 
  would be lifted from the Philistines. </p>
  <p>The tumors and mice fashioned from gold were never bowed down to, and never 
  used as aid to prayer. They were simply proof to the Philistines that the God 
  of Israel was the true God, and that by returning what was not theirs (the 
  Ark) God would remove the plagues that He had imposed on them. It had been 
  made clear to the Philistines that their god Dagon was powerless before the 
  God of Israel and the addition of the plagues should have convinced them that 
  their idolatry was useless and powerless, and a parallel is drawn with their 
  situation and that of Pharaoh of Egypt (1 Sam 6:6). </p>
  <p>Even after the Ark was returned to Israel, it remained in Kirjathjearim for 
  twenty years, rather than at Shiloh, where it had previously been for 300 
  years, because of Israel's ongoing apostasy. Apparently for the twenty years 
  it was at Kirjathjearim none of the great festival celebrations were properly 
  observed. Samuel warned that Israel's bondage to the Philistines would end 
  only when Israel repented of their idolatry (1 Sam 7:3). </p>
  <p>So, now, on what basis can anyone point to the golden tumors and golden 
  mice to justify bowing down and praying before statues and images? The whole 
  theme of this part of scripture is to show idolatry for what it is, apostasy. 
  Only someone totally unfamiliar with scripture would point to this section to 
  justify bowing down and praying before statues.</p>
  <hr width="70%" align="center" size="2">
  <center>
  <p><strong><font size="+1">Pictures of Your Mother</font></strong></p>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>
    Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
    any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that 
    is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
    LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
    children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, by having pictures of relatives, are you breaking the Commandments of 
  God against graven images? Well, first, let me ask you, do you bow down before 
  these pictures and pray to your relatives (living or dead)? If you do, then 
  you are indeed breaking God's law. How about statues of famous men, like 
  George Washington, etc., aren't they idolatry? No, not unless you bow down 
  before them and pray to the person they represent. But, then you might ask, 
  what of bowing down before a king or person of authority as a sign of respect, 
  surely this must be idolatry too? There are many examples of people bowing to 
  each other in the Bible, but nowhere is this practice of respect forbidden. 
  Here is just one instance of this practice:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that 
    sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed 
    down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So was this idolatry? No, it was a sign of respect for the office and 
  authority of Joseph, and his brothers were acknowledging his authority over 
  them and their willingness to serve him. The only exception to this may be 
  when a King or Ruler demands to be worshipped as a god, then bowing down to 
  him would be idolatry. However, this is exactly why bowing down to statues and 
  images is forbidden, because by bowing down you are indicating that your are 
  the servant of that image, and that is specifically forbidden:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I 
    the LORD thy God am a jealous God, ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="70%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>So did God permit certain images and statues? No question about it, he did 
  indeed. However: </p>
  <p>The golden cherubim and other images of the Hebrew Sanctuary were not used 
  to bow down before and were never the focus of any prayer.</p>
  <p>Moses did not have the people bow down before the brass serpent, they only 
  needed to look at it. But many years later, when the people began to 
  apostatize, using the brass serpent as an idol by burning incense before it, 
  God had King Hezekiah destroy it. </p>
  <p>The golden tumors and golden mice offered by the Philistines as a trespass 
  offering with the Ark were symbolic of the plagues God had brought on them and 
  were never used by Israel as a part of worship or prayer. </p>
  <p>And finally, pictures and statues are only an idol when you bow down and 
  pray before them in the process of worship, so pictures of relatives and 
  statues of famous men etc. are not contrary to the law of God. </p>
  <p>So none of the passages in scripture that we have looked at in any way 
  justify the Catholic practice of bowing down in front of icons or statues, 
  which God forbids as idolatry in very clear terms: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.<br>
    Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
    any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that 
    is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 <strong>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them:</strong> 
    for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the 
    fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that 
    hate me;</p>
    <p>Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up 
    a standing image, <b>neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your 
    land, to bow down unto it:</b> for I am the LORD your God.</p>
    <p>Judg 2:17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but <b>they 
    went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them</b>: they 
    turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the 
    commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God has not completely prohibited art in all it's forms, or all images, as 
  the Sanctuary of Moses and the Temple of Solomon demonstrate, but God has <em>
  <strong>never</strong></em> permitted anyone to bow down in prayer before any 
  image or statue of Himself for any reason at all. Furthermore, God has clearly 
  prohibited bowing down before any image of any kind at all <i>when the image 
  represents the one to whom the prayer is directed</i>, and there are <i>no 
  exceptions</i> mentioned anywhere in Scripture. He is that jealous!</p>
