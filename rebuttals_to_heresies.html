  <p><font size="3">The Adventist teaching objected to is the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">The ministration of the priest throughout the 
    year in the first apartment of the sanctuary, &quot;within the veil&quot; which formed 
    the door and separated the holy place from the outer court, represents the 
    work of ministration upon which Christ entered at His ascension. It was the 
    work of the priest in the</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">pg. </font><font size="3">421<br>
    <br>
    daily ministration to present before God the blood of the sin offering, also 
    the incense which ascended with the prayers of Israel. So did Christ plead 
    His blood before the Father in behalf of sinners, and present before Him 
    also, with the precious fragrance of His own righteousness, the prayers of 
    penitent believers. Such was the work of ministration in the first apartment 
    of the sanctuary in heaven.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">Thither the faith of Christ's disciples 
    followed Him as He ascended from their sight. Here their hopes centered, 
    &quot;which hope we have,&quot; said Paul, &quot;as an anchor of the soul, both sure and 
    steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; whither the 
    forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest forever.&quot; 
    &quot;Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered 
    in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.&quot; 
    Hebrews 6:19, 20; 9:12.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">For eighteen centuries this work of 
    ministration continued in the first apartment of the sanctuary. The blood of 
    Christ, pleaded in behalf of penitent believers, secured their pardon and 
    acceptance with the Father, yet their sins still remained upon the books of 
    record. As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the close 
    of the year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of men is completed 
    there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin from the sanctuary. This 
    is the service which began when the 2300 days ended. At that time, as 
    foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High Priest entered the most holy, to 
    perform the last division of His solemn work--to cleanse the sanctuary.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">As anciently the sins of the people were by 
    faith placed upon the sin offering and through its blood transferred, in 
    figure, to the earthly sanctuary, so in the new covenant the sins of the 
    repentant are by faith placed upon Christ and transferred, in fact, to the 
    heavenly sanctuary. And as the typical cleansing of the earthly was 
    accomplished by the removal of the sins by which it had been polluted, so 
    the actual cleansing of the heavenly is to be accomplished by</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">pg. </font><font size="3">422<br>
    <br>
    the removal, or blotting out, of the sins which are there recorded. But 
    before this can be accomplished, there must be an examination of the books 
    of record to determine who, through repentance of sin and faith in Christ, 
    are entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The cleansing of the 
    sanctuary therefore involves a work of investigation--a work of judgment. 
    This work must be performed prior to the coming of Christ to redeem His 
    people; for when He comes, His reward is with Him to give to every man 
    according to his works. Revelation 22:12.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3">Thus those who followed in the light of the 
    prophetic word saw that, instead of coming to the earth at the termination 
    of the 2300 days in 1844, Christ then entered the most holy place of the 
    heavenly sanctuary to perform the closing work of atonement preparatory to 
    His coming.<i><br>

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
  Yes, as the sanctuary service demonstrated, sin was indeed confessed and 
  pardoned, yet the record of the sin remained in the form of the sacrificial 
  blood taken into the sanctuary. This bloody record of sins was not cleansed 
  from the sanctuary until the Day of Atonement, as these preceding paragraphs 
  of <i>Great Controversy</i> explain:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" 
    style="tab-stops:.1in .3in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in">
    Important truths concerning the atonement are taught by the typical service. 
    A substitute was accepted in the sinner's stead; but the sin was not 
    canceled by the blood of the victim. A means was thus provided by which it 
    was transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering of blood the sinner 
    acknowledged the authority of the law, confessed his guilt in transgression, 
    and expressed his desire for pardon through faith in a Redeemer to come; but 
    he was not yet entirely released from the condemnation of the law. On the 
    Day of Atonement the high priest, having taken an offering from the 
    congregation, went into the most holy place with the blood of this offering, 
    and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, directly over the law, to make 
    satisfaction for its claims. Then, in his character of mediator, he took the 
    sins upon himself and bore them from the sanctuary. Placing his hands upon 
    the head of the scapegoat, he confessed over him all these sins, thus in 
    figure transferring them from himself to the goat. The goat then bore them 
    away, and they were regarded as forever separated from the people.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" 
    style="tab-stops:.1in .3in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 2.0in 2.5in 3.0in 3.5in 4.0in 4.5in">
    Such was the service performed &quot;unto the example and shadow of heavenly 
    things.&quot; And what was done in type in the ministration of the earthly 
    sanctuary is done in reality in the ministration of the heavenly sanctuary. 
    After His ascension our Saviour began His work as our high priest. Says 
    Paul: &quot;Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are 
    the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the 
    presence of God for us.&quot; Hebrews 9:24.</p>

  Next the following objection is raised in the indictment:</p>
  <blockquote>

      </table>
      </center>
    </div>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.1in">This objection is the result of a 
  lack of understanding of the typical work of the priest in the Hebrew 
  sanctuary. The sinner who brought a lamb for sacrifice to the temple, slew 
  that lamb that represented Christ, and walked away in the knowledge that the 
  price for his sins had been paid in full, and the sins forgiven. Yet a record 
  of that sin remained in the blood that was taken into the sanctuary. The Day 
  of Atonement was only one day a year, the 10th day of the seventh month 
  (Lev:23:27), and on that day the High Priest came into the Holy of Holies and 
  made atonement for the people of God, and on <i>that</i> day the sanctuary 
  (temple) was cleansed of the record of sin.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.1in">The objection continues:</p>

  <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">
  On the contrary, the Bible is quite specific:</span></p>

    holy temple, the LORD'S throne is in heaven</b>: his eyes behold, his 
    eyelids try, the children of men.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.1in">Heb 8:3 For every high priest is 
    ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that 
    this man have somewhat also to offer.<br>
    Heb 8:4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that 
    there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:<br>
    Heb 8:5 Who serve unto the example and <b>shadow of heavenly things</b>, as
    <b>Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: 
    for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern 
    showed to thee in the mount. </b>(Exo. 25:9)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.1in">Rev 11:19 And <b>the temple of 
    God was opened in heaven</b>, and there was seen in his temple the ark of 
    his testament:</p>

    out of <b>the temple which is in heaven</b>, he also having a sharp sickle.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.1in">Rev 15:5 And after that I 
    looked, and, behold, <b>the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in

  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:.1in">There indeed is a heavenly 
  sanctuary / temple, and the earthly versions were based on the pattern of the 
  heavenly shown to Moses on Sinai. Clearly the objection to a heavenly temple 
  is based on ignorance of what the Bible clearly teaches. The objection

  One again, this objection displays, for all to see, the depth of ignorance the 
  author has of the Bible. I offer the following passage as proof positive that 
  what Ellen White and Adventists teach is indeed found in scripture:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Lev 16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; 
    one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.<br>
    Lev 16:9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and 
    offer him for a sin offering.<br>
    Lev 16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be 
    presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let 
    him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Lev 16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling 
    the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he 
    shall bring the live goat:<br>
    Lev 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, 
    and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all 
    their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the 
    goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:<br>
    Lev 16:22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land 
    not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal">I think nothing more need be addressed on this point, as 
  it is clearly demonstrated that the author of the indictment against Adventist 
  teaching knows nothing about the biblical facts of the issue.</p>

    <p>The idea that Christ was born of an immaculate or sinless mother,* 
    inherited no tendencies to sin, and for this reason did not sin, removes Him 
    from the realm of a fallen world, and from the very place where help is 
    needed. On His human side, Christ inherited just what every child of Adam 
    inherits–a sinful nature. On the divine side, from His very conception He 
    was begotten and born of the Spirit. And all this was done to place mankind 
    on vantage-ground, and to demonstrate that in <i>the same way</i> everyone 
    who is &quot;born of the Spirit&quot; may gain like victories over sin in his own 
    sinful flesh. Thus each one is to overcome <i>as Christ overcame</i> (Rev.

    salvation from sin, John 3: 3-7.</p>

  <p align="left">I would respond by asking the Protestant reader if they 
  believe that Mary was a sinner like the rest of us, or was she &quot;immaculate&quot;, 
  i.e. without sin her entire life as papal Romanism decrees? Well, if she was 
  indeed a sinner with a fallen nature like the rest of us, then what kind of 
  nature was she able to pass on to her children? Could she have passed on 
  anything to her children at birth but the fallen nature she possessed? That is 
  really the crux of the quote in <i>Bible Readings, </i>it is taking issue with 
  the Roman Catholic teaching of the Immaculate Conception and alleged lifetime 
  sinlessness of Mary.</p>

  <p>The passage cited from page 545 of <i>Great Controversy</i> is clear, 
  &quot;natural immortality&quot; means &quot;consciousness in death.&quot; As a further 
  clarification I offer the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Revelator says, &quot;I saw another angel come down from heaven, having 
    great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried 
    mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is 
    fallen&quot; (Rev. 18:1, 2). This is the same message that was given by the 
    second angel--Babylon is fallen, &quot;because she made all nations drink of the 
    wine of the wrath of her fornication&quot; (chap 14:8). What is that wine? Her 
    false doctrines. She has given to the world a false sabbath instead of the 
    Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and has repeated the lie Satan first told 
    to Eve in Eden--<b>the natural immortality of the soul</b>. Many kindred 
    errors she has spread far and wide, &quot;teaching for doctrines the commandments 
    of men.&quot;</p>
    <p>Source: <i>Selected Messages, </i>by Ellen White<i>, </i>Book 3, page 405<b>.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You see, the majority of Protestant Christianity believes that there is an 
  immortal soul that survives death to take up immediate residence in heaven or 
  hell. Catholicism adds to that a third destination for the immortal soul, that 
  of purgatory. So most Christians wrongly believe that everyone continues to 
  exist in a conscious state even immediately after death, in practical effect 
  denying death altogether, reducing it to the shedding of an unneeded body. So 
  while the authors of the indictment &quot;see thousands dying around us every day&quot;, 
  they don't believe that the dead are <i>really and truly</i> dead.</p>

  <p>Ellen White is clearly stating that the teaching of eternal torment in hell
  <i><b>is opposed to what is taught in Scripture.</b></i> Her reference to the 
  &quot;feelings of humanity&quot; is saying that the thought of God perpetually 
  tormenting people in hell forever is <i>inhumane</i>, sadistic in nature, 
  against every rational notion of a loving God. Humans will shoot a horse 
  rather than let it suffer, and put it out of its misery. Are humans more 
  humane than a God who many believe will torture sinners forever and ever? Who

  Adventists are well aware that the Roman Catholic Church in the Council of

  What then follows in the indictment is a list of quotations of early church

  <span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Consequently no amount of testimony by 
  early church fathers, regarding the keeping of Sunday, carries any doctrinal 
  weight or authority to the true believer in Sola Scriptura. That Sunday was 
  being kept early in the church is undeniable, but it has absolutely no 
  scriptural mandate from Christ or His Apostles.</span></p>
