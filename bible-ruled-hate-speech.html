  JUDGMENT BARCLAY J.<br>
  December 11, 2002<br></center>
  <br>
  [1] This is an appeal from the decision of a Board of Inquiry (the &quot;Board&quot;) 
  appointed by the Minister of Justice pursuant to s. 29 of The Saskatchewan 
  Human Rights Code, S.S. 1979, c. S-24.1, as am. (the &quot;Code&quot;). The Board 
  inquired into three complaints: Jeff Dodds v. Hugh Owens, dated August 5, 
  1997, Jason Roy v. Hugh Owens, dated August 6, 1997 and Gens Hellquist v. High 
  Owens dated August 12, 1997, all of which are complaints filed pursuant to s. 
  27 of the Code.<br>
  <br>
  [2] Each of the complainants, Dodds, Roy and Hellquist, is a gay male. Each 
  complained concerning the same actions of Hugh Owens (the &quot;appellant&quot;).<br>
  <br>
  [3] The hearing was held from August 23, 1999 to August 30, 1999 and the Board 
  rendered its decision on June 15, 2001. The Board found that the appellant 
  violated s. 14 of the Code by publishing an advertisement for certain bumper 
  stickers in the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix. Section 14 of the Code as it read
  at that time states:<br>
  <br>
  14(1) No person shall publish or display, or cause or permit to be published 
  or displayed, on any lands or premises or in a newspaper, through a television 
  or radio broadcasting station or any other broadcasting device, or in any 
  printed matter or publication or by means of any other medium that he owns, 
  controls, distributes or sells, any representation, including without 
  restricting the generality of the foregoing, any notice, sign, symbol, emblem, 
  article, statement or other representation:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">(a) tending or likely to tend to 
  deprive, abridge or otherwise restrict the enjoyment by any person or class of 
  persons of any right to which he is or they are entitled under law; or <br>
  <br>
  (b) which exposes, or tends to expose, to hatred, ridicules, belittles or 
  otherwise affronts the dignity of any person, any class of persons or a group 
  of persons; because of his or their race, creed, religion, colour, sex, sexual 
  orientation, family status, marital status, disability, age, nationality, 
  ancestry, place of origin or receipt of public assistance. <br>
  <br>
  (2) Nothing in subsection (1) restricts the right to freedom of speech under 
  the law upon any subject.<br>
  <br>
  The Board found that the advertisement of the bumper stickers exposed the 
  complainants to hatred, ridicule and an affront to their dignity because of 
  their sexual orientation contrary to this section. The appellant appeals the 
  Board's decision pursuant to s. 32 of the Code. This section allows any party 
  to appeal a Board's decision but only on a question of law.<br>
  <br>
  [4] Similar complaints were filed by each of the same complainants against the 
  Saskatoon Star-Phoenix and the Board also dealt with those complaints. The 
  Board found that the Star-Phoenix violated the Code by publishing the said 
  advertisement. That decision is not under appeal.<br>
  <br>
  [5] At the Board hearing, each of the individual complainants testified. 
  However, none of the complainants independently presented evidence or 
  argument. Each relied on the submissions of the Commission. On this appeal, 
  the complainants continue to rely on the Commission and are not active parties 
  in these proceedings.<br>
  <br>
  [6] On June 30, 1997, the Star-Phoenix published an advertisement for certain 
  bumper stickers. The appellant admitted that he placed the advertisement and 
  that, in fact, he had available for sale the bumper stickers that were 
  advertised. The advertisement was simply a copy of one of the bumper stickers 
  with the following words displayed on the bottom of the sticker: &quot;This message 
  can be purchased in bumper sticker form. Please call 306-584-2611.&quot; In fact, 
  this sticker and three similar stickers were offered for sale by the 
  appellant.<br>
  <br>
  [7] The bumper sticker in the advertisement displayed references to four Bible 
  passages: Romans 1, Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, 
  on the left side of the sticker. An equal sign (=) was situated in the middle 
  of the sticker, with a symbol on the right side of the sticker. The symbol on 
  the right side was comprised of two males holding hands with the universal 
  symbol of a red circle with a diagonal bar superimposed over top. The Board 
  noted, citing the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission v. 
  Bell (1994), 120 Sask. R. 122, that the red slash and circle is &quot;the universal 
  symbol for forbidden, not allowed or not wanted.&quot; The Bible passages read as 
  follows:<br>
  <br>
  Romans 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their 
  women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men 
  also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for 
  one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in 
  themselves the due penalty for their perversion. Furthermore, since they did 
  not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a 
  depraved mind, to&nbsp; do what ought not to be done. They have become filled 
  with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of 
  envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, 
  God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; 
  they disobey their parents; they are senseless, faithless, heartless, 
  ruthless. Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such 
  things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also 
  approve of those who practice them.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Leviticus 18:22 &quot;Do not lie with a man 
  as one lies with a woman; that is detestable.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Leviticus 20:13 &quot;If a man lies with a 
  man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They 
  must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">1 Corinthians 6:9 Do you know that the 
  wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the 
  sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor 
  homosexual offenders ....<br>
  <br>
  [8] The complainants and a number of experts in human sexuality, various 
  religions and religious fundamentalism testified as to the message of the 
  sticker and the impact of that message. The Board referred to Canadian (Human 
  Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892 and the Bell case, supra, 
  and decided that it had to determine on an objective basis whether the 
  advertisement violated s. 14 of the Code. The Board defined the issue as being 
  &quot;whether or not the effect of the publication of the advertisement exposed or 
  tended to expose to hatred, or otherwise affronted the dignity of gay men and 
  caused or tended to cause others to engage in discriminatory practices against 
  gay men in contravention of
  Part 2 of the Code.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  [9] In the Bell case, supra, the court dealt with similar stickers. But the 
  Board observed that the representation of gay men was more neutral than the 
  demeaning caricatures used on the stickers considered in the Bell case. It 
  commented that the universal symbol &quot;may itself not communicate hatred.&quot; 
  However, viewing the sticker in its totality, the Board concluded:<br>
  <br>
  The use of the circle and the slash combined with the passages of the Bible 
  herein make the meaning of the advertisement unmistakable. It is clear that 
  the advertisement is intended to make the group depicted appear to be inferior 
  or not wanted at best. When combined with the Biblical quotations, the 
  advertisement may result in a much stronger meaning. It is obvious that 
  certain of the Biblical quotations suggest more dire consequences and there 
  can be no question that the advertisement can objectively be seen as exposing 
  homosexuals to hatred or ridicule.<br>
  <br>
  [10] Having found that the advertisement violated s. 14(1) by exposing 
  homosexuals to hatred or ridicule, the Board cited the Bell case in concluding 
  that the communication was not protected by either of ss. 5 or 14(2) of the 
  Code, which deal with freedom of expression and speech. Nor did s. 14(1) 
  violate s. 2(b) of the Charter, in that the restriction placed on freedom of 
  expression constituted a reasonable limit under
  s. 1 of the Charter.<br>
  <br>
  [11] The finding of the Board that the advertisement did expose homosexuals to 
  hatred and ridicule accords with the appellant's own opinion as to the impact 
  of the message contained in the advertisement and the bumper sticker.<br>
  <br>
  [12] The appellant in his testing believes that homosexuals, by being who they 
  are, are committing a sin for which they should be put to death. Furthermore, 
  the passages from the Bible, which are cited in the bumper sticker and in the 
  advertisement, constitute the appellant's authority for
  this belief. This belief motivates the message in the bumper sticker and the 
  advertisement. The most favourable interpretation that could be given to the 
  bumper stickers is that because the Bible sanctions the execution of 
  homosexuals, we should be allowed to at least prohibit their activities.
  However, the Board observed there is a more sinister interpretation.<br>
  <br>
  [13] Although there were a number of procedural issues raised in the notice of 
  appeal, they were not seriously argued and in any event, in my view, they are 
  without merit. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">[14] I will deal with the substantive 
  issues.<br>
  <br>
  (a) Did the Board misapprehend the facts?<br>
  <br>
  (b) Did the Board apply the wrong test in determining that the advertisement 
  and the bumper sticker it represented violated s. 14(1) of the Code?<br>
  <br>
  (c) Is the advertisement in this case protected by the right to freedom of 
  religion and freedom of expression?<br>
  <br>
  (a) Did the Board misapprehend the facts?<br>
  <br>
  [15] The appellant argues that the Board erred in law when it described the 
  advertisement as consisting of four passages from the Bible in red ink. He 
  further submits that the advertisement does not consist of four passages from 
  the Bible, but a list of four Bible references in red ink. Although the ground 
  may not disclose a point of law, in any event, it is factually incorrect. In 
  my view the Board did not misapprehend the nature of the publication. It is 
  significant that the actual bumper stickers and advertisement were filed as 
  exhibits. Finally, when the Board analyzed whether the advertisement violated 
  s. 14, it described the advertisement as containing four references to Bible 
  passages.<br>
  <br>
  (b) Did the Board apply the wrong test in determining that the advertisement 
  and the bumper sticker it represented violated s. 14(1) of the Code?<br>
  <br>
  [16] The appellant argues that the Board made a number of errors in 
  determining whether the advertisement and the bumper stickers they represented 
  violated s. 14(1). The appellant further submits that the Board failed to 
  consider what constitutes sexual orientation.<br>
  <br>
  [17] The controlling authority as to what criteria is to be applied by the 
  Board in determining whether there has been a violation of s. 14(1) of the 
  Code is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada Human Rights 
  Commission v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892. The Supreme Court held that the 
  Board must use an objective test. The effect of this approach is that the 
  intention of the appellant in placing the ad is
  irrelevant. In Bell, supra, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal also prescribed 
  an objective test in determining whether there
  has been a violation of s. 14(1) of the Code.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">[18] The legislative intention of s. 
  14(1) of the Code was canvassed by Cameron J. in Human Rights Commission 
  (Sask.) v. Engineering Students' Society, University of Saskatchewan (1989), 
  72 Sask. R. 161. At p. 171, et seq. he states:<br>
  <br>
  [28] The objects of this Act are set forth in s. 3. The first and most general 
  of them is concerned with principle-and is dedicated to gaining greater public 
  recognition, first of that fundamental idea underlying our society which holds 
  that each member of the community is inherently possessed, in equal measure, 
  of human worth and dignity, and, second, of the derivative concept that each 
  is therefore entitled to be treated, and in turn required to treat every 
  other, as equally worthy of respect and concern (s. 3(a))). The second 
  purpose, more specific than the first, is to further public policy in 
  Saskatchewan which, rooted in these concepts, is aimed at discouraging and 
  eliminating discrimination (s. 3(b)).<br>
  ...<br>
  [48] Section 14(1) had added to it in 1979, immediately after the provision 
  prohibiting the publication or display of &quot;any notice, sign, symbol, emblem or 
  other representation&quot; which tends to interfere with the enjoyment by persons 
  of the rights accorded to them by the law, the following words:</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">&quot;... or which exposes or tends to expose 
  to hatred, ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any 
  person, any class of persons of a group of persons ... [because of his/her or 
  their race, colour, sex and so on].&quot;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">[49] The addition is quite clearly 
  directed at discouraging, if not eliminating, activity which reinforces 
  prejudice and in turn fosters discrimination. Hence the section acquired a 
  second purpose: to discourage some of the underlying causes of &quot;the certain 
  discriminatory practices&quot; covered by Part II.<br>
  ...<br>
  [59] Before turning to the express language of the section, we might say that 
  we have concluded in light of the foregoing that the section requires, by 
  implication, that the message have a specific effect or effects in order to be 
  caught by the section. The message must not only ridicule, belittle or 
  otherwise affront the dignity of the person or the class, it must be such as 
  to cause or be likely to cause others to engage in one or more of the 
  discriminatory practices prohibited by ss. 9 through 13 and 15 through 19.<br>
  <br>
  [19] The Board concluded that the stick figures combined with the Biblical 
  passages would expose homosexuals to hatred and ridicule.<br>
  <br>
  [20] At pp. 11 and 12 the Board states:<br>
  <br>
  Having reviewed all of the evidence, the Board accepts that the universal 
  symbol for forbidden, not allowed or not wanted, consisting of a circle with a 
  slash through it, may itself not communicate hatred. However, when combined 
  with the passages from the Bible, the Board finds that the
  advertisement would expose or tend to expose homosexuals to hatred or 
  ridicule, or may otherwise affront their dignity on the basis of their sexual 
  orientation. It is a combination of both the symbol and the biblical 
  references which have lead to this conclusion.<br>
  <br>
  [21] In my view the Board was correct in concluding that the advertisement can 
  objectively be seen as exposing homosexuals to hatred or ridicule. When the 
  use of the circle and slash is combined with the passages of the Bible, it 
  exposes homosexuals to detestation, vilification and
  disgrace. In other words, the Biblical passage which suggest that if a man 
  lies with a man they must be put to death exposes homosexuals to hatred.<br>
  <br>
  [22] I agree with counsel for the Board that the Board was correct in holding 
  that a reference to statements that call for homosexuals to be put to death in 
  the context of equalizing that with a prohibition against them does expose 
  homosexuals to hatred and affronts to their dignity as
  contemplated by s. 14(1) of the Code.<br>
  <br>
  (c) Is the advertisement in the case at bar protected by the right to freedom 
  of religion and freedom of expression?<br>
  <br>
  [23] In the Bell case, supra, at pp. 132 and 133, Sherstobitoff J.A. states:<br>
  <br>
  [29] Insofar as s. 14 prohibits display of material exposing or tending to 
  expose to hatred because of race or religion, it is unquestionably a 
  reasonable limit for all of the reasons stated by Dickson, C.J., in Taylor. We 
  are bound by those reasons and agree with them. Since we have found that the 
  stickers exposed and tended to expose to hatred, there has been a breach of 
  the section, and, ordinarily, that would be an
  end of the appeal.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">[30] However, s. 14 goes beyond 
  prohibiting material exposing to hatred. It also prohibits material which 
  ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any group because of 
  race or religion. The appellant argued that these additional grounds for 
  prohibition of publication broadened the section to the extent that the 
  reasoning in Taylor should not apply, and that, as a result, s. 14 was not a 
  reasonable limit on the right to freedom of expression.<br>
  ...<br>
  [33] Accordingly, in our view, s. 14 of the Code is a reasonable limit on the 
  right to freedom of expression as allowed under s. 1 of the Charter. Our 
  reasons for this conclusion are rather perfunctory because the result of this 
  appeal would be the same even if we had concluded that the words &quot;ridicules, 
  belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of&quot; in s. 14(1)(a) had taken the 
  section beyond the reasoning in Taylor which
  justified the limit as being reasonable.<br>
  <br>
  [24] In my view, s. 14(1) of the Code is a reasonable restriction on the 
  appellant's right to freedom of expression and religion as contemplated by s. 
  2(a) of the Charter. See Bell, supra. In Ross v. New Brunswick School District 
  No. 15, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825, La Forest J. held that the analysis under s. 1 of 
  the Charter is the same whether the legislation infringes the respondent's 
  freedom of expression or freedom of religion.<br>
  <br>
  [25] For all the above reasons the appeal is dismissed.<br>
  <br>
  [26] Costs may be spoken to.</font></p>
