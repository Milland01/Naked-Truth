  <p>Quotes from scripture are from the King James unless otherwise noted:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness 
    of Judaea,<br>
    Mat 3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br>
    Mat 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The 
    voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make 
    his paths straight.<br>
    Mat 3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern 
    girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.<br>
    Mat 3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region 
    round about Jordan,<br>
    Mat 3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
    <p>Mat 3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be 
    baptized of him.<br>
    Mat 3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, 
    and comest thou to me?<br>
    Mat 3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus 
    it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.<br>
    Mat 3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the 
    water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of 
    God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:<br>
    Mat 3:17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom 
    I am well pleased. </p>
    <p>Mark 1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of 
    repentance for the remission of sins.<br>
    Mark 1:5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of 
    Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing 
    their sins. </p>
    <p>John 3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because 
    there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that John the Baptist did his baptizing in the river Jordan. Ever 
  wonder why? A clue is in the definition of baptism. Here are the Greek words 
  used in connection with baptism, from Strong's Greek dictionary: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>G907. baptizo, bap-tid'-zo; from a der. of G911; <strong>to make whelmed 
    (i.e. fully wet)</strong>; used only (in the N.T.) of ceremonial ablution, 
    espec. (techn.) of the ordinance of Chr. baptism:--baptist, baptize, wash.</p>
    <p>G908. baptisma, bap'-tis-mah; from G907; baptism (techn. or 
    fig.):--baptism. </p>
    <p>G909. baptismos, bap-tis-mos'; from G907; ablution (cerem. or Chr.):--baptism, 
    washing. </p>
    <p>G910. Baptistes, bap-tis-tace'; from G907; a baptizer, as an epithet of 
    Christ's forerunner:--Baptist. </p>
    <p>G911. bapto, bap'-to; a prim. verb; <strong>to whelm, i.e. cover wholly 
    with a fluid</strong>; in the N.T. only in a qualified or spec. sense, i.e. 
    (lit.) to moisten (a part of one's person), or (by impl.) to stain (as with 
    dye):--dip. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Apostolic baptism was by full immersion, and that is why John the Baptist 
  used the river Jordan. In other words, the one being baptized was fully dunked 
  under the water, which is clear from the Greek and even acknowledged by the 
  Catholic Church:</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <strong>
    <p>1214</strong><spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="20"> This sacrament is 
    called <em>Baptism</em>, after the central rite by which it is carried out: 
    to baptize (Greek <em>baptizein</em>) means to &quot;plunge&quot; or &quot;immerse&quot;; the 
    &quot;plunge&quot; into the water symbolizes the catechumen's burial into Christ's 
    death (<em>628</em>), from which he rises up by resurrection with him, as &quot;a 
    new creature.&quot;(6)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Source: <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>, published by Liguori 
  Publications, English translation copyright 1994 by the United States Catholic 
  Conference, Inc.--Libreria Editrice Vaticana, bearing the Imprimi Potest of 
  Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, page 312.</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>So the New Testament only speaks of baptism by immersion. However, some may 
  point to the book of Ezekiel to validate baptism by sprinkling: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be 
    clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse 
    you.<br>
    Ezek 36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put 
    within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I 
    will give you an heart of flesh.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sprinkling of water <em>was</em> part of Israel's ritual cleansing 
  ceremonies (see Numbers 8:7, 19:13, 17-21), which Ezekiel alludes to, but not 
  a single instance of baptism by this method can be verified anywhere in the 
  New Testament. Baptism was <em>only</em> by full immersion. The common 
  practice today of baptism by sprinkling or pouring is simply not supported by 
  the New Testament. It is therefore, nothing but the tradition of men. </p>
  <p>Yet, some may point to Pentecost (Acts 2:41) and use the following rational 
  to justify baptism by pouring: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;At Pentecost, the thousands who were baptized could not have been 
    baptized by immersion -- Jerusalem had no body of water large enough. (Water 
    was [and is] piped in to the city.) The converts must have been baptized by 
    pouring.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This makes you think that there were no large bodies of water in Jerusalem, 
  that water was piped directly into homes, in sinks and bathtubs like today, 
  which would make the task of baptizing 3000 by immersion impractical. Most any 
  map of Jerusalem in New Testament times will show there were the following 
  pools of water in the immediate vicinity: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Serpent's Pool - to the southwest</li>
      <li>Tower's Pool - to the west</li>
      <li>Strouthion Pool - to the northwest</li>
      <li>Sheep Pool - to the north</li>
      <li>Pool of Israel - to the north</li>
      <li>Pool of Bethesda - to the north by the sheep gate</li>
      <li>Pool of Siloam - to the south</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Pool of Siloam is mentioned in John 9:7-11 as the place where a blind 
  man received his sight after washing there. Another, the Pool of Bethesda is 
  mentioned in John 5:2-7 which was by the Sheep Gate and frequented by the sick 
  and lame looking for healing. </p>
  <p>In Palestine, water is frequently stored in very large cisterns cut into 
  the rock, some large enough to have spiral staircases cut into them so that 
  one could walk down to the water level to draw water. There would have been an 
  ample number of such pools and/or cisterns in the immediate vicinity of 
  Jerusalem with which to baptize 3000 people by immersion in one day. </p>
  <p>So why immersion? What is the reason for it? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus 
    Christ were baptized into his death?<br>
    Rom 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as 
    Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we 
    also should walk in newness of life.</p>
    <p>Col 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him 
    through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the 
    dead. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Baptism is symbolic of burial with Christ, which is the reason for full 
  immersion, and coming up out of the water is symbolic of being raised from the 
  dead to a new and eternal life. This symbolism is not effectively conveyed by 
  sprinkling or pouring. </p>
  <p>Another common practice is the baptism of infants soon after birth. Search 
  the New Testament and you will not find a single instance of an infant being 
  baptized. Here is what the Vatican Catechism says with regard to infant 
  baptism:</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>The Baptism of Infants</strong> </p>
  <p><strong>1250</strong><spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="20"> Born with a 
  fallen human nature and tainted by original sin, children also have need of 
  the new birth in Baptism to be freed from the power of darkness and brought 
  into the realm of the freedom of the children of God, to which all men are 
  called.(50) The sheer gratuitousness of the grace of salvation is particularly 
  manifest in infant Baptism. The Church and the parents would deny a child the 
  priceless grace of becoming a child of God where they not to confer Baptism 
  shortly after birth.(51) </p>
  <p><strong>1251</strong><spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="20"> Christian parents 
  will recognize that this practice also accords with their role as nurturers of 
  the life that God has entrusted to them.(52) </p>
  <p><strong>1252</strong><font size="-1">
  <spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="20">The practice of infant Baptism is an 
  immemorial tradition of the Church. There is explicit testimony to this 
  practice from the second century on, and it is quite possible that, from the 
  beginning of the apostolic preaching, when whole &quot;households&quot; received 
  baptism, infants may also have been baptized.</font>(53) </p>
  <p>50 Cf. Council of Trent (1546): DS 1514; cf. <em>Col</em> 1:12-14.<br>
  51 Cf. CIC, can. 867; CCEO, cann. 681;686, 1.<br>
  52 Cf. LG 11; 41; GS 48; CIC, can. 868.<br>
  53 Cf. <em>Acts</em> 16:15, 33; 18:8; 1 <em>Cor</em> 1:16; CDF, instruction,
  <em>Pastoralis actio</em>: AAS 72 (1980) 1137-1156.</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>The Catholic Church teaches that the act of Baptism cleanses one of 
  original sin, hence the perceived need to baptize infants, so that should they 
  die, they will die in a state of sinlessness and enter heaven. The thought 
  being that the infant that dies without baptism, dies still tainted by Adam's 
  inherited sin, and so cannot enter heaven. This kind of thinking stems from a 
  total misunderstanding of the purpose and function of baptism and how sin of 
  any kind is forgiven by God. These then are the scriptural references cited 
  above by the Catholic Catechism to support infant baptism: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the 
    city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord 
    opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.<br>
    Acts 16:15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, 
    saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, 
    and abide there. And she constrained us.</p>
    <p>Acts 16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou 
    shalt be saved, and thy house.<br>
    Acts 16:32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that 
    were in his house.<br>
    Acts 16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their 
    stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.<br>
    Acts 16:34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before 
    them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. </p>
    <p>Acts 18:8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the 
    Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and 
    were baptized. </p>
    <p>1 Cor 1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;<br>
    1 Cor 1:15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.<br>
    1 Cor 1:16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know 
    not whether I baptized any other. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>These above passages are cited to &quot;prove&quot; infant baptism, but this is 
  nothing more than sheer speculation. The fact remains that there is not a 
  single incident recorded in the New Testament where infant baptism can be 
  identified and really proved. </p>
  <p>So what does baptism really do? Can anyone, by baptizing an unwilling 
  participant, wash away sins and save them? Are forgiveness and salvation 
  dispensed like a commodity through a ceremony or sacrament by any church? Just 
  how are sins, any and all sins, washed away? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that 
    believeth not shall be damned.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ is the only one who can cleanse us of our sins. He took our 
  sins to the cross, and died because of them. By our faith in His atoning 
  death, we can be saved, because His blood was shed for the specific purpose of 
  washing away our sins. Note the sequence in the above verse. Believe and be 
  baptized and you will be saved. Belief comes first, and then baptism. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash 
    away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</p>
    <p>Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of 
    you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall 
    receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The act of baptism is not magical, and does not by itself cleanse anyone of 
  sins. That is not what these verses mean. A confessed faith in the atoning 
  death and resurrection of Jesus Christ is what really saves. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that 
    cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them 
    that diligently seek him.</p>
    <p>Mark 1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of 
    repentance for the remission of sins. </p>
    <p>Luke 12:8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him 
    shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:<br>
    Luke 12:9 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the 
    angels of God. </p>
    <p>Acts 19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of 
    repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which 
    should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.<br>
    Acts 19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord 
    Jesus. </p>
    <p>Rom 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and 
    shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou 
    shalt be saved.<br>
    Rom 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the 
    mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br>
    Rom 10:11 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be 
    ashamed. </p>
    <p>1 Pet 3:21 (NIV) and this water [of Noah's flood] symbolizes baptism that 
    now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of 
    a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus 
    Christ,<br>
    1 Pet 3:22 who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, 
    authorities and powers in submission to him. </p>
    <p>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us 
    our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those with faith will seek baptism as an outward sign of repentance, an 
  open confession before men and God of faith in Jesus Christ to cleanse them of 
  their sins. An infant, or child younger than the age of reason, cannot repent 
  of their sins or express their faith, so baptizing them does nothing to remove 
  their sins, and is therefore quite useless. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 8:12 But <b>when they believed</b> Philip preaching the things 
    concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, <b>they were 
    baptized</b>, both men and women.<br>
    Acts 8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he 
    continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which 
    were done.</p>
    <p>Acts 2:41 Then <b>they that gladly received his word were baptized</b>: 
    and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note what a Roman Catholic Catechism of the 19th century had to say on the 
  matter of infant baptism:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> Can Protestants prove to Anabaptists, that the 
    baptism of infants is good and useful?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. No; they cannot; because, according to Protestant 
    principles, such baptism is useless.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> Why do you say this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. One of the Protestant principles is, that no human 
    being can be justified, except by an act of faith in Jesus Christ; but no 
    infant is capable of making this act of faith; therefore, upon Protestant 
    principles, the baptism of infants is useless.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> Can you draw the same consequence from any other 
    principle?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. Yes; their first principle is, that nothing is to be 
    practised, which is not authorized by scriptural example; but it does not 
    appear from Scripture, that even one infant was ever baptized; therefore 
    Protestants should reject, on their own principle, infant baptism as an 
    unscriptural usage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> How do Anabaptists treat other Protestants?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. They boast that the Scripture is evidently for 
    Anabaptist practice; that other Protestants hold traditional doctrines like 
    Catholics. They quote Matt. xxvii., &quot;Go, <i>teach</i> all nations, baptizing 
    them,&quot; from which they say it is clear, that <i>teaching</i> should go 
    before baptism; hence, they conclude, that as infants cannot be taught, so 
    neither should they be baptized, until they are capable of teaching or 
    instruction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> What use do they make of </i>Mark xvi.: He who <i>
    believeth, </i>and is baptized, shall be saved?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They say it is evident that belief, or faith, must precede 
    baptism; but, they add, children or infants are not capable of believing; 
    therefore neither are they capable of being baptized.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> What can Protestants reply to this Anabaptist 
    reasoning?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. They may give these passages another meaning, but [pg. 
    153] they can never prove that their interpretation is better than that of 
    the Anabaptists, because they themselves give every one a right to interpret 
    Scripture.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> What inference do you draw from this?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. That every Protestant has much reason to doubt whether he be 
    baptized.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q.<i> How do Catholics prove that infants ought to be 
    baptized?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. Not from Scripture alone, which is not clear on this 
    subject, but from the Scripture which illustrated by the constant tradition 
    of the Church, which, in every age, administered baptism to infants, and 
    consequently the practice must have been derived from the Apostles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>Can Protestant use this triumphant argument of 
    tradition against the Anabaptists?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. No; they have no right to use it in this matter, where 
    it would serve them, since they reject it in every question, where it is 
    opposed to their novel and lately-invented doctrines.</p>
    <p>Source: <i>Controversial Catechism</i>, by the Rev. Stephen Keenan, 
    published in 1851 in Edinburgh; by C. Dolman, 13 South Hanover Street, and 
    61, New Bond Street, London, pp. 152,153.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Rev. Stephen Keenan makes the point that if you are a Protestant, and 
  hold to the principle of Sola Scriptura; the Bible only for doctrine; but you 
  were only baptized as an infant, then you have reason to doubt that your 
  baptism was valid, since infant baptism <i>cannot be proved from scripture!</i></p>
  <p>So, if you have faith in Christ, but have not yet been baptized, or if you 
  were baptized as an infant, or by mere sprinkling, you might want to consider 
  being baptized in the same biblical manner as Jesus was by John, as an adult 
  by full immersion, as an open confession of your faith before God and man that 
  you accept the death of Jesus Christ in your place to wash away your sins, and 
  that you lay claim to the promise of eternal life because of that faith: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, 
    that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting 
    life.</p>
    <p>Mat 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I 
    confess also before my Father which is in heaven.<br>
    Mat 10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny 
    before my Father which is in heaven. </p>
