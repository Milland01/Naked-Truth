<blockquote>
  <p>On the December 29th 2002 <i>Praise the Lord </i>program on TBN, Benny Hinn 
  prophesied major events in 2003 and gave dates for the events, both of which 
  have now failed to come to pass, again proving that Benny Hinn is a false 
  prophet, and not a man of God:</p>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">First Prophetic Date for 2003</font></u><font size="4"> 
  - </font><u><font color="#FF0000" size="5">FAILED</font></u></b></p>
  <p>On Monday, March 3rd, 2003, a mighty change in the anointing of the Holy 
  Spirit in the church was prophesied to occur:</p>

        <p>[Hinn] &quot;March 3rd. I just heard March 3rd in my ears. What's March 
        3rd? What day is that? We don't know. I don't know what March 3rd what 
        day that, that would, would be. I am not sure where I would be. I don't 
        know what crusade or service or maybe I am not anywhere, but I am, I am 
        hearing the Lord say that to me. Lift your hands and thank Him ladies 
        and gentlemen. Lift your hands and thank Him ladies and gentlemen. God 
        is sending a mighty - breath, a fresh wind upon - it's a Monday - a

  <p>It is worth noting that Benny Hinn's &quot;This Is Your Day&quot; program broadcast on March 3rd, 
  was a <i>pre-recorded</i> program taped <i>two weeks in advance,</i> at the 
  Covenant Partners Conference at the Atlanta Hyatt Regency (Feb. 19-21), though 
  Benny Hinn acted under the pretence that it really was March 3rd for the 
  program.</p>
  <p>Interestingly enough, March 3rd was also being promoted by, and to, non-Christians, as 
  a day of <i>change</i>:</p>

    <p align="left">To suggest that March 3rd 2003 was an important day, because 
    of the date being the number 3 tripled (03/03/03), and that 3 minutes of 
    prayer at 3:33 would be particularly effective, was nothing but<i> 
    superstition</i>, which the people of God should know to be <i>totally 
    useless</i>, and something they should have no part in:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">2 Cor 6:14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with 
    unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? 
    and what communion hath light with darkness?<br>
    2 Cor 6:15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he 
    that believeth with an infidel?<br>
    2 Cor 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are 
    the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and 
    walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br>
    2 Cor 6:17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the 
    Lord, ...</p>

  <p>On or about April 15th, 2003 (3 1/2 months after Dec. 29th, 2002), Benny 
  Hinn prophesied that a great 
  event involving Israel will occur, to be followed by a mighty move of 
  God in the church:</p>

        - <a href="http://www.biblelight.info/Hinn-Israel.wmv">(Windows Media Best Quality)</a></b><p>&quot;Yes. 
        The glory of God is going to visit His mighty church. Yes Lord. Three 
        and a half months from now a great event is going to take place in the 
        world, followed by a mighty move of God in the church. Three and a half 
        months from now something is going to happen in this world: headline 
        news, you'll know it. I will not tell you what I see. You'll just know 
        it, and something mighty will follow in the Spirit. God, the Holy Ghost, 
        is saying to His church - Watch Israel. Watch my people Israel. You will 
        know as you read the scriptures and watch Israel. 'For the days are 
        short' says the Lord. 'The days ahead are evil' says the Lord, 'but I 
        have reserved a place for my people, a place of safety, a place of 
        protection.'&quot; </p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>It is most interesting that Benny Hinn refused to reveal the &quot;great event&quot; 
  he said the Holy Spirit was predicting through him, and neither would he give 
  a hard calendar date, rather he left it up to the audience to read the 
  headlines, and they would &quot;just know it&quot; when it happened. Well the three and 
  a half months have now passed, and no great event concerning Israel happened 
  at the predicted time. Benny Hinn's prophesies consistently fail to come to 
  pass, which is no surprise considering the long and abysmal track record Benny 
  Hinn has established as a false prophet. God does not speak to Benny Hinn, he 
  does NOT hear from the Holy Spirit, and his failed prophesies prove this 
  beyond any doubt.</p>
