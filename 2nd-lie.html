<title>The Second Lie In The Garden of Eden</title>
</head>

<body>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">The Second Lie In The Garden of Eden<br>
  You Shall Be As Gods</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>From the Roman Catholic Douay Rheims Bible:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:4&nbsp;And the serpent said to the woman: <b>No, you shall not die the 
    death</b> [the first lie]. <br>
    Gen 3:5&nbsp;For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, 
    your eyes shall be opened: and <b>you shall be as Gods</b> [the second lie], 
    knowing good and evil.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the guise of the serpent, Satan told Eve that she could become as God. 
  Scripture tells us that Satan in his rebellious pride covets God's position of 
  authority:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 14:12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in 
    the morning? how art thou fallen to the earth, that didst wound the nations?<br>
    Isa 14:13 And thou saidst in thy heart: I will ascend into heaven, I will 
    exalt my throne above the stars of God, I will sit in the mountain of the 
    covenant, in the sides of the north.<br>
    Isa 14:14 I will ascend above the height of the clouds, <b>I will be like 
    the most High</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Satan seeks to take God's place, and his second lie in the garden of 
  Eden was to tell Eve she could become as God too. Note what scripture tells us 
  about the Antichrist power:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not 
    come, except there come a falling away first, and <b>that man of sin</b> be 
    revealed, the son of perdition;<br>
    2 Th 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or 
    that is worshipped; so that <b>he as God sitteth in the temple of God, 
    showing himself that he is God.</b><br>
    ...<br>
    2 Th 2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power 
    and signs and lying wonders,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the Antichrist power, whose working is like that of Satan, also seeks to 
  become his own God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>460</b> <span class="text">The Word became flesh to make us &quot;<i>partakers 
	of the divine nature</i>&quot;:<sup>78</sup> &quot;For this is why the Word became 
	man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into 
	communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a 
	son of God.&quot;<sup>79</sup> <strong>&quot;For the Son of God became man so that we 
	might become God.&quot;</strong><sup>80</sup> <strong>&quot;The only-begotten Son of 
	God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that 
	he, made man, might make men gods.</strong>&quot;<sup>81</sup></span></p>

  <p>Satan covets God's throne, and he seeks to be like the most High God. Be 
  your own God, Satan urged Eve. And the Catholic Church, in her most recent 
  magisterial Catechism, tells us we can become God too. This is a very old lie, 
  from the father of lies, and blasphemy of the highest order.
