</center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Col 2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your 
    flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all 
    trespasses;<br>
    Col 2:14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, 
    which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his 
    cross;<br>
    Col 2:15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of 
    them openly, triumphing over them in it.<br>
    Col 2:16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect 
    of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath <i>days</i>:<br>
    Col 2:17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What was nailed to the cross? Verse 13 states that those dead in their 
  sinful flesh have been made alive by Christ who forgives all their sins. So in 
  that context, verse 14 is clearly saying that the list of our trespasses, our 
  sins, our breaking of the Ten Commandments is nailed to the cross. We are 
  forgiven of all our sins at the cross. Verse 15 declares victory over the 
  works of Satan and his fallen angels at the cross.</p>
  <p>There are some who would point to Colossians 2:16 as evidence that today 
  the Christian is released by God from observing any holy day what-so-ever, 
  that the 10 Commandments themselves were nailed to the cross. The main reason 
  they cite this verse is to show that there is no need for the &quot;New Testament&quot; 
  Christian to observe the biblical Sabbath day (Saturday), and that anyone who 
  does advocate Sabbath keeping is a legalist and an enemy of salvation by grace 
  alone. Usually though, they do not quote verse 17, and rarely if ever do the 
  explain the relevance of verse 17.</p>
  <p>The passage should be considered as a complete sentence as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an 
    holyday, or of the new moon, or of <em><strong>the sabbath days which are a 
    shadow of things to come;</strong></em> but the body is of Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><strong>The Prophetic <em>Shadow</em> Sabbaths</strong></u></p>
  <p>Verse 17 is saying that the sabbath days referred to in verse 16 were 
  &quot;shadows&quot; of things to come. So what does that mean?  </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Heb 8:1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have 
  such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty 
  in the heavens;<br>
  Heb 8:2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the 
  Lord pitched, and not man.<br>
  Heb 8:3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: 
  wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.<br>
  Heb 8:4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there 
  are priests that offer gifts according to the law:<br>
  Heb 8:5 Who serve unto <u>the example and shadow of heavenly things</u>, as 
  Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, 
  See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern showed to 
  thee in the mount.</p>
  <p>Heb 9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of 
  all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:<br>
  Heb 9:9 <u>Which was a figure</u> for the time then present, in which were 
  offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the 
  service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;<br>
  Heb 9:10 Which stood only in <u>meats and drinks</u>, and divers washings, and carnal 
  ordinances, imposed on them <u>until the time of reformation</u>.<br>
  Heb 9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a 
  greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not 
  of this building;<br>
  Heb 9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he 
  entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for 
  us.</p>
  <p>Heb 10:1 For the law having <u>a shadow</u> of good things to come, and not 
  the very image of the things, can never with those <u>sacrifices which they 
  offered year by year</u> continually make the comers thereunto perfect.<br>
  Heb 10:2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the 
  worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.<br>
  Heb 10:3 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins 
  every year.<br>
  Heb 10:4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should 
  take away sins.<br>
  Heb 10:5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, <u>Sacrifice and 
  offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</u><br>
  Heb 10:6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.<br>
  Heb 10:7 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of 
  me,) to do thy will, O God.<br>
  Heb 10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and 
  offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are 
  offered by the law;<br>
  Heb 10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. <u>He taketh away the 
  first, that he may establish the second.</u><br>
  Heb 10:10 By the which will <u>we are sanctified through the offering of the 
  body of Jesus Christ once for all.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The law spoken of there is the ceremonial law, the yearly calendar 
  connected with the symbolic sacrificial system of animal sacrifices, and 
  offerings of food and drink at the Temple. As Heb 10:4 states, the animal 
  sacrifices were incapable of taking away sins, and those sacrifices were 
  offered repeatedly year by year (v. 1), according to the ceremonial law. These 
  powerless sacrifices could only remind the sinner of their sin (v. 3). But the 
  body of Christ is introduced in verse 5, which would be offered once to take 
  away sins (v. 10). As verse 9 states, the first (ceremonial animal sacrifices) 
  were taken away by the second, the sacrifice of Christ. So it is the 
  ceremonial system of animal sacrifices and their associated shadow sabbaths 
  that ended at the cross. That is also what Hebrews 9, cited above, is saying, that 
  this reformation happened with the shedding of Christ's blood, providing the 
  eternal redemption that was not possible by the animal sacrifices of the 
  earthly (first) tabernacle.</p>
  <p>Ezekiel refers to the ceremonial sacrificial offerings to be made at the 
  tabernacle in a way nearly identical to Colossians:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Ezek 45:17 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and 
  meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and 
  in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare 
  the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace 
  offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Scripture makes a distinction between the ten commandments and ceremonial 
  law, and speaks of the ceremonial law in the same way that 
  Colossians 2:14 does: </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Deu 4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to 
  perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.<br>
  Deu 4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and 
  judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Deu 31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the 
  sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the 
  elders of Israel.<br>
  Deu 31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, 
  in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,<br>
  Deu 31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the 
  place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in 
  their hearing.<br>
  ...<br>
  Deu 31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of <u>writing the 
  words of this law in a book</u>, until they were finished,<br>
  Deu 31:25 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant 
  of the LORD, saying,<br>
  Deu 31:26 Take this book of the law, and <u>put it in the side of the ark</u> 
  of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for <u>a witness 
  against thee.</u></p>
  <p>2 Chr 33:8 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of 
  the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed 
  to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the 
  <u>statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the yearly ceremonial days are ordinances (statutes):</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Num 9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone 
  of it: according to all the <u>ordinances [H2708. chuqqah] of the passover</u> they shall keep 
  it.<br>
  ...<br>
  Num 9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover 
  unto the LORD; according to <u>the ordinance [H2708. chuqqah] of the passover</u>, 
  and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have <u>one 
  ordinance</u>, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
  <p>Lev 16:29 And this shall be a <u>statute [H2708. chuqqah]</u> for ever unto you: 
  that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict 
  your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a 
  stranger that sojourneth among you:<br>
  ...<br>
  Lev 16:34 And this shall be an everlasting <u>statute [H2708. chuqqah]</u> unto you, 
  to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a 
  year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
  <p>Lev 23:39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have 
  gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven 
  days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a 
  sabbath.<br>
  Lev 23:40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, 
  branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the 
  brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.<br>
  Lev 23:41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. 
  It shall be a <u>statute [H2708. chuqqah]</u> for ever in your generations: ye 
  shall celebrate it in the seventh month.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The ceremonial law, the ordinances written by the hand of Moses in a book, was clearly 
  distinct from the Ten Commandments, which were written by the finger of God on 
  tables of stone. In Leviticus, Moses makes note of the fact that the yearly 
  ceremonial sabbaths, instituted for the purpose of offerings and sacrifices, were separate and 
  distinct from the weekly Sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Lev 23:37 These are the [yearly] feasts of the LORD, which ye shall 
  proclaim to be holy convocations [sabbaths], to offer an offering made by fire 
  unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink 
  offerings, every thing upon his day: [referred to in Col. 2:16-17]<br>
  Lev 23:38 Beside the [weekly seventh day] sabbaths of the LORD, and beside 
  your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, 
  which ye give unto the LORD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In other words, the yearly ceremonial sabbaths set forth in Leviticus 23 
  were distinct from, and in addition to, the seventh day weekly Sabbath of the 
  Lord, particularly with respect to the fact that sacrifices were necessary in 
  order to observe the symbolic ceremonial days.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 Chr 23:31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the 
  sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the 
  order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD:</p>
  <p>2 Chr 35:6 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your 
  brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD <u>by the hand of 
  Moses.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The yearly sabbaths were all set according to the new moons, which marked 
  the beginning of the month. They were observed in the order and on the dates 
  set by God at Sinai for the purpose of making sacrifices. The weekly seventh 
  day Sabbath commandment is distinctive, in that it does not have any intrinsic 
  requirement for sacrifices or burnt offerings (Exo. 20:8-11, Deut 5:12-15), 
  and it is not set by the new moon.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;Nehemiah also calls special attention to the seventh day Sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Neh 9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from 
  heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and 
  commandments:<br>
  Neh 9:14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them 
  precepts, statutes, and laws, <u>by the hand of Moses thy servant:</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The yearly ceremonial sabbaths that the Jews observed in connection with the Temple or Sanctuary 
  were a shadow, or prophetic in nature, of future events. Every year the Jews were acting out the plan of 
  salvation as demonstrated by the Temple sacrifices and ceremonies. The whole process was 
  designed as a play of sorts, to explain to everyone the exact sequence of 
  events in God's plan to redeem mankind. The focus of this plan, of course, is 
  Jesus Christ in his role as the Lamb of God, as well as his role of High 
  Priest or Mediator between God the Father and humanity. If you have not done 
  so yet, please read:</p>
  <p><strong><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="temple.html"> The Hebrew Sanctuary</a> </strong>and<br>
  <strong><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="feasts.html"> The Biblical Feast Days</a>.</p>
  </strong>
  <p>It is essential that one have a basic understanding of the ceremonial 
  calendar associated with the Hebrew Sanctuary. God intended the Sanctuary and it's 
  services as an instructional tool to teach all people His plan of salvation, 
  and I believe every Christian can benefit greatly from studying it. It has 
  particular relevance near the end of time, because it lays out in detail the 
  sequential process of events that God is using and will follow in the very 
  near future.</p>
  <p>In brief, these were the yearly ceremonial days observed and associated sabbaths.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Spring Calendar:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Passover, The crucifixion, Jesus is God's Passover Lamb. (14 Nisan, 
	  not a Sabbath)</li>
      <li>Feast of Unleavened Bread (Pilgrimage to Jerusalem required for all 
      men.) Putting away sin from one's life.
      <ul>
        <li>Sabbath of 15 Nisan, 1st day of the feast.</li>
        <li>The Omer, first fruits of the barley harvest, 16 Nisan. 
        Resurrection.</li>
        <li>Sabbath of 21 Nisan, 7th and last day of the feast.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Feast of Weeks - Pentecost, a sabbath day 50 days after the Omer 
      (Pilgrimage to Jerusalem required for all men.) Firstfruits of the wheat 
      harvest. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Fall Calendar:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trumpets, Sabbath of 1 Tishri, Announcement of impending 
      judgment.</li>
      <li>Day of Atonement, Sabbath of 10 Tishri, The pre-Advent Judgment.</li>
      <li>Feast of Tabernacles (Pilgrimage to Jerusalem required for all men.) The ingathering of God's people - the second 
      coming.
      <ul>
        <li>Sabbath of 15 Tishri, 1st day of Tabernacles, freed from the bondage 
        of sin.</li>
        <li>Sabbath of 22 Tishri, 8th and last day of Tabernacles.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Prior to the incarnation of Jesus and his crucifixion, all the above 
  festivals awaited their fulfillment. They were what are called &quot;types&quot;. They 
  were symbolic of specific events yet to come. The event that is foretold is 
  referred to as the &quot;antitype&quot;. In the New Testament, the Greek words 
  corresponding to type and antitype are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>G5179. tupos, too'-pos; from G5180; a die (as struck), i.e. (by impl.) a 
    stamp or scar; by anal. a shape, i.e. a statue, (fig.) style or resemblance; 
    spec. a sampler (&quot;type&quot;), i.e. a model (for imitation) or instance (for 
    warning):--en- (ex-) ample, fashion, figure, form, manner, pattern, print.</p>
    <p>G499. antitupon, an-teet'-oo-pon; neut. of a comp. of G473 and G5179; 
    corresponding [&quot;antitype&quot;], i.e. a representative, counterpart:--(like) 
    figure (whereunto).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The &quot;shadow&quot; or &quot;type&quot; itself had no substance, but rather pointed to a 
  future event that would have substance, the &quot;antitype&quot;. For example, slaying 
  the Passover lamb is the type, the crucifixion of Jesus is the antitype.</p>
  <p><u><strong>The <em>Memorial</em> Seventh-day Sabbath</strong></u></p>
  <p>This is the distinction between the yearly ceremonial sabbaths and the 
  Seventh-day Sabbath: obviously the Seventh-day Sabbath occurs on the last day 
  of every week, but rather than being prophetic in nature, it is commemorative, 
  a memorial to creation, established by God himself as scripture clearly tells 
  us-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
    that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the 
    sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because it is only commemorative, and not a shadow of things to come, the 
  weekly Seventh-day Sabbath is really not part of the discussion in Colossians 
  2:17. When this is understood, the weekly seventh-day Sabbath is clearly not a 
  part of the prophetic sequence of events in the plan of salvation that are 
  portrayed by the yearly ceremonial Sabbaths.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, 
    that we might be justified by faith.<br>
    Gal 3:25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a 
    schoolmaster.<br>
    Gal 3:26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, 
    as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:<br>
    1 Cor 5:8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with 
    the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of 
    sincerity and truth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul is saying that the believing Christian need not keep 
  the <i>ceremonial</i> laws, the shadow sabbaths, because they find fulfillment 
  in faith in Jesus Christ, the true passover lamb. The schoolmaster was the yearly 
  ceremonial sabbaths associated with the Hebrew Temple, which taught the plan 
  of salvation through a coming Messiah, the passover lamb of God. Now that salvation 
  through Jesus of Nazareth is clear to the Gentile church, there is no further 
  need of the schoolmaster (the earthly Temple, its ceremonies and shadow sabbaths) because that lesson has been learned by those with faith. However, 
  nowhere does the Bible indicate that one of the Ten Commandments has been 
  abrogated, or that the disciples or Jesus abandoned the weekly Seventh-day 
  Sabbath for Sunday keeping. Indeed the Bible makes clear, that in the future 
  all believers will keep the true Seventh-day Sabbath-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, 
    shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name 
    remain.<br>
    Isa 66:23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and 
    from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, 
    saith the LORD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God's Sabbath (Saturday) was never rescinded. It is eternal, intended as a 
  constant reminder that we are created beings, responsible to our creator at 
  the end of time. The Seventh-day Sabbath will be kept in perpetuity by God's 
  people because they are obedient and keep the commandments of God. This is 
  particularly true as we near the end of time-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
    commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
