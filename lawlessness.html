<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">Lawlessness In The Temple Of God<br>
  </font><font size="5">2 Thessalonians 2</font></p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:1 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and <i>by</i> our gathering together unto him,<br>
2 Th 2:2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by
spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of
Christ is at hand.<br>
2 Th 2:3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for <i>that day shall
not come,</i> except there come a falling away (apostasia: G646) first,
and that man of sin <b>(lawlessness)</b> be revealed, the son of
perdition;<br>
2 Th 2:4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God. (<a href="pope-throne.html">see
this page</a>)<br>
2 Th 2:5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you
these things?<br>
2 Th 2:6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in
his time.<br>
2 Th 2:7 For the mystery of iniquity <b>(lawlessness)</b> doth already
work: only he who now letteth <i>will let,</i> until he be taken out
of the way.<br>
2 Th 2:8 And then shall that Wicked <b>(lawless one)</b> be revealed,
whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall
destroy with the brightness of his coming:<br>
2 Th 2:9 <i>Even him,</i> whose coming is after the working of Satan
with all power and signs and lying wonders,<br>
2 Th 2:10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness <b>(lawlessness)
    </b>in them that perish; because they received not the love of the
truth, that they might be saved.<br>
2 Th 2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that
they should believe a lie:<br>
2 Th 2:12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but
had pleasure in unrighteousness <b>(lawlessness)</b>.</p>
    <p>Mat 7:22<font color="#ff0000"> Many will say to me in that day,
Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have
cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</font><br>
Mat 7:23 <font color="#ff0000">And then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity </font> <b>(lawlessness)</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u>Sin, Iniquity, Wicked, and Unrighteousness</u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law:
for sin is the transgression of the law.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John gives us this precise definition of sin, which would also
apply to iniquity, wicked, and unrighteousness, as shown in the
parenthesis above. The terms are synonymous (1 John 5:17). So what is
the truth that the lost refuse to receive?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
and thy law is the truth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u>The Temple of God</u></p>
  <p>The word Paul uses for temple in verse 4 is the Greek word naos,
which is G3485 in Strong's dictionary:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>3485. naos, nah-os'; from a prim. naio (to dwell); a fane,
shrine, temple:--shrine, temple. Comp. G2411.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Apostle Paul only uses the word naos in his epistles to refer
to the people of God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 3:16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that
the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?<br>
1 Cor 3:17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the
Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your
own?</p>
    <p>2 Cor 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?
for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell
in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be
my people.</p>
    <p>Eph 2:19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners,
but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;<br>
Eph 2:20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;<br>
Eph 2:21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
holy temple in the Lord:<br>
Eph 2:22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
through the Spirit.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The same association is expressed by Christ in the letter to the
church of Philadelphia in Revelation:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 3:12 <font color="#ff0000">Him that overcometh will I make
a pillar in the temple of my God, ...</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u>Apostasy Enters The Church</u></p>
  <p>Paul also warned in the book of Acts of apostasy arising from
within the church:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the
flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed
the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<br>
Acts 20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous
wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<br>
Acts 20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
things, to draw away disciples after them.<br>
Acts 20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Apostle Peter specifically warned the church of falling into
the apostasy of lawlessness:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Pet 3:17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things
before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
wicked (lawlessness), fall from your own stedfastness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The word Peter uses is G113 in Strong's concordance:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>113. athesmos, ath'-es-mos; from G1 (as a neg. particle) and a
der. of G5087 (in the sense of enacting); lawless, i.e. (by impl.)
criminal:--wicked.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that athesmos has the sense of the negative of enacting,
which is to say lawless, criminal, opposed to law. This is what
characterizes the apostasy of the man of sin in the church, he opposes
God's law.</p>
  <p><u>Son Of Perdition</u></p>
  <p>This phrase is only used twice in scripture, by Paul to describe
the man of sin, and by Jesus in John 17:12 who applied it to Judas.
Like Judas, the man of lawlessness is in the Church. He professes and
appears to be a faithful disciple of Christ, but he is actually a
deceiver, secretly working iniquity, plotting to betray Christ and the
Church.</p>
  <p><u>The Restrainer</u></p>
  <p>The man of lawlessness is inhibited, not able to pursue his
intents, until a restraining entity is removed. Paul is unwilling to
openly identify this restrainer, but he mentions that the Thessalonians
already knew who it was (vs. 5-7). The testimony of the <a
 href="fathers-on-antichrist.html">early church fathers</a> is that the
restrainer was the pagan Roman Empire, and after its fall, the man of
sin, the antichrist, would flourish such that he could then be
identified.</p>
  <p>At this point, we can say with certainty that the falling away
that Paul describes in 2 Thess 2:3 is apostasy entering into the
professing Christian Church (naos), and that this apostasy is promoted
by the man of sin who exalts himself above God by subtly deceiving the
church into transgressing the law of God. This was well understood by
Protestants of a century ago:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... There, in that exalted cathedral position, and claiming to
represent God, the man of sin was to act and abide as the pretended
vicar, but real antagonist, of Christ, undermining His authority,
abolishing His laws, and oppressing His people. Observe the words, "<i>who
opposeth" </i>It is possible effectually to oppose another without
being his <i>avowed </i>antagonist; so the <i> professions </i>of
the predicted power might be friendly, while his <i> actions </i>would
be those of an opponent of the gospel of Christ. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have said that the principles which were
ultimately to produce the man of sin had already begun to operate in
Paul's own day. His words are, "The mystery of iniquity <i>doth
already work"</i>; and these principles would continue to work until
the full development of the apostasy, and its final destruction at the
second advent: that is, <i>throughout the eighteen Christian
centuries. </i>The sphere of their operation therefore cannot be the
Jewish temple, which was destroyed in the first century, but must needs
be the professing Christian Church.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An important point in the prophecy is the
existence in apostolic times of a certain <i>restraining power, </i>withholding
while it lasted the manifestation of the man of sin. Paul, for good
reasons, speaks of it in guarded language, as "he who <span
 class="gstxt_hlt">letteth," </span>or "that which hinders." What it
was Paul knew, and the Thessalonians knew from him: "Remember ye not,
that, when I was yet with you, I told you ? "The early Church—from whom
    <i>alone </i>we can learn what Paul told them by word of mouth,
but refrained from committing to writing—has left it on record that the
Apostle had told them that this hindering power was <i>the dominion of
the Roman Caesars ; </i>that while <i> they </i>continued to reign
at Rome, the development of the predicted power of evil was impossible.
Hence it would seem that ROME would be the seat of the man of sin.
During the continuance of the Roman empire there was no opportunity for
him to rise; he would only be manifested on its fall. While the Caesars
reigned he could not appear, but when they passed away he would succeed
them.</p>
    <p class="gtxt_body">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice particularly that,
just as the expression, "he that <span class="gstxt_hlt">letteth," </span>comprehends
    <i>the line or succession of the Caesars, </i>so the expression,
"he that<span class="gtxt_body"> sitteth," may well comprehend an
analogous <i>line or succession </i>of rulers. Both expressions refer
to dynasties, and not to individuals.</span></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>This man of lawlessness is also described by the prophet Daniel as
the little horn:</p>
  <p><u>Changing The Law of God</u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:25 And he (the little horn) shall speak great words
against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High,
and think <u>to change times and laws</u>: and they shall be given
into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Apostle Paul and Daniel the prophet have given us enough
information to look back on the history of the Christian Church and
precisely identify the apostasy that reveals the man of lawlessness. We
need only to look for any examples of the law of God, the Ten
Commandments, being changed by the church that professes to be
Christian. For example, has the church at some point decreed a change
in the commandment prohibiting coveting? Not that I am aware of. How
about the commandment prohibiting bearing false witness? Has the church
changed it? Again, no. Neither has the church decreed a change in the
commandments regarding stealing, adultery, killing, or honoring your
father and mother. These commandments of God all involve a horizontal
relationship between people, and to my knowledge they stand as written,
unchanged.</p>
  <p>The remaining commandments are vertical in nature, dealing with
mankind's relationship to God. Here we find what we are looking for.
The commandment of God regarding the seventh day Sabbath has been
changed. <br>
From the <a
 href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a3.htm">
  <i> Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>:</a></p>
  <blockquote> <span class="text">
    <p><b>Sunday - fulfillment of the sabbath</b> </p>
    <p><b>2175</b> Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath
which it follows chronologically every week; for Christians its
ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's
Passover, Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and
announces man's eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared
for the mystery of Christ, and what was done there prefigured some
aspects of Christ:<sup>107</sup> </p>
    <dl>
      <dd><span class="text1"><font size="2">Those who lived according
to the old order of things have come to a new hope, no longer keeping
the sabbath, but the Lord's Day, in which our life is blessed by him
and by his death.<sup>108</sup> </font></span></dd>
    </dl>
    </span> </blockquote>
  <p>The commandment of God regarding the Sabbath is special because it
explains who God is, and how and why we are to worship Him. This has
made it the primary target of Satan and the man of lawlessness.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
is within thy gates:<br>
Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Revelation also explains why God is worthy of worship:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 4:10 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that
sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
cast their crowns before the throne, saying,<br>
Rev 4:11 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and
power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are
and were created.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By introducing Sunday keeping as a replacement for the seventh day
Sabbath, the law of God has been subtly subverted, such that people are
deceived by the professing Christian church into thinking they are
honoring God, while they are actually in transgression of God's law.</p>
  <p>Next, we find that the commandment prohibiting bowing down to <i>any</i>
statues or images has also been changed. <br>
From the <a
 href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c1a1.htm#IV">
  <i> Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>:</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="text"><b>1161 </b>All the signs in the liturgical
celebrations are related to Christ: as are sacred images of the holy
Mother of God and of the saints as well. They truly signify Christ, who
is glorified in them. They make manifest the "cloud of witnesses" who
continue to participate in the salvation of the world and to whom we
are united, above all in sacramental celebrations. Through their icons,
it is man "in the image of God," finally transfigured "into his
likeness," who is revealed to our faith. So too are the angels, who
also are recapitulated in Christ: </span></p>
    <dl>
      <dd><font size="2">Following the divinely inspired teaching of
our holy Fathers and the tradition of the Catholic Church (for we know
that this tradition comes from the Holy Spirit who dwells in her) we
rightly define with full certainty and correctness that, like the
figure of the precious and life-giving cross, venerable and holy images
of our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ, our inviolate Lady, the
holy Mother of God, and the venerated angels, all the saints and the
just, whether painted or made of mosaic or another suitable material,
are to be exhibited in the holy churches of God, on sacred vessels and
vestments, walls and panels, in houses and on streets. <sup>31</sup></font></dd>
    </dl>
    <blockquote><font size="2"></font><span class="text1"><font size="2">31
Council of Nicaea II: DS 600.</font></span></blockquote>
    <p><b>2131</b> Basing itself on the mystery of the incarnate Word,
the seventh ecumenical council at Nicaea (787) justified against the
iconoclasts the veneration of icons - of Christ, but also of the Mother
of God, the angels, and all the saints. By becoming incarnate, the Son
of God introduced a new "economy" of images. </p>
    <p><b>2132</b> The Christian veneration of images is not contrary
to the first commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honor
rendered to an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever venerates
an image venerates the person portrayed in it."<sup>70</sup> The honor
paid to sacred images is a "respectful veneration," not the adoration
due to God alone: </p>
    <dl>
      <dd><font size="2">Religious worship is not directed to images in
themselves, considered as mere things, but under their distinctive
aspect as images leading us on to God incarnate. The movement toward
the image does not terminate in it as image, but tends toward that
whose image it is.<sup>71</sup> </font></dd>
    </dl>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The commandment of God strongly prohibits what the Catholic Church
expressly permits. Idolatry that God condemns becomes sacred image
veneration in Catholicism. The most egregious example of this idolatry
is <a href="faustina.html">Divine Mercy Sunday.</a></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br>
Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
hate me;<br>
Exo 20:6 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
keep my commandments.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note this again, from Paul:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 6:16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?
for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell
in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be
my people.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, Revelation tells us that some will not repent and give up
their useless impotent idols:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 9:20 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these
plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should
not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and
stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Apostle Paul also makes the following observation:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:16 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants
to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto
death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As seen above, the Catholic Church freely admits these Traditions
of Sunday keeping and venerating statues and images involve <i>changing</i>
one of the 10 commandments of God. These changes, in fact, contradict
and violate God's commandments: they are sin. Paul and Daniel clearly
prophesied a subtle imposter would be leading the professing Christian
Church into apostasy (falling away), deceiving them into transgressing
God's law while claiming to represent and honor God. However, by
thinking to change God's law the man of sin is exalting himself above
God, and that violates the first commandment:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>
  </blockquote>

Mark Of The Beast In Daniel 8 - 12</a></b></p>
