        276-282) which on the reverse depicts the pagan sun god driving a 
        chariot drawn by four horses (Sol in Quadriga). The inscription reads 
        SOLI INVICTO - The Invincible Sun.]
        <p>At right is a similar mosaic found in the Vatican grottoes under St.

        depicts Christ as the sun-god Helios / Sol riding in his chariot, and is 
        dated to the 3rd century A.D. The two left horses were destroyed when 
        the hole was made to enter the tomb. Other mosaics in this Christian 
        tomb depicted Jonah and the whale, the good shepherd carrying a lamb, 
        and fishermen. This blending of paganism with Christianity is

    <p>... The Akkadian Ishtar is also, to a greater extent, an astral deity, 
    associated with the planet Venus: with Shamash, sun god, and Sin, moon god, 
    she forms a secondary astral triad. In this manifestation her symbol is a 
    star with 6, 8, or 16 rays within a circle. ...</p>

    <hr>
    <p><b>The Star of Ishtar</b></p>
    <p>Because some astronomical objects move through the sky in repeated and 
    known intervals of time, the behavior of the celestial gods associated with 
    them can be symbolized numerically. Ishtar, as the planet Venus, perhaps was 
    handled this way in the eight-pointed star that usually stands for her on 
    Babylonian boundary stones.</p>
    <p>References to Venus as early as 3000 BC are known from evidence at Uruk, 
    an important early Sumerian city in southern Iraq. One clay tablet found at 
    the site says &quot;star Inanna,&quot; and another contains symbols for the words 
    &quot;star, setting sun, Inanna.&quot; Inanna is Venus, known later as Ishtar, and the 
    Uruk tablets specify her celestial identity with the symbol for &quot;star&quot;: an 
    eight-pointed star.</p>

      square of St. John Lateran (shown at left) is the largest in existence. 
      Originally carved during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmoses III, it stood in 
      the Temple of Amon in Thebes (Karnak), but was removed to Rome by emperor 
      Constantius (A.D. 317-361), and placed in the Circus Maximus. In 1587 Pope 
      Sixtus V unearthed the fallen, broken and long forgotten obelisk and had 
      it repaired and placed in the Piazza S. Giovanni in Laterano. 
      Interestingly enough, it is possible that Moses saw this very obelisk when 
      he was in Egypt. Now this obelisk, meant to honor the sun god, stands 
      beside what Catholics call the supreme <a href="dragon.html#Lateran">

  <hr>
  <p>The pagan association of the obelisk was something well understood by the 
  church. The Jesuit scholar, Athanasius Kircher in his book <em>Obeliscus 
  Pamphilius</em>, published in 1650, gives an account of the ancient views of 
  the obelisk as the <em>digitus solis</em>, or &quot;finger of the sun&quot;.</p>
  <p>Pope Sixtus V (1585 - 1590) had the Egyptian obelisks erected all over 
  Rome, as Counter-Reformation monuments.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The word matstsebah in Hebrew means standing images or obelisk and it can 
  be found in many places of the Bible. Here is Strong's definition of the 
  Hebrew word matstsebah-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>H4676.</b> matstsebah, mats-tsay-baw'; fem. (causat.) part. of H5324; 
    something stationed, i.e. a column or (memorial stone); by anal. an 
    idol:--garrison, (standing) image, pillar.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the following verses matstsebah has been translated as image(s)-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do 
    after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break 
    down their images.</p>
    <p>Exo 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut 
    down their groves:</p>
    <p>Lev 26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up 
    a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, 
    to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
    <p>Deu 7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, 
    and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their 
    graven images with fire.</p>
    <p>Deu 12:3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, 
    and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of 
    their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.</p>
    <p>1 Ki 14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, 
    on every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>
    <p>2 Ki 3:2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his 
    father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his 
    father had made.</p>
    <p>2 Ki 10:26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, 
    and burned them.</p>
    <p>2 Ki 10:27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the 
    house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.</p>
    <p>2 Chr 14:3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high 
    places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
    <p>2 Chr 31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present 
    went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut 
    down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all 
    Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly 
    destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to 
    his possession, into their own cities.</p>
    <p>Jer 43:13 He shall break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the 
    land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn 
    with fire.</p>
    <p>Micah 5:13 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images 
    out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine 
    hands.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Another Hebrew word is also used for &quot;sun images&quot; or obelisks, the word 
  chamman. Again, here is the Strong's definition-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>H2553.</b> chamman, kham-mawn'; from H2535; a sun-pillar:--idol, 
    image.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Chamman is also translated as simply image(s) in the King James:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 17:8 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, 
    neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, 
    or the images.</p>
    <p>Isa 27:9 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and 
    this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of 
    the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images 
    shall not stand up.</p>
    <p>2 Chr 34:4 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and 
    the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and 
    the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust 
    of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto 
    them.</p>

  celebrating Palm Sunday in St. Peter's square on April 16th, 2000, with a 
  &quot;grove&quot; of potted palms and hundred-year-old olive trees placed around the 
  standing solar pillar (matstsebah) or obelisk, in the center of the Vatican's 
  large pagan solar wheel symbolizing Baal and Ishtar.</p>

  <p align="left">It is supposedly a statue of Peter enthroned. Notice the sun 
  wheel above his head? This statue is thought by some to actually be a pagan 
  statue of Jupiter, removed from the Pantheon in Rome (a pagan temple), moved 
  into St. Peter's and renamed Peter. The extended right foot has been nearly 
  worn away from the many pilgrims who kiss it in homage. Note also that the 
  pattern on the wall behind the statue utilizes the symbol of Baal / Shamash!</p>
  <p align="left">According to the Catholic Encyclopedia online article
  <span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3"><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12294b.htm"><i>Portraits of 
  the Apostles</i>:</a></font></span></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="left">The famous bronze statue of St. Peter in the basilica of this 
  Apostle in Rome is by some regarded as a work of the fifth or sixth century, 
  by others as pertaining to the thirteenth. The latter date is adopted by Kraus 
  and Kaufmann among others; Lowrie, however, maintains that &quot;no statue of the Renaissance can be 
  compared with this for genuine understanding of the classic dress&quot;, and, 
  therefore, this writer holds for the more ancient date. The marble statue of 
  St. Peter taken from the old basilica, now in the crypt of the Vatican, was 
  originally, in all probability, an ancient consular statue which was 
  transformed into a representation of the Prince of Apostles.</p>

      <p align="left">Here you see a photo looking up into the dome of St. 
      Peter's. Notice the very obvious 16 ray sun wheel. Indeed the light from 
      the sun streams into the center hub of the dome making a genuine sun-lit 
      sunburst image at the center of the wheel.</p>
      <p align="left">As you can see from the Bible verses quoted above, these 
      symbols were associated with sun worship, which is strongly condemned in 
      scripture. So why are they so prevalent in the Roman Catholic Church, if 
      they are associated with paganism and apostasy?</td>
