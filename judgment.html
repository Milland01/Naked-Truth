    Dan 7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: <u>thousand

  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">How will evidence be 
  given in the Judgment of the professed Saints?</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Dan 7:10 ... the judgment was set, 
    and the books were opened.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Mal 3:16 Then they that feared the 
    LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a 
    book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, 
    and that thought upon his name.<br>

    of life.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: The record books of heaven 
  on the professed saints will be opened in evidence before the court: the 
  Lamb's book of life, and the book of remembrance of their deeds in service to 
  the Lord, faithfully recorded by witnessing angels. <u>The book with 7 seals 
  in Revelation chapters 5 thru 8 is the Lamb's book of life (Phil. 4:3, Rev. 
  3:5, 13:8, 17:8, 20:12,15, 21:27, 22:19)</u>. It is the 
  <a href="covenant-seal.html#Last Will">last will and 
  testament of Jesus Christ</a> (Heb. 9:14-17), the new covenant, that lists those 
  who will inherit eternal life and the kingdom of God. When the reading of the 
  Lamb's book of life ends, probation for humanity has come to a close, as all 
  those who inherit have been identified.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">God does not need to keep books for 
  Himself, but rather they are kept for others who do not have His omniscience. 
  These books are available to the heavenly hosts in the court for their <i>
  investigation</i>, that they may know that God is just. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">What events follow the 
  beginning of the Investigative Judgment of the professed Saints?</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Dan 7:10 ... the judgment was set, 
    and the books were opened.<br>
    Dan 7:11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the 
    horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, 
    and given to the burning flame.<br>
    Dan 7:12 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken 
    away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.<br>
    Dan 7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man 
    came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they 
    brought him near before him.<br>
    Dan 7:14 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that 
    all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an 
    everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which 
    shall not be destroyed.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">2 Th 2:8 And then shall that 
    Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his 
    mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: In Daniel 7 the destruction 
  of the little horn power comes after the opening of the books for the 
  judgment of the Saints. So the books are opened for investigation, and 
  judgment begins before the Second Advent, which is when the little horn / 
  antichrist will be consumed. This judgment then is rightly called a <i>
  Pre-advent Investigative Judgment</i>. The kingdom parable of the wedding of 
  the King's Son in Matt 22:1-13 illustrates this clearly when the King examines 
  the wedding guests for the garment that He provided. Those not wearing the 
  wedding garment are not permitted to attend the wedding supper, and are cast 
  into outer darkness instead. This parable refers to the wedding supper of the 
  Lamb, and the garment is Christ's righteousness, which is provided to those 
  with faith. This examination, or judgment for fitness to attend the wedding 
  supper, precedes the second coming, which is when the goats will be separated 
  from the sheep.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">Is there a specific day 
  set for the revelation of God's judgment?</font></b></p>

    appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by 
    that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Rom 2:5 But after thy hardness and 
    impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath 
    and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Rom 2:16 In the day when God shall 
    judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: A day has indeed been 
  appointed for the judgment of God to be revealed.</font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: At the second coming of

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: Everyone's fate will have 
  been decided by the court of heaven <i>before</i> the second coming of Jesus, and 
  nothing will change the verdict after the  Pre-advent Investigative Judgment of the Saints 
  has concluded (the close of probation). 
  While only the books regarding the Saints of God have been examined in the 
  Pre-advent Investigative Judgment, the wicked stand condemned by not having 
  sought the defense of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, so their sins are not 
  covered by Christ's righteousness, and they must bear responsibility for their 
  own sins.</font></p>

    Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the

    John 5:29 <font color="#FF0000">And shall come forth; they that have done 
    good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the

    received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived 
    and reigned with Christ a thousand years.<br>
    Rev 20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years 
    were finished. This is the first resurrection.<br>
    Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: During the millennium the 
  Saints will judge the wicked. The righteous dead will be resurrected at the 
  beginning of the thousand years to participate in this judgment of the wicked, 
  but the wicked will not be resurrected until after the millennium and the 
  examination of the evidence against the wicked has been completed. </font></p>

    book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of 
    those things which were written in the books, according to their works.<br>
    Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell 
    delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man

  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: The Saints during the 
  millennium will have access to the heavenly books on the wicked and know why 
  they are all lost. The wicked will not be found in the Lamb's book of life, 
  but their wicked works will appear in the Book of Iniquity. At the conclusion 
  of the millennium, the judgment of God the Father will be shown to have been 
  fair and just, and so it will be affirmed by the Saints. All that will remain 
  to be done is to execute (carry out) the judgment (sentence) of the court upon 
  the wicked. This is the Executive judgment.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial Narrow" size="4">What happens at the 
  conclusion of the Investigative Judgment of the wicked by the Saints?</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Rev 20:7 And when the thousand 
    years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,<br>
    Rev 20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four 
    quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the 
    number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<br>
    Rev 20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the 
    camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God 
    out of heaven, and devoured them.<br>
    Rev 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire 
    and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be 
    tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>
    Rev 20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose 
    face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for 
    them.<br>
    Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the 
    books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: 
    and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the 
    books, according to their works.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial Narrow">Answer: At the end of the 1000 
  years, the wicked will all be resurrected, and will be persuaded by Satan to 
  attack the New Jerusalem (camp of the saints), to take it by force, so that 
  they might gain access to the tree of life and thereby live forever. Instead, 
  they will face Executive Judgment before the great white throne of Jesus 
  Christ.</font></p>
