<blockquote>
  <p>On December 12th, 1997, <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><strong><a
  href="http://www.cwnews.com/"> Catholic World News </a></strong>reported that
  the town of Bryan, Ohio had permitted an avowed atheist, Jerald Lasky, to
  protest the religious use of governmental property by adding a sunburst image
  to a Christmas nativity scene. The sunburst was to honor the winter solstice
  occuring on December 21st, a traditional pagan festival day.</p>
  <p>I suppose we are to be shocked and appalled that pagan symbols should be
  allowed to intrude into Christian celebrations?
  <p>Below is a nativity scene by Pinturicchio and his assistants from 1492-94,
  in the Borgia apartments in the Vatican. There are probably hundreds of
  similar depictions of the nativity scene I could have selected, as this
  particular one is not unique in any respect.</p>

    </tr>
  </table>
  <p></center>Note that there are no less than five pagan sun images in this
  painting! One behind the head of the infant Jesus, another two behind the
  heads of Mary and Joseph and another two behind the heads of two angels. Had
  Mr. Lasky secretly placed his pagan sunburst behind the head of the infant
  Jesus, or either of this parents, most Catholics, indeed most Christians,
  would have thought nothing of seeing such a sight. However, because this
  sunburst is openly declared pagan and atheistic we are to be outraged, but
  baptized sanitized sun images behind the heads of &quot;holy&quot; people are
  acceptable?
  <p>Just how did we come to celebrate the birth of Christ on December 25th
  anyway? Do we know for a fact that this was the date of Christ's birth? Is the
  winter solstice of December 21st related in any way to Christmas? Just what is
  the winter solstice anyway?
  <p>For the answers see <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <strong><a
