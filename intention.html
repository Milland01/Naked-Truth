    <p>[...] I have heard about some priests that practice satanic rituals. Now, 
    maybe these are rumors, but what if it were true? Could a priest who 
    worships Satan still dispense the sacraments? Personally, I feel that if I 
    were dying and the only priest around was an evil man with no love for God, 
    I would not want to receive last rites from him. </p>

    <p align="left"><font size="3">Dear Lisa, As long as any priest, even the 
    sinful and unworthy priest, as long as he wants to effect and do what his 
    Catholic Church desires to be done, his work is efficacious and grace flows 
    from God thru him to the faithful. E.g. A sinful priest baptizes a baby. He 
    wants to confer the Sacrament, to do what the Church wants done, and it 
    always happens. The baby is baptized. Now, if a sinful priest loses his 
    faith and doesn't want to do what the Church intends, then nothing happens, 
    no grace is given. He puts up an obstacle. This of course is extremely rare.

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="5">T</font>HIS is one of the most curious 
  and dreadful doctrines ever proclaimed by human lips or written by the pen of 
  man. In the seventh session of the Council of Trent, thirteen canons were 
  enacted upon the sacraments generally, cursing those who shall say, that the 
  sacraments of the new law were not appointed by the Saviour; that they do not 
  differ unless in externals from the sacraments of the ancient law; that the 
  sacraments of the new law are not necessary to salvation; and pronouncing 
  curses upon all persons guilty of various crimes against the sacraments. Among 
  these maledictions is the following:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;IF ONE SHALL SAY, THAT IN MINISTERS, WHILST THEY COMPLETE 
  AND CONFER THE SACRAMENTS, THERE IS NOT REQUIRED THE <i>INTENTION</i>, AT 
  LEAST OF DOING WHAT THE CHURCH DOES, LET HIM BE ACCURSED.&quot;*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This canon sows uncertainty broadcast over the Catholics of 
  the world. Suppose that the priest who baptizes a child did not intend to &quot;do 
  as the Church does,&quot; in granting the sacrament, then the child is not 
  baptized, and no faith subsequently received, no works performed in the future 
  can remove that original defect; according to the Catholic theory that man is 
  not a Christian, and cannot be saved. Suppose that when that man come to be 
  married, the same priest performs the ceremony with the usual rites, but he 
  does not intend to marry the couple, then in follows, that the sacrament of 
  marriage has never been administered to this</p>

  Sacraments in General - Canon 11.</b></a>]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 358]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">man and his wife, that their wedded relations 
  are stained with the infamy of fornication, and that their children are 
  branded before God with the crime of illegitimacy. And suppose again, that 
  this priest in consecrating the host does not intend to consecrate it, it 
  follows, according to the papal theory, that it is not the real body and blood 
  of Jesus, that it is only bread; and, therefore, when the people worship what 
  they regard as the very Son of Mary, they are only adoring a piece of paste, 
  they are guilty of idolatry. And suppose this priest in the confessional 
  solemnly absolves a penitent man from his sins, but does not intend to release 
  him from his guilt, on the Roman theory, the poor supplicant has no pardon, he 
  rejoices in a delusion, he is the victim of sacerdotal imposition. And suppose 
  that this priest baptizes an infant boy without the intention of doing it, and 
  as a consequence the child is not a Christian, and can never perform with true 
  validity any act of a Christian; that in time the priest becomes a bishop, and 
  the babe becomes a man, and a candidate for the service of the altar; that 
  this old friend ordains him deacon and priest, but &quot;does not intend to do as 
  the Church does,&quot; in either case, it follows that all the children he baptizes 
  are heathens outside of Church, and with no title to heaven; that all his 
  absolutions are null, and his penitents are still in their sins; that all his 
  marriages are invalid, the parties being yet before God destitute of wedded 
  sanctions; and that all his masses are impositions, the man himself being 
  neither a priest nor a Christian; and hence all the people that worshipped the 
  hosts which he consecrated were guilty of idolatry on every occasion in which 
  they were in the church when he celebrated mass. Now let us suppose farther, 
  that this young man becomes pope in the process of time, and he sits in 
  Peter's chair for many years. He is not a Christian, he is not a priest, he 
  can perform no religious act because he was never baptized; then all his 
  masses are senseless mummeries, all his pontifical blessings are impositions; 
  he has no right to send the Pallium to any bishop, so that the hundreds of 
  bishops who have been consecrated during his long reign are destitute of 
  authority to perform one episcopal act; all the priests and deacons they have 
  ordained are laymen still, all the children they have baptized are yet in 
  heathenism; all their absolutions are mockeries,</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 359]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">and all their masses are but idolatries. Since 
  the heavens were stretched over the earth, since this globe's covering of 
  waters was gathered up into seas, nothing so monstrous as this doctrine was 
  ever invented. No Catholic, without omniscient knowledge of the priest's 
  intention, can possibly tell whether he was baptized, absolved, married, 
  ordained; or whether in the mass he was idolatrously worshipping unchanged 
  bread, or reverently adoring the veritable God-man made out of flour. In this 
  way the whole earthly and everlasting religious privileges of the Catholic 
  depend, not on Christ, not the man's own deeds or his priest's, but on the <i>
  intentions </i>of a minister whose purposes he has no possible way of 
  learning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And while Catholic priests have, no doubt, the ordinary 
  honesty of motive common to men in general; yet, as Protestant communities 
  have the deceitful, so unquestionably the Romish Church has the insincere and 
  hypocritical, who, out of malice, or to gratify some caprice, or some 
  sceptical opinion about the power of their sacraments, occasionally or 
  frequently have no intention to &quot;do as the Church does,&quot; and their masses, 
  absolutions and other rites are all counterfeits.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anthony Gavin, a Catholic priest of Saragossa, describes the 
  confession of a brother priest on his deathbed, whose name he conceals, and 
  who says: &quot;The necessary <i>intention</i> of a priest in the administration of 
  baptism and consecration (of the wafer) without which the sacraments are of no 
  effect, I confess I had it not on several occasions, as you may see in the 
  parish books; and observe that the baptism was invalid of every person whose 
  name is there marked with a star, for in such cases I had no intention. And 
  for this I can give no other reason than my malice and wickedness. Many of 
  them are dead, for which I am heartily sorry. As for the times I have 
  consecrated (the wafer) without intention we must leave it to God's mercy, for 
  the wrong done by it to the souls of my parishoners, and those in purgatory 
  cannot be helped.&quot;* This disclosure is one of the most natural in the world. 
  Unless Romish priests are made of different materials than other men, than the 
  elements of which the Saviour's twelve apostles were composed, there must be 
  such characters as this dying priest, whose</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>* &quot;Master Key to Popery,&quot; p. 36., Cincinnati. 1833.</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[p. 360]</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">intention was not always &quot;to do as the Church 
  does&quot; in making sacraments. Gavin, on examining the parish books, found one 
  hundred and fifty-two names marked with a star, and of the persons enrolled in 
  this ill-starred register eighty six were dead. Gavin was greatly troubled 
  about these persons, knowing that it is the decided opinion of the Church that 
  &quot;The <i>intention</i> of the priest is absolutely necessary to the validity of 
  a sacrament, <i>without which there is no sacrament at all.&quot; </i>By the advice 
  of his brother priests he communicated the case to the bishop, who summoned 
  the persons still living, who through the absence of intention in the defunct 
  priest, <i>were not baptized when they passed through all the forms of 
  baptism, </i>and bringing them into his own chamber separately, he baptized 
  them; enjoining the strictest secrecy under the heaviest penalties upon each.*</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>No Certainty about Salvation 
  in the Catholic Church.</i></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Cardinal Bellarmine,
  <font face="Times New Roman">† &quot;It is not possible for any one to be sure with 
  the certainty of faith that he has received a true sacrament, as a sacrament 
  cannot be celebrated without the intention of the minister, and <i>no one can 
  see the intention of another.&quot; </i>In the Romish Church, by the testimony of 
  Bellarmine, and the Council of Trent, no one can tell whether he has ever 
  received a true sacrament; nor has he any certainty whether he is not going 
  headlong to the pit when he may have observed all the rites of the Church; and 
  when he may have the assurance of all its clergy that he is going straight to 
  heaven. There is ground here for dreadful uncertainty and apprehension.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Objection 1.</b> It seems that the 
    minister's intention is not required for the validity of a sacrament. For 
    the minister of a sacrament works instrumentally. But the perfection of an 
    action does not depend on the intention of the instrument, but on that of

    instrument has no intention regarding the effect; but instead of the 
    intention there is the motion whereby it is moved by the principal agent. 
    But an animate instrument, such as a minister, is not only moved, but in a 
    sense moves itself, in so far as by his will he moves his bodily members to 
    act. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Consequently, his intention is
