  The Elijah Message <br>
  From Scripture</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Daniel 2</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Dan 2:1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar 
  Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his 
  sleep brake from him.<br>
  Dan 2:2 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, 
  and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So they 
  came and stood before the king.</p>
  <p>Dan 2:10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a 
  man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore there is no 
  king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, 
  or Chaldean.<br>
  Dan 2:11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none 
  other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not 
  with flesh.</p>
  <p>Dan 2:19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then 
  Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Main Point in Daniel 2.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar could not remember the dream that troubled him and none 
    of the king's Babylonian advisors could tell him the dream or the 
    interpretation. When Daniel was able to reveal the dream and its 
    interpretation, it uniquely identified him as a servant of God whom God 
    had given the true understanding of the prophecy.</li>
  </ul>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Daniel 3</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was 
    threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the 
    plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>
    <p>Dan 3:6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be 
    cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
    </blockquote>
  <p><b>Main Points in Daniel 3.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, was not happy to know his empire was 
    prophesied to fall to an inferior kingdom. He thought that by making his statue man 
    all of gold, that he could change the prophetic interpretation of successive 
    kingdoms as given by Daniel, in other words, he thought to change <u>the 
    prophetic times of God</u>, so that his Babylon would not fall.</li>
    <li>Nebuchadnezzar then commanded that everyone in the kingdom bow down to 
    worship his all-gold statue, which directly contradicted <u>the law of God.</u> 
    This was enforced under the penalty of a death decree for non-compliance.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Daniel 7</font></b></p>
    <p>Dan 7:8 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them 
    another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked 
    up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn <i>were</i> eyes like the eyes of 
    man, and a mouth speaking great things.<br>
    Dan 7:9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days 
    did sit, whose garment <i>was</i> white as snow, and the hair of his head 
    like the pure wool: his throne <i>was like</i> the fiery flame, <i>and</i> 
    his wheels <i>as</i> burning fire.<br>
    Dan 7:10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand 
    thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood 
    before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p>
    <p>Dan 7:25 And he shall speak <i>great</i> words against the most High, and 
    shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to <u>change times and 
    laws</u>: and they shall be given into his hand until <a href="times.html">a time and times and the 
    dividing of time</a>.<br>
    Dan 7:26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, 
    to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Main Points in Daniel 7.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The little horn power arises after the disintegration of the Roman Empire, 
    and has dominion for 1260 years (3 1/2 times), from 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D.</li>
    <li>The little horn power thinks to change two things, the prophetic times, 
    and laws, of the most High, in a manner similar to Nebuchadnezzar.</li>
    <li>After the 1260 years, the judgment begins in heaven.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="center">
  <b><font size="5">Daniel 8</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:11 Yea, he magnified <i>himself</i> even to the prince of the host, 
    and by him the daily <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike> (<u>perpetual <i>covenant,</i> 
    Isa 24:5, Exo. 31:16, the Sabbath</u>) 
    was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.<br>
    Dan 8:12 And an host was given <i>him</i> against the daily <strike><i>
    sacrifice</i></strike> (perpetual <i>covenant</i>) by reason of transgression, and 
    it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.<br>
    Dan 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that 
    certain <i>saint</i> which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>
    concerning</i> the daily <i> <strike>sacrifice</strike> </i>(perpetual <i>
    covenant</i>), and the 
    <a href="abomination-of-desolation.html">transgression of desolation</a>, to give both the 
    <a href="temple.html">sanctuary</a> and the host to be 
    trodden under foot?<br>
    Dan 8:14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then 
    shall the sanctuary be cleansed.<br>
    Dan 8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, 
    and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the 
    appearance of a man.<br>
    Dan 8:16 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, 
    and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.<br>
    Dan 8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, 
    and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at 
    the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
    <p>Dan 8:26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is 
    true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Main Points in Daniel 8.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The little horn transgresses the truth (God's law, Psa. 119:142) by thinking to change 
    the perpetual covenant, the Sabbath commandment, to Sunday. This is the 
    &quot;laws&quot; referred to in Daniel 7:25.</li>
    <li>The little horn thinks to change the 
    <a href="antichrist.html">prophetic times</a> of God, and thereby obscure 
    the genuine meaning of prophecy, in particular the beginning of
    <a href="judgment.html">judgment</a> in the heavenly 
    sanctuary. This is the &quot;times&quot; referred to in Daniel 7:25.</li>
    <li>Daniel was instructed by the angel Gabriel (v. 16)</li>
    <li>The vision of the 2300 days was shut up, not to be understood just like 
    Nebuchadnezzar's dream, until it was revealed by God's servants with 
    the gift of prophecy, at the time of the end (Dan 12:4, 9).</li>
    <li>The time of&nbsp; the end begins at 
    the conclusion of the <a href="dan927.html">1260 years</a> of persecution and dominion of the little 
    horn, which was 1798 A.D. (Daniel 11:33-35). (See also Dan 8:17, 11:40, Dan. 
    12:4, 9.) </li>
    <li>
    The Advent movement of the late 1840's taught that the 2300 day/year prophecy extends from 457 B.C. to 1844 A.D., and indicates 
    the beginning of judgment in heaven exactly as described in Daniel 7:9-10, 
    26, after the conclusion 
    of the 1260 years.</li>
    <li>
    Understanding <a href="KeyofDavid.html">judgment and the Hebrew sanctuary</a> 
    automatically led the Adventists to realize the standard for the judgment at 
    the time of the end was the Ten Commandments <u>as given on mount Sinai</u> 
    on tables of stone kept in the ark of the covenant, in the most holy 
    apartment of the sanctuary. </li>
    <li>
    Thus, the two points that the little horn thought to change 
    and obscure, the times and laws of the most High, were brought to light and 
    corrected by the unsealing of the 2300 day/year prophecy at the time of the 
    end (Daniel 12:9).</li>

  <ul>
    <li>The holy covenant (the sabbath) and the sanctuary are paired as they 
    were in Daniel 8, again repeating and enlarging on times and laws in Daniel 
    7:25. This time though, Daniel refers to the abomination that maketh 
    desolate.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
  Because they have the oil of the Holy Spirit in their vessels, the true people 
  of God are the wise virgins (Matt 25:1-13) that understand Daniel at the time 
  of the end.</li>
    <li>
  The wise of verse 10 will understand the previously sealed sanctuary/seventh 
  day Sabbath message of verse 11, and will proclaim that judgment is underway 
  in heaven, and to keep God's seventh day Sabbath commandment in order to avoid 
  the mark of the beast (see Rev 14:7-12). This message is distinctive of the 
  true church, and will turn many to righteousness. The Hebrew word for 
  righteousness in verse 3 is the same word translated &quot;cleansed&quot; in Daniel 
  8:14, H6663. tsadaq.</li>

  <p><b>Main Points in Revelation 10.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    John is instructed by a <i>mighty</i> angel, which is to say 
    a mighty messenger. By the description, this can only be Jesus. </li>
    <li>
    In His hand is a little open book. That it is now open 
    implies it <i>was</i> closed. This refers to Daniel 8 and the 2300 day 
    prophecy.</li>
    <li>
    &quot;Time no longer&quot; indicates the 2300 days have expired (see Dan. 8:17, 26), 
    the cleansing of the sanctuary has begun, and the prophecy is now to be 
    correctly understood and proclaimed (see Dan:12:4, 9). This refers to 1844 
    and the advent movement, who &quot;must prophesy again&quot;.</li>
    <li>
    Note the reference to the creator and the Sabbath commandment in verse 6 
    (and that the sanctuary is to be studied in Rev. 11:1-2).</li>

    <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Revelation 12</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:4 ... and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be 
    delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</p>
    <p>Rev 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that 
    she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished 
    for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.<br>
    Rev 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the 
    woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.<br>
    Rev 12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, 
    and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<br>
    Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with 
    the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have <u>the 
    testimony of Jesus Christ.</u></p>

    prophecy.</u></p>

    fellowservant, and of thy brethren <u>the prophets</u>, and of them which

  <ul>
    <li>The dragon attempted to kill the infant Jesus through the civil 
    government, Herod the Great.</li>
    <li>The true church is depicted as being in the wilderness during the 1260 
    years (3 1/2 times). This means that the true remnant 
    church comes into the open after the <a href="h-wound.html">end of the 1260 years</a> of
    <a href="claims.html">little horn 
    dominion</a>.</li>
    <li>That it is the &quot;remnant&quot; church indicates that it teaches the same pure 
    biblical doctrines of the apostolic church.</li>
    <li>The true church arises geographically from where it was helped, the 
    earth. This is symbolic for the relatively sparsely populated New World of 
    North America. The harlot church arose from the sea (Revelation 13:1), which 
    symbolically represents densely populated Europe (Revelation 17:15). </li>
    <li>There are two more characteristics that identify the true church, they 
    keep the Ten Commandments, and have the gift of prophecy. These are the 
    exact remedy to the two things the little horn power thinks to change, as 
    revealed in Daniel 7:25 and Daniel 8:11-14.</li>

  Judaea,<br>
  Mat 3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.<br>

  <p align="left">The prophet Elijah fled to the wilderness for refuge from Ahab 
  and Jezebel while 
  withholding the rain for 3 1/2 years (1 Ki 17:1, James 5:17), and after confronting Ahab 
  regarding his forsaking the law of God (1 Ki 18:18), and having Jezebel's false 
  prophets of Baal slain (1 Ki 18:40). Jezebel was a harlot (2 Ki 9:22), and 
  issued a death decree against Elijah (1 Ki 19:2). Elijah's message was one of repentance, obedience 
  to God's law, and to serve and worship only the true God (1 Ki 18:21), which 
  is to say, Elijah preached restoration of true worship in a time of gross 
  apostasy.</p>
  <p align="left">John the Baptist was imprisoned by Herod Antipas at the insistence of 
  Herodias (Matt 14:3). Herodias was an adulteress (Mark 6:18), and had Herod 
  put John to death (Mark 6:22-27) with the assistance of her daughter. John the 
  Baptist preached in the spirit of the prophet Elijah in the wilderness: 
  repentance, the law (Matt 14:4), and the imminent coming of the Lord.</p>
  <p align="left">Like the previous typology, the end time Elijah faces three 
  adversaries (Rev 16:13), but on a larger scale:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
  The <a href="dragon.html">dragon</a>, represents Satan working 
  through the civil government, which is to say the kings of the earth, as 
  typified by Ahab, Herod the Great (Rev 12:3-4), and Herod Antipas (Mark 6:27).</li>
    <li>
  The <a href="666.html">beast from the sea</a> (Rev 13:1) /
  <a href="vatican.html">harlot Mystery Babylon</a> (Rev 17) represents the 
  apostate mother church, typified by Jezebel and Herodias. Jezebel symbolically 
  represents the apostate church of the middle ages in Revelation 2:20-24, the 
  message to Thyatira. The 1260 years are the space to repent (Rev 2:21), and in 
  1798 she is cast into a sickbed (Rev 2:22). Her apostate children are doomed 
  (Rev 2:23), but a faithful uncorrupted remnant will be saved (Rev 2:24).</li>
    <li>
  The land beast (Rev 13:11) / false prophet (Rev 19:20) 
  represents the harlot Protestant daughter churches (Rev 17:5) of the apostate 
  mother church, typified by Jezebel's false prophets of Baal and Herodias' 
  daughter.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">The Elijah Message: Restoring the Law of 
  God</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">The Elijah message of restoration of, and obedience to God's 
  law (1 Ki 18:18, Mal 4:4, Matt 17:11), is proclaimed again on a global scale just 
  prior to the second coming of the Lord, by the true church emerging from the 
  wilderness. As the previous events show, the Elijah message will prompt the 
  apostate harlot mother to use her harlot daughters to force the kings of the 
  earth to persecute the final Elijah. The final Elijah gospel message is 
  recorded in Revelation 14:</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Revelation 1</font></b><font size="5"><b>4</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the 
    everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
    nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
    Rev 14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the 
    hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, 
    and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<br>
    Rev 14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is 
    fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of 
    the wrath of her fornication.<br>
    Rev 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any 
    man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, 
    or in his hand,<br>
    Rev 14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is 
    poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be 
    tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in 
    the presence of the Lamb:<br>
    Rev 14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and 
    they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and 
    whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<br>
    Rev 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
    commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Main Points in Revelation 14.</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proclaiming the messages of the three angels is the end time Elijah mission of 
    the true church, which begins only after the conclusion of the 1260 years in 
    1798 A.D., when the true church emerges from the wilderness, as described in 
    Revelation 12.</li>
    <li>The first message is that judgment has already begun (in 1844), and to worship 
    the creator, by keeping the Sabbath commandment, which is cited. These two points are 
    exactly the same as those identified in Daniel 7:25, Daniel 8:11-14, and 
    Revelation 12:17, 19:10.</li>
    <li>The second message proclaims and exposes apostasy in the church. 
    Revelation 18 repeats this message, and makes clear that one must not remain 
    in Babylon, you <i>must</i> leave it to be saved (Rev 18:4).</li>
    <li>The third message warns not to receive the <a href="seal.html">mark of 
    the beast</a> (<a href="notsun.html">Sunday keeping</a>), from which the 
    saints are immune because they keep the seventh day Sabbath commandment.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Conclusion: These Are The Days Of The Elijah Message.</b></p>

  <blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;Amos 3:7 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his 
secret unto his servants the prophets.</p>

<p>Isa 42:9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I 
declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</p>

<p>Joel 2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit 
upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men 
shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:<br>
Joel 2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I 
pour out my spirit.</p>

  </blockquote>

<p>God raises up prophets at both ends of major prophecies. The initial prophet 
announces the prophecy to come. At the fulfillment, another prophet of God is 
raised up to announce and explain it fully. It is only the true church that has 
this gift of the spirit of prophecy</p>

  <blockquote>

<p>John 13:19 <font color="#FF0000">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it 
is come to pass, ye may believe that I am <i>he</i>.<br>
</font>John 14:29 <font color="#FF0000">And now I have told you before it come 
to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</font></p>

  <p>The doctrinally pure remnant church with the gift of prophecy emerges in North America after 1798 
  A.D., and openly proclaims that according to Daniel's prophecy, judgment began 
  in 1844 A.D., and that keeping the Ten Commandments, specifically the seventh 
  day Sabbath, is the seal of God that gives immunity to the mark of the beast. 
  This is the prophesied Elijah message proclaimed &quot;before the coming of the 
  great and dreadful day of the LORD.&quot; It is present truth that unequivocally 
  identifies the Seventh-Day Adventist Church as the true end time church of 
  Bible prophecy.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>The Danger of Rejecting the Lord's Prophet.</b></p>
    <p align="left">Noah's warning of the impending flood was a message from God 
    that was rejected by the antediluvian world. Those who believed and heeded 
    Noah entered the ark by faith and were saved. Those who rejected Noah and 
    his prophetic warning perished in the flood.</p>
    <p align="left">Moses and Aaron were challenged by Korah and 250 leaders of 
    Israel who rebelled against them (Num 16), rejecting their divine 
    appointment. The rebels all perished, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram with their 
    families when the earth opened up and swallowed them (Num 16:32), and the 
    250 when fire fell from heaven and consumed them (Num 16:35). The following 
    day a multitude of the people still opposed Moses and Aaron, and accused 
    them of killing the men of God (Num 16:41). The Lord sent a plague among the 
    rebels, and 14,700 perished that day.</p>
    <p align="left">When the priests and the elders of the temple challenged 
    Jesus regarding His authority, He asked them about John the Baptist, was he 
    a prophet sent by heaven (Mat 21:25-27)? Rather than publicly reject John as 
    a prophet, because they feared the people who believed John a prophet, they 
    said they did not know. Jesus then states that tax collectors and harlots 
    believed John to be a prophet and repented, and they would be in the kingdom 
    (Matt 21: 31-32). Jesus then told the parable of the vineyard, which 
    represented Israel. The husbandmen of the vineyard beat and killed the 
    servants of the owner (prophets) sent to them, and even killed the owner's 
    son (Matt 21:37-39). Jesus was prophesying that because Israel had rejected 
    the prophets, they would also reject and crucify Him, the Son of God.. As a 
    result, the husbandmen would be destroyed (Mat 21:41). Jesus characterized 
    those who rejected His prophets as serpents and vipers:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Mat 23:33 <font color="#FF0000">Ye serpents, ye generation 
    of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</font><br>
    Mat 23:34 <font color="#FF0000">Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, 
    and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and 
    some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from 
    city to city:</font><br>
    Mat 23:35 <font color="#FF0000">That upon you may come all the righteous 
    blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood 
    of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the 
    altar.</font><br>
    Mat 23:36 <font color="#FF0000">Verily I say unto you, All these things 
    shall come upon this generation.</font><br>
    Mat 23:37 <font color="#FF0000">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest 
    the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I 
    have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens 
    under her wings, and ye would not!</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">If you do not receive the testimony of the prophets sent by 
    the Lord, you also reject the Lord who sent them.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Luke 16:31 <font color="#FF0000">And he said unto him, If 
    they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though 
    one rose from the dead.</font></p>
    <p align="left">John 5:45 <font color="#FF0000">Do not think that I will 
    accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in 
    whom ye trust.</font><br>
    John 5:46 <font color="#FF0000">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have 
    believed me: for he wrote of me.</font><br>
    John 5:47 <font color="#FF0000">But if ye believe not his writings, how 
    shall ye believe my words?</font></p>
    <p align="left">Mat 10:40 <font color="#FF0000">He that receiveth you 
    receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</font><br>
    Mat 10:41 <font color="#FF0000">He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a 
    prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous 
    man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.</font></p>
