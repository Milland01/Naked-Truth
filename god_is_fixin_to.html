<blockquote>
  <p>In 1998 Israel celebrated its 50th Anniversary as a nation, and at that 
  time huckster Steve Munsey, on behalf of <a href="http://www.lesea.org/"><b>
  LeSEA</b></a> ministries, used the opportunity to exploit that event by 
  promoting it as a 50th, or Jubilee year, when God was prepared to cancel 
  financial debts and bless his people with the riches they had waited for <i>so</i> 
  long.&nbsp; <i>This was an opportunity not to be missed</i>. Of course the 
  only thing holding up this windfall was the need to give your seed money to 
  LeSEA. Only then could God bless <i>you</i> with the unlimited riches he was 
  fixin' to pay out.</p>

  Steve Munsey - Jubilee Telethon 2000 - © 2000 LeSEA</p>
  <p>Well, January of 2000 was telethon time again for LeSEA, and lo and behold 
  - what do you know, the Catholic Church (the Pope no less), has declared the 
  year 2000 a Jubilee year, and that beginning this year the church will no 
  longer be in poverty! Well if the pope declared it, it must be true. What a 
  stroke of luck for LeSEA! Now, once again, Steve Munsey claims the Lord has 
  spoken directly to him, and God wants to bless his people with vast riches on 
  this 7th millennium Jubilee year too! He says we are about to receive the 
  greatest financial miracle in the history of mankind. But again, the <i>only</i> 
  way to cash in on what God is fixin' to do, and dramatically change your life 
  forever, is to send your 7 x 70 dollars to LeSEA, then you can expect your own 
  financial miracle <i>within days</i>. Your days of riches and power are now! 
  Fortunately, there is more than one way to win. You can send your &quot;law of 
  release&quot; offering of 49 dollars a month for 10 months, or 70 dollars for 7 
  months, either is a lucky winning combination in this &quot;spirit of 7&quot; year. 
  Imagine that, God has told Steve Munsey the secret magic numbers that will pay 
  off with <i><b>big</b></i> money! But if you keep your hand closed (don't give 
  to LeSEA) you <i>cannot</i> receive a blessing. God has blessed a women with 
  800 <i>million</i> dollars from a father she did not know, and this is about 
  to happen <i>all over the world</i>.&nbsp; In fact, if you do sow your seed 
  money with LeSEA, you will soon become <i>so</i> wealthy that you will be able 
  to loan large sums of money to your friends, but only if you take advantage of 
  this period of 7 jubilee release offer NOW!</p>
  <p>God is being promoted something like the ultimate lottery, roulette wheel 
  or slot machine that is fixin' to pay off soon, but you can't win if you don't 
  play. As for LeSEA, well who knows, Steve Munsey says they just might decide 
  to buy CBS TV (probably with the money you send in). Just imagine what they 
  could rake in with all those CBS stations to run more telethons from. It 
  boggles the mind!</p>
  <p>What a disgrace! It really is amazing the depths some ministries will sink 
  to in order to extract money from their viewers. Had you tuned to LeSEA
  <a href="http://real.lesea.com/wht.ram"><b>World Harvest TV</b></a><b> </b>
  during this telethon, you would have seen snake oil salesmanship at its 
  finest, or should I say at its lowest. You see, Steve Munsey has no idea if 
  this year is the beginning of the seventh millennium, or last year was, or if 
  it will be next year or ten years from now. <i>Nobody</i> knows this for 
  certain. It would <i>not</i> matter if we did know the exact year the 7th 
  millennium would begin. But don't let the facts get in the way of a good sales 
  pitch. It makes one wonder just <i>how</i> they will come up with <i>another</i> 
  Jubilee, to flog for all its worth, in another year or two. Or maybe that 
  horse will be dead by then, because their audience will be wise to the con. 
  Then Steve Munsey and LeSEA will have to come with some new gimmick to fleece 
  the viewers.</p>

  <p><font color="#000000">We did not have to wait very long for Steve Munsey to 
  resurrect his 7th millennium gimmick. He appeared on Daystar's Fall telethon 
  on October 16th and announced God had revealed a rhema word to him. We are <i>
  not</i> yet in the new millennium. The year 2000 was celebrated <i>only</i> by 
  Americans as the beginning of the new millennium, but <i>actually</i>, the new 
  7th millennium begins at midnight on December 31st, 2000.</font></p>
  <p>Also, Steve noted that on the third day of creation, God <i>twice</i> said 
  that it was good. So, by this and other equally preposterous evidence, there 
  is allegedly a &quot;double portion&quot; blessing fixin' to happen to the people of God 
  on the coming third day. <font color="#000000">Because 2001 will be the &quot;third 
  day&quot; since the birth of Christ (1000 years is a day), and simultaneously the 
  7th millennium since creation, the magic number for your seed money is now 37, 
  so, give $37 dollars a month for 10 months, and you will receive a &quot;double 
  portion&quot; blessing on your finances in the new millennium. In addition, your 
  unbelieving children will be saved, and you will have your life extended 15 
  years by the &quot;Hezekiah miracle&quot; (2 Kings 20:5-6). But obviously, if you don't 
  give your seed money now in faith, you will likely <i>not</i> receive these 
  miracle blessings.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">God told Steve Munsey to fill 6 large pots with 
  pledge slips, representing the water pots of Christ's first miracle (which 
  happened on the third day, John 2:1) and also had donor's names written on the 
  outside of the pots. At the conclusion of the program, during prayer, he then
  <i>smashed</i> the water pots on the floor to &quot;release&quot; the breakthrough 
  &quot;double portion&quot; blessings for those who had been obedient and given donations 
  to Daystar.</font></p>

  TELETHON</font></b></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Well God has again spoken to Steve Munsey so that he 
  can give a prophetic utterance to us.&nbsp; I'll bet you just can't wait to 
  know what secrets have been revealed to Steve. Just how do you think one might 
  work the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 into a Daystar telethon to 
  raise money? Well you see, according to Steve, Jesus Christ was actually born 
  on September 11th of 3 B.C., and Satan <i>hates</i> that date <i>so much</i> 
  that he caused the antichrist terrorist attacks on 9-11-2001 so that the 
  attention of God's people might be diverted from the season of blessing that 
  God is fixin' to bestow on His people in the next few months, during the 
  Spring of 2002. God is fixin' to touch your business, your finances, your 
  children and your health in the coming months if you are willing to sow your 
  &quot;seed&quot; money in the fertile ground of Daystar TV now! You see, a double 
  blessing is coming upon those who contribute to Daystar in this year of double 
  completeness! It's a year of double completeness because 2001 in the season of 
  Atonement (Sept-Oct) began the 7th millennium since creation, and 2001 was 
  also the beginning of the 3rd millennium since the birth of Christ. </font>
  </p>
  <p><font color="#000000">WOW! Amazing! Could it be true? Well, please note 
  that this is the <i>second</i> time that Steve has <i>changed </i>the start 
  date of the 7th millennium so that he can continue to use it in telethons to 
  raise money. Previously he had changed it from December 31st of 1999 to 
  December 31st of 2000, now he says the 7th millennium actually began on 
  September 11th of 2001!</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">Now according to Steve, we don't really know from God 
  exactly when the 7th millennium began, but Satan surely marked its beginning 
  with September 11th, so that is how we know without doubt, because Satan gave 
  September 11th of 2001 his stamp of evil attack! So, since we are only now 
  entering the new 7th millennium, if you will faithfully pledge to give $37 
  dollars a month for 12 months to take advantage of this 3rd day/7th day 
  opportunity, God will know he can trust you and bless you accordingly.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#000000">One problem with the above. If as Steve says, Jesus 
  was really born on September 11th of 3 B.C., then precisely how long has it 
  been since that day? You would have to add 3 years to 2002, making it actually 
  no less than the year 2005. So if God was planning on blessing His people in 
  the initial year of the seventh millennium (2001), then that was at least <i>
  four years ago!</i> &nbsp;</font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">But wait! Historians who have studied the subject 
  tell us that King Herod died in the Spring of 4 B.C. shortly after a partial 
  eclipse of the moon. Remember Herod? When he heard that the Christ child was 
  born, he sent his soldiers to slay every infant under 2 years old in Bethlehem 
  (Mat 2:16). Well, if Herod died in 4 B.C., then Jesus could not possibly have 
  been born in 3 B.C., but rather in 5 B.C. or earlier. That would, if correct, 
  mean that the 7th millennium likely started back in 1996!&nbsp;</font></p>

  <a href="year.html"><b>What Year Was Jesus Born?</b></a></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000000">So, has God really spoken to Steve Munsey, and given 
  him the secret prophetic word about the 7th millennium, the key to wealth and 
  health? In my opinion, </font>heaven must surely weep at crass displays of 
  theatrics, con games, greed and deceit to raise money in the name of God. But 
  you be the judge. Scripture clearly warns us about false prophets and some of 
  those claiming to be working in the name of God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my 
    name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto 
    them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of 
    nought, and the deceit of their heart.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:20 <font color="#FF0000">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know 
    them.</font><br>
    Mat 7:21 <font color="#FF0000">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, 
    shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my 
    Father which is in heaven.</font><br>
    Mat 7:22 <font color="#FF0000">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, 
    have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? 
    and in thy name done many wonderful works?</font><br>
    Mat 7:23 <font color="#FF0000">And then will I profess unto them, I never 
    knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#000000">DAYSTAR'S FALL 2002 
    TELETHON</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">On Wednesday, 18 September, and Thursday 19 September, 2002, 
  during their fall<i> CELEBRATION SHARATHON</i>, DAYSTAR repeatedly rebroadcast 
  Steve Munsey's high pressure fund raising performance from the Spring 2002<i> 
  ACROSS AMERICA</i> telethon (discussed above), in which he many times stated 
  that it was a <i>live</i> broadcast, yet there was no indication at all on the 
  screen that it was in fact a <i>taped</i> program some <b><i>six months old</i></b>. 
  I ask you, isn't it less than honest to do that?</p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="5" color="#000000">DAYSTAR'S SPRING 2003 
    TELETHON</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Daystar dusted off their video tape and rebroadcast Steve Munsey's money 
  raising performance from the Spring of 2002 on April 24th and 25th of 2003, 
  again without an indication on the screen that it was a year old prerecorded 
  telethon. Viewers tuning in to the program in progress might be easily 
  deceived into thinking it was a live program, since Steve Munsey said it was 
  live, repeatedly. But then, as long as playing this tape makes even more money 
  for Daystar, who really cares that the viewers have been misled this way? 
  Apparently Daystar doesn't think it important to be completely up front and 
  honest with their viewers when raising money.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">2006 - THE LAW OF SIX</font></p>
  <p align="left">Who could have guessed it? God has revealed to Steve Munsey, 
  during a 21 day fast, that 2006 is the sixth year of the new millennium, which 
  means that God's law of six applies, and He is fixin' to bless you with a 
  double portion. But in order to be a winner in this number game, guess what 
  you have to do? That's right, you can't expect a harvest if you don't sow a 
  seed. You see, there are supposedly 232 instances of the law of six in the 
  Bible, and if you expect to be a winner under the law of six, you will have to 
  send in your donation. Both <a href="http://www.bennyhinn.org/emailletters/enl65munsey.cfm">Benny Hinn</a> 
  (Jan 23, 2006), Paula White (Aug 21, 2006), and TBN's fall 2006 telethon, have 
  had Steve Munsey as a guest on their programs to promote this law of six 
  fundraising scheme. Well as we have seen, God has a habit of telling Steve 
  Munsey the secret winning numbers that will make you rich: for TBN this is 
  $60, $600, or $6000 a month for 10 months! Who can doubt this?</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">FLEECING THE
  PASSOVER SHEEP 2007</font></p>
  <p align="left">Steve Munsey is on the road again with his traveling 
  fundraising huckster show, appearing again with <a href="http://www.paulawhite.org/">Paula White</a>. 
  Now he is promising 
  seven supernatural blessings from Exodus 23 for those who know how to release 
  the favor of God. Let's see, 7 blessings. Hmmm, what might be the winning 
  secret number this time? Well if you guessed $77 dollars, you are well on your 
  way to a windfall from heaven. What does your $77 dollars get you?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">1. God will assign an angel to you.<br>
      2. God will be an enemy to your enemies.<br>
      3. God will give you prosperity.<br>
      4. God will take sickness away from you.<br>
      5. God will give you a long life.<br>
      6. God will bring increase and inheritance.<br>
      7. God will give a special year of blessing.</p>
      <p align="left">And a communion set for two!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Wow! Angels are for 
  hire, and God Himself will fight your enemies (but only after your VERY BEST 
  Passover offering has cleared the bank for Paula White's ministry). God is depicted as the ultimate mercenary.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">2007 - THE YEAR OF SEVEN</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Well, how lucky we are, that $77 dollar offering you make, or 
  $770, or $7700 dollars to Paula White are a <i>perfect</i> match with this 
  year of spiritual completeness and perfection. I'll bet you didn't know how 
  many lucky sevens that there are to be found in the Bible, well Steve and 
  Paula apparently do, and all those sevens mean big money! Imagine what a 
  hundred fold return would be. Just think, Paula White can use this program all 
  year long to part the sheep from their money!</p>
