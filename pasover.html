<h2><b>Was Jesus crucified on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday?</b></h2>
</center><hr>
<blockquote>
	What follows is a chronology of the events surrounding the crucifixion and resurrection 
	of Jesus Christ presented in a plausible and logical way in an effort to resolve 
	that question. To begin, at what time of day does the Bible say that Jesus died 
	on the cross? ...<blockquote>
		Mat 27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
		<font color="#FF0000">Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?</font> that is to say, 
		My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br>Mat 27:50 Jesus, when he had 
		cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. <br><br>Mark 15:34 And at the 
		ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <font color="#FF0000">
		Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</font> which is, being interpreted, My God, 
		my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br>Mark 15:37 And Jesus cried with a 
		loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</blockquote>
	The scriptures tell us that the Messiah died sometime around the 9th hour of 
	the day (9 hours after the sun had risen). The ninth hour would be about our 
	3pm in the afternoon and He was put in the sepulchre before sunset. Bear in 
	mind that the reason they were in a hurry to bury Jesus was because the next 
	day of the week, the Sabbath, 
	would begin at sundown ...<blockquote>
		Luke 23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</blockquote>
	... this is because the Hebrew day begins and ends at sunset, as the Bible makes 
	plain, and Jews practice even today-<blockquote>
		Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. 
		And the *evening and the morning* were the first day. <br><br>Lev 23:32 ... from 
		even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	Now exactly which Sabbath day, the first day of Unleavened Bread, or the Seventh 
	day (Saturday) Sabbath?
	<blockquote>
		Luke 23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.<br>Luke 
		23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre 
		that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.<br>Luke 23:54 
		And that day was the preparation [Friday], and the sabbath drew on.<br>Luke 
		23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, 
		and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.<br>Luke 23:56 And they 
		returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <b>rested the sabbath day 
		according to the commandment. </b>[seventh day Saturday sabbath]<br>Luke 
		24:1 Now upon the first day of the week [Sunday], very early in the morning, 
		they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, 
		and certain others with them.<br><br>Mark 16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary 
		Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, 
		that they might come and anoint him.<br>Mark 16:2 And very early in the 
		morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising 
		of the sun.</blockquote>
	The women viewed the sepulchre and the body of Jesus on the preparation day 
	(Friday evening before sunset) and then rested according to the 4th Commandment, 
	on the Saturday Sabbath. When the Saturday Sabbath had past, the women returned 
	to the tomb at sunrise, and that day was the first day of the week (Sunday). 
	Clearly then, Jesus was crucified on Friday afternoon, the preparation day for 
	the Saturday Sabbath.<br><br>

	<p>This Friday preparation day (paraskeue:G3904) is mentioned in Mat 27:62, 
	Mk 15:42, Lk 23:54, Jn 19:14, 19:31 and 19:42. It is important to note that 
	in the Bible, only the 6th day of the week is defined as the preparation day (Exo. 
	16:5), for the 7th day Sabbath, but <em>not</em> the day preceding a yearly festival 
	sabbath. The term <em>always</em> means what we call Friday, in both scriptural 
	and non-scriptural usage:</p>
	<blockquote>
		2. &quot;Caesar Augustus, high priest and tribune of the people, ordains 
		thus: Since the nation of the Jews hath been found grateful to the Roman 
		people, not only at this time, but in time past also, and chiefly Hyrcanus 
		the high priest, under my father Caesar the emperor, it seemed good to me 
		and my counselors, according to the sentence and oath of the people of Rome, 
		that the Jews have liberty to make use of their own customs, according to 
		the law of their forefathers, as they made use of them under Hyrcanus the 
		high priest of the Almighty God; and that their sacred money be not touched, 
		but be sent to Jerusalem, and that it be committed to the care of the receivers 
		at Jerusalem; and that they be not obliged to go before any judge on the 
		sabbath day, nor on the day of the preparation to it, after the ninth hour. &mdash; 
		Josephus,

	</blockquote>
	<p align="left">Also note that in Leviticus 23 there is this important distinction 
	made between the seventh day sabbath and the first day of unleavened bread: 
	no work was to be done on the seventh day sabbath (v. 3), and no <em>servile</em> 
	work on 15 Abib / Nisan (v. 7). Servile work is done for an employer or as 
	an occupation, for a living or wages 
	so to speak. </p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Lev 23:1-3 (KJV)</p>
		<p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And the
		<span ="font-variant:="" small-caps"="">Lord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,
		<span "Verdana" "Arial" "Helvetica" ,="" ,="" ,="" 0.7em;="" 4px;="" ="font-size:="" bold"="" font-family:="" font-weight:="" sans-serif;="" vertical-align:="">
		<br><sup><strong>2</strong></sup></span>&nbsp;Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
		<i>Concerning</i> the feasts of the
		<span ="font-variant:="" small-caps"="">Lord</span>, which ye shall proclaim
		<i>to be</i> holy convocations, <i>even</i> these <i>are</i> my feasts.
		<span "Verdana" "Arial" "Helvetica" ,="" ,="" ,="" 0.7em;="" 4px;="" ="font-size:="" bold"="" font-family:="" font-weight:="" sans-serif;="" vertical-align:="">
		<br><sup><strong>3</strong></sup></span>&nbsp;Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day <i>is</i> 
		the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work <i>therein</i>: 
		it <i>is</i> the sabbath of the <span ="font-variant:="" small-caps"="">
		Lord</span> in all your dwellings.</span></p>
		<p 80px"="" ="margin-left:="">Lev 23:6-7 (KJV)<br>
		<span "Verdana" "Arial" "Helvetica" ,="" ,="" ,="" 0.7em;="" 4px;="" ="font-size:="" bold"="" font-family:="" font-weight:="" sans-serif;="" vertical-align:="">
		<sup><strong>
		<br>6</strong></sup></span>&nbsp;And on the fifteenth day of the same month <i>is</i> the 
		feast of unleavened bread unto the
		<span ="font-variant:="" small-caps"="">Lord</span>: seven days ye must 
		eat unleavened bread.
		<span "Verdana" "Arial" "Helvetica" ,="" ,="" ,="" 0.7em;="" 4px;="" ="font-size:="" bold"="" font-family:="" font-weight:="" sans-serif;="" vertical-align:="">
		<br><sup><strong>7</strong></sup></span>&nbsp;In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall 
		do no servile work therein.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So non-servile work was not permitted on the seventh day sabbath, but it 
	was permitted on 15 Abib / Nisan. Presumably the burial could have been done 
	after sunset if it were only 15 Nisan, but not on a seventh day sabbath. Therefore 
	the "no work" on the seventh day sabbath was the reason for burial before sunset, 
	because that began the seventh day sabbath (which coincided with 15 Nisan that 
	year, making it a high sabbath). </p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Now here is the logic some people will give for a Wednesday crucifixion -</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>One cannot get three days and three nights (Matt 12:40) from &quot;Good 
		Friday&quot; to &quot;Easter Sunday.&quot; Friday and Saturday nights are 
		two nights, and Saturday is one day. This is only one day and two nights, 
		what about the other two days and one night? Friday can't possibly be the 
		day Jesus died.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This is the result of trying to use literal western thinking and applying 
	it to the text, implying that there should be a full 72 hours between the crucifixion 
	and the resurrection. But that is not the intent of the passage. For proof lets 
	look at what the Gospels and other books have to say about the matter -</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mat 16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples, 
		how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders 
		and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again *the third 
		day*.</p>

		<p>Mark 9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them,
		<font color="#FF0000">The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, 
		and they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise *the 
		third* day.</font></font></p>
		<p>Mark 10:34 <font color="#FF0000">And they shall mock him, and shall scourge 
		him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and *the third day* he 
		shall rise again.</font></font></p>
		<p>Luke 9:22 Saying, <font color="#FF0000">The Son of man must suffer many 
		things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and 
		be slain, and be raised *the third day*.</font></font></p>

</div>
<blockquote>
	<p>So now, just WHICH day was the third day? Notice the following verses from 
	the 24th chapter of Luke:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Luke 24:1 Now *upon the first day of the week*, very early in the morning, 
		they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, 
		and certain others with them.</font></p>
		<p>Luke 24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of 
		sinful men, and be crucified, and *the third day* rise again.</font></p>
		<p>Luke 24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed 
		Israel: and beside all this, *to day is the third day* since these things 
		were done.</font></p>
		<p>Luke 24:46 And (Jesus) said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Thus it 
		is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead 
		*the third day*:</font></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This passage makes plain that on Sunday the *first day of the week* (v. 1), 
	the two angels at the tomb said He would rise *the third day* (v. 7), and on 
	the same day on the road to Emmaus the two disciples stated it was *the third 
	day* (v. 21), and Jesus says he would rise *the third day* (v. 46). So clearly 
	Sunday was the third day the angels and Jesus were speaking of, the day on which 
	Jesus rose from the grave. With that in mind, note this verse:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mark 16:9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he 
		appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Those who advocate a Wednesday crucifixion must adhere to a Saturday afternoon 
	resurrection, but the above verses, in conjunction with Mark 16:9, refute that 
	very nicely.</font></p>
	<p>Yet, some will still point to Matthew 28:1 to show that the women first came 
	to the tomb late on the sabbath (Saturday) near sunset:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mat 28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first 
		day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This point is quickly clarified by looking at Mark's account:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mark 16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the 
		mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come 
		and anoint him.<br>Mark 16:2 And very early in the morning the first day 
		of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.<br>Mark 
		16:3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from 
		the door of the sepulchre?</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Clearly the women came to the tomb at sunrise, finding the tomb empty. So 
	what about the strange wording of Matthew 28:1? The explanation can be found 
	in the division of the text into verses. The original Greek texts contain no 
	punctuation, or chapter or verse markings. These were later added as a convenience 
	to the reader. By merely reorganizing Matthew 27:66 and 28:1 as follows, the 
	apparent ambiguity completely disappears:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mat 27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, 
		the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,<br>Mat 27:63 
		Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, 
		After three days I will rise again.<br>Mat 27:64 Command therefore that 
		the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come 
		by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from 
		the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.<br>Mat 27:65 
		Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as 
		ye can.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Note that in verse 62, the request for a guard on the tomb was made on a 
	Sabbath (the day after the preparation) and that the request was for a guard 
	until the third day. Now, here is how the following verses should be printed:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mat 27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, 
		and setting a watch in the end of the sabbath.<br>Mat 28:1 As it began to 
		dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other 
		Mary to see the sepulchre.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Note that the wording is <em>not changed</em>, merely the dividing point 
	of the verses is changed by moving the period ending verse sixty-six. It was 
	the watch guarding the tomb that began at the end of the sabbath! This shows 
	that Matthew and Mark agree completely as to when the women came to the tomb: 
	just before the rising of the sun at dawn, the first day of the week, Sunday.</font></p>
	<p>Since Jesus was to rise the third day, the Roman guards were put in place 
	immediately at the end of the Sabbath, because they anticipated the body being 
	stolen by the Jews sometime on Sunday, the third (and next) day. Had they anticipated 
	the theft on Saturday, then the guard would have been in place by Friday evening, 
	(the preparation day).</font></p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Sunday, as we have seen, actually began at sunset on Saturday evening, and 
	by Jewish reckoning any part of a day is counted as a day. So working backwards:</font></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sunday, was the third day, the day of the resurrection.</font></li>
		<li>Saturday (Sabbath) was the second day that Christ rested in the tomb.</font></li>
		<li>Friday (Preparation day) was the first day, the day of the crucifixion.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note that in Luke 24:18 - 21, the events of the three days begin with the 
	arrest and trial of Jesus, not with His burial! </font></p>
	<p>Jesus was crucified on Friday and died at 3 p.m. He rose from the dead somewhere 
	between Saturday after sunset and sunrise on Sunday morning. There is absolutely 
	no way to push the crucifixion back to Wednesday and fit scripture. A Wednesday 
	crucifixion is clearly impossible.</font></p>
	<p><b><u>Three days and Three nights.</font></u></b></p>
	<p>Oh, but then what of these apparently troublesome verses, don't they preclude 
	a Friday crucifixion?-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mat 12:40 <font color="#FF0000">For as Jonas was three days and three 
		nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three 
		nights in the heart of the earth.</font></font></p>
		<p>Mat 27:63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he 
		was yet alive, *After three days* I will rise again.</font></p>
		<p>Mark 8:31 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer 
		many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and 
		scribes, and be killed, and *after three days* rise again.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>These verses are appealed to in order to propose a full 72 hours in the grave. 
	They do seem to say a full 3 days and 3 nights don't they? How can this possibly 
	be reconciled with the traditional chronology? If you believe the Bible cannot 
	contradict itself, then these verses MUST be harmonized with the rest of scripture 
	on the subject. Well, please note the following story in 1 Kings-</font></p>
	<p align="center"><b><u><font size="4">The third day (inclusive reckoning)</font></u></b></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>1 Ki 12:5 And he said unto them, Depart yet *for three days*, then come 
		again to me. And the people departed.</font></p>
		<p>1 Ki 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam *the third 
		day*, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again *the third day*.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The king tells the people to depart for three days, but they return ON the 
	third day, not on the fourth!! Why? Because the king did not mean to be gone 
	for a full 72 hours. The counting of days was inclusive in nature. The same 
	day that the king told them to leave was the first day. The second day they 
	stayed away, and then they returned the third day, as the king had intended. 
	This is the exactly the same manner of counting used for the resurrection. It 
	is inclusive in nature, with whatever portion of the first and last days being 
	counted as full days.</font></p>
	<p>Just for good measure, this same story is told in 2 Chronicles-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>2 Chr 10:5 And he said unto them, Come again unto me *after three days*. 
		And the people departed.</font></p>
		<p>2 Chr 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam *on the third 
		day*, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me *on the third day*.</font></p>

	<p>Note the way this is worded compared to 1 Kings. Come again unto me after 
	three days, depart yet for three days, and Come again to me on the third day, 
	these all mean exactly the same thing, which is NOT a full three days or a full 
	72 hours.</font></p>
	<p>Here is a similar situation of inclusive reckoning in the book of Esther:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Est 4:16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, 
		and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink <b>three days, night or day</b>: 
		I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, 
		which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.<br>Est 4:17 
		So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded 
		him.<br>Est 5:1 Now it came to pass <b>on the third day</b>, that Esther 
		put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, 
		over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in 
		the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Note that here in Luke 13, the third day clearly means the day after tomorrow,
	<i>not</i> after 3 full days:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Luke 13:31 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto 
		him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.<br>Luke 13:32 
		And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, 
		I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and <b>the third 
		day</b> I shall be perfected.</font><br>Luke 13:33 <font color="#FF0000">
		Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and <b>the day following</b>: 
		for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</font></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So, in light of all the evidence, Matt 12:40, 27:63 and Mark 8:31 do not 
	really mean a full literal three days and nights or 72 hours, since Jesus clearly 
	rose ON the third day. By Jewish understanding, referred to as inclusive reckoning, 
	three days and three nights, and after three days, simply meant the same thing 
	as ON the third day.</font></p>

		<p>Mark 9:31 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them,

		<p>Luke 24:7 Saying, <span style="color: #FF0000"> <u>The Son of man must be delivered into the hands

		<p></font>Luke 24:18 And the one of them, whose

	</blockquote>
	<p>Note that the &quot;things&quot; include Jesus' betrayal and being put on 
	trial. See also:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Matt 16:21; Matt 20:18-19;<br>Mark 8:31; Mark 10:33-34;<br>Luke 9:22; 
		Luke 18:32-33; Luke 24:46.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So the phrase &quot;in the heart of the earth&quot; does not begin with burial 
	in the tomb, as some suppose, but rather with Christ being betrayed into the 
	hands of sinners for trial, on what we would call Thursday night (by Jewish 
	reckoning the early evening hours that began Friday, 14 Nisan, Passover). That 
	was the beginning of the 3 days and 3 nights.</font></p>
	<p><b><u>The Lord's Passover</font></u></b></p>
	<p>Next, lets look at when the Passover really begins. Sometimes in the Bible, 
	the phrases &quot;Feast of Unleavened Bread&quot; or &quot;Passover&quot; are 
	used to describe the combination of 14 Nisan (The Lord's Passover) with the 
	subsequent week long Feast of Unleavened Bread. So the first day of the Feast 
	of Unleavened Bread (in this general sense), would then be 14 Nisan. This habit 
	can cause some confusion if you are not careful, as follows:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Mat 26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples 
		came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee 
		to eat the passover?</font></p>
		<p>Mark 14:12 And the first day of unleavened bread, *when they killed the 
		passover*, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare 
		that thou mayest eat the passover?</font></p>
		<p>Luke 22:1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called 
		the Passover.<br>Luke 22:7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, *when 
		the passover must be killed*.<br>Luke 22:8 And he sent Peter and John, saying,
		<font color="#FF0000">Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</font></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The above verses seem to say that the Passover lamb was to be slain on the 
	first day of unleavened bread, or 15 Nisan (but actually refer to 14 Nisan, 
	as will be shown) Now, the following verse refers to the Passover meal as occurring 
	on 15 Nisan, the evening after the crucifixion, also 15 Nisan:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>John 18:28 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: 
		and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest 
		they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>This confusion can be cleared up by looking in Exodus, Leviticus and 2 Chronicles 
	-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Exo 12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: 
		ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:<br>Exo 12:6 And 
		ye shall keep it up until <b>the fourteenth day of the same month</b>: and 
		the whole assembly of the congregation of <b>Israel shall kill it in the 
		evening</b> [<i>afternoon of the 14th</i>].<br>Exo 12:7 And they shall take 
		of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door 
		post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.<br>Exo 12:8 And they shall 
		eat the flesh in that night [<i>early hours of the 15th</i>], roast with 
		fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.<br>
		Exo 12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with 
		fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.<br>Exo 12:10 
		And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which 
		remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</font></p>
		<p>Exo 12:18 In the first month, on <b>the fourteenth day of the month at 
		even, ye shall eat unleavened bread,</b> until the one and twentieth day 
		of the month at even.</font></p>
		<p>Lev 23:5 In <b>the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's 
		passover</b>.<br>Lev 23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is 
		the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened 
		bread.</font></p>
		<p>2 Chr 35:1&nbsp; Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
		<b>and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</b></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The Hebrew for Exo 12:6 and Lev 23:5 literally reads &quot;between the evenings&quot; 
	(H996 &amp; H6153). The first of these two evenings is when the sun begins its 
	descent from its zenith at noon, and the second when the sun sets at 6 pm. So 
	between the evenings refers to 3 pm, which also called the ninth hour.</font></p>
	<p>Clearly the Passover lamb was to be slain on the afternoon of the 14th of 
	Nisan and eaten in the night of the 15th of Nisan. Yet, according to Exodus 
	12:18, unleavened bread was also to be eaten beginning on the 14th of Nisan, 
	known as the Lord's passover, which is the day <em>before</em> the Festival 
	of Unleavened Bread (this is the reason for some confusion).</font></p>
	<p>So this was the time the Lord's supper took place - on what we would call 
	Thursday night, which was the 14th of Nisan, which consisted of bread and grape 
	juice, but no roast lamb. Later that very same day, in the afternoon about 3 
	pm, the Passover lamb was to be slain. That the Passover lamb was to be slain 
	in the afternoon of the 14th can be confirmed elsewhere in Exodus. Note when 
	the daily sacrifice of lambs was to take place:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Exo 29:39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other 
		lamb thou shalt offer at even:</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Here it is plain that the daily sacrifices included two lambs, the first 
	in the morning, and the second in the &quot;evening&quot;, meaning the afternoon 
	before sunset (Again the Hebrew literally reads &quot;between the evenings&quot; 
	(H996 &amp; H6153). The Jewish historian Josephus confirms that the Passover 
	lambs were slain from the ninth hour to the eleventh hour, that being from 3pm 
	to 5pm. </p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">So these high priests, upon the coming of that 
	feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from 
	the ninth hour till the eleventh, but so that a company not less than ten 
	belong to every sacrifice, ...&nbsp; <em><br>Wars of the Jews</em>, Book VI, Chapter IX, 
	<a href="http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/war-6.htm#EndNote_War_6.32a">Section 3</a></p>
	<p>&nbsp;Therefore, the 
	two events, the time for the killing of the Passover lamb and the death of Jesus, 
	coincided precisely on that Friday afternoon the 14th of Nisan, the Lord's Passover, 
	at 3pm.</font></p>
	<p>This is further confirmed by the timing of the original Passover in Egypt:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Exo 12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the 
		firstborn in the land of Egypt, ...</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Num 33:3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth 
		day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of 
		Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.</font></p>

	Passover lamb would be eaten, which would occur at the early hours of 15 Nisan, 
	the Paschal lamb symbolic of Jesus having been slain a few hours earlier on

	<p>The resurrection takes place at some time after the beginning of the day 
	(at sunset) but before the morning sunrise. Just exactly when after sunset the 
	resurrection took place is uncertain, but that it happened on what we today 
	call Sunday is really quite clear as Luke 24 showed, but here is more evidence-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>1 Cor 15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the Firstfruits 
		of them that slept.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>So just how does this verse relate?-</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Lev 23:10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When 
		ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest 
		thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the Firstfruits of your harvest 
		unto the priest:<br>Lev 23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, 
		to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall 
		wave it.</font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>The wave sheaf represented the first fruits of the resurrection, the Messiah 
	(1 Cor 15:20), and the day it was presented was the day AFTER the Sabbath as 
	Lev 23:11 just proved. (The Sabbath meant here is 15 Nisan/Abib, the first day 
	of Unleavened Bread [Lev 23:6-7]). Clearly then, since the first day of Unleavened 
	Bread coincided with the Seventh day Sabbath that year, the resurrection of 
	Jesus (the first fruits), happened on 16 Nisan/Abib the day AFTER the double 
	or high Sabbath, on the first day of the week, Sunday. (Because it represents 
	the resurrection, the day of Firstfruits must clearly occur <em>on the third 
	day</em> after the crucifixion [14 Nisan], to fulfill scripture.)</font></p>
	<hr>
	<p align="left"><b>The Manna A Prophecy</b></font></p>
	<p align="left">For even <em>more</em> evidence that the commonly accepted chronology 
	is correct, one must really understand the principle of type and antitype.&nbsp;Jesus 
	drew this parallel between Himself and manna:</font></p>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="left">John 6:31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it 
		is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.<br>John 6:32 Then Jesus 
		said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses 
		gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread 
		from heaven.</font><br>John 6:33 <font color="#FF0000">For the bread of 
		God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</font><br>
		...<br>John 6:47 <font color="#FF0000">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He 
		that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</font><br>John 6:48
		<font color="#FF0000">I am that bread of life.</font><br>John 6:49
		<font color="#FF0000">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and 
		are dead.</font><br>John 6:50 <font color="#FF0000">This is the bread which 
		cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</font><br>
		John 6:51 <font color="#FF0000">I am the living bread which came down from 
		heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread 
		that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</font><br>
		...<br>John 6:58 <font color="#FF0000">This is that bread which came down 
		from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth 
		of this bread shall live for ever.</font></font></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p align="left">Just as the manna did not spoil on the Sabbath day (Exo. 16:23-26), 
	the body of Jesus did not see corruption as He rested that day in the tomb (Psa. 
	16:10, Acts 2:27, 31). The symbolism of the manna specifically prophesies that 
	Jesus would spend the seventh day Sabbath, Saturday, at rest in the tomb in 
	an incorrupt state, because His body was without sin. This is why unleavened 
	bread is the only bread used during Passover week, because it represented the 
	incorrupt body of Jesus. If Jesus had been crucified on Wednesday, <i>that</i> 
	would have been the day the extra manna would have occurred, and it would have 
	not spoiled for the subsequent multiple <i>days</i> in the tomb, for which there 
	would be no new manna provided. However, the typology of the manna clearly does 
	not allow that scenario.</font></p>
	<p>The sequence of days to be observed for Passover was set down in scripture 
	as the &quot;type&quot;. This sequence was symbolic of what was to come when 
	the crucifixion of the Lamb of God actually took place, which is the &quot;antitype&quot;. 
	So the type and antitype must match precisely:</font> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>14 Nisan, the Lord's Passover is the type of the crucifixion day.</font></li>
		<li>15 Nisan, 1st day of Unleavened Bread, is the second day.</font></li>
		<li>16 Nisan, Firstfruits, is a type of the resurrection, and the third 
		day.</font></li>
	</ul>
	<p>An example of Israel keeping this precise scenario is found in the book of 
	Joshua:</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>

	<p>Josh 5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover 
	on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.<br>Josh 
	5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, 
	unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.<br>Josh 5:12 And the 
	manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; 
	neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit 
	of the land of Canaan that year.</font></p>

	<hr>
	<p align="center"><b><u><big>The Wednesday Crucifixion and the problem of Firstfruits</font></big></u></b></p>
	<p><u><b>Friday Firstfruits?</font></b></u></p>
	<p>Note that with a Wednesday crucifixion and literal 72 hours in the grave, 
	the resurrection would occur on a Saturday Sabbath, which should <em>precisely</em>
	<em>match</em> the day of Firstfruits (16 Nisan) but does not. With a Wednesday 
	crucifixion, Firstfruits (16 Nisan) will fall on Friday, meaning the resurrection 
	should also be on Friday. This however, is a day short of the 72 hour span they 
	are bound to, so they obviously can't put Firstfruits on Friday.</font></p>
	<p><u><b>Saturday Firstfruits?</font></b></u></p>
	<p>Proponents of a Wednesday crucifixion are really forced into a Saturday resurrection 
	by their maintaining strict adherence to the the 72 hour - 3 day 3 night scenario. 
	Saturday then, if it is the resurrection day, should also be the day of Firstfruits. 
	But this violates what is set forth in Lev. 23:11 which states that Firstfruits 
	occurs the day <em>after</em> the sabbath, meaning the day after the 15 Nisan 
	sabbath (1st day of Unleavened Bread, v.7). So, Firstfruits could not have been 
	on Saturday, since as indicated in the above chart, it would clearly not be<em> 
	after</em> a sabbath. So Saturday is clearly disqualified from being Firstfruits.</font></p>
	<p><u><b>Sunday Firstfruits?</font></b></u></p>
	<p>Neither by the Wednesday theory, could Firstfruits occur on Sunday, though 
	that <em>would</em> place it after a sabbath, because that again places the 
	resurrection on Sunday, which extends past the 72 hour rule they wish to adhere 
	so rigorously to (A Sunday resurrection would make it the <em>fourth</em> day 
	after the crucifixion). Proposing a Wednesday crucifixion and Sunday Firstfruits 
	means adding two days to the scenario and again denying that 16 Nisan is the 
	resurrection day and day of Firstfruits, thus <em>breaking</em> the type-antitype 
	pattern. Since Sunday cannot possibly be called &quot;the third day&quot; since 
	Jesus' crucifixion and burial under the Wednesday crucifixion theory, and can't 
	be 16 Nisan either, it must also be disqualified as the day of Firstfruits.</font></p>
	<p>It would seem to be clear that under the Wednesday crucifixion theory, Firstfruits 
	(16 Nisan) can't be fitted in anywhere and remain harmonious with scripture. 
	Therefore, this completely excludes the possibility of a Wednesday crucifixion 
	and 72 hour theory that some would promote.</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p>Those who advocate a Thursday crucifixion propose that there were back-to-back 
	Sabbaths the year of the crucifixion, as shown above. This is based on an interpretation 
	of the word &quot;Sabbath&quot; in the crucifixion narratives in its plural 
	sense, which it is proposed, indicates that there were two separate and consecutive 
	Sabbath days observed, rather than a single &quot;high&quot; Sabbath day.&nbsp; 
	This proposed chronology has several problems:</font> </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Firstfruits does not occur on 16 Nisan.</font></li>
		<li>The day following the crucifixion is not a seventh-day Sabbath, but 
		it <b><i>must</i></b> be, as established in Anchor Point #2 above.</font></li>
		<li>Scripture makes no direct mention of two consecutive Sabbath days in 
		any of the Gospel narratives.</font></li>
		<li>By Jewish reckoning (any part of a day is counted as a full day), the 
		Thursday crucifixion theory places the resurrection on the <em>fourth day,
		</em>not on the third day.</font></li>
		<li>The Jewish priesthood would deliberately delay (dehioth) the declaration 
		of the new moon (Kiddush Hachodesh) by one day in order to <i>prevent</i> 
		the inconvenience of back-to-back sabbaths. They still do this to this day.</font></li>
