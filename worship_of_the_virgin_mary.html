</center><hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4">T</font><font size="2">HE</font> most popular form of 
  idolatry that ever captivated the human heart is the worship of Mary. To the 
  unwedded priest of&nbsp; contemplative mind, Mary has every beauty, every 
  charm, every divine grace. Pure enough to be the chosen mother of that human 
  body in which Deity dwelt, unapproached in her unparalleled honors, chaste as 
  the unspotted snow; she is the queen of his imagination, the ravishing idol of 
  his heart. And as the mistress of his affections, he sings her praises, 
  proclaims her glories, and gives her glowing homage. Those who fail to worship 
  Mary, in his sight, are destitute of moral taste and perception; they are 
  blind to beauty; they are governed by heartless ingratitude; they have no ear 
  for the sweetest voice that ever fell on the ears of angels, or sent its 
  thrilling melodies through the wounds of a bleeding heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the masses of the Catholic world, Jehovah does not appear 
  as a pitying Father, governed by a compassion too vast for finite conception, 
  a love which led him to give up his only Son to the nails, the crucifix, the 
  spear, the burning wrath of indignant justice, the ghastly arms of the 
  universal destroyer, and to the loathsome grave, that &quot;he might redeem us from 
  the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.&quot; He is the awful God who 
  breathes thunders; whose eyes flash forth lightnings; whose feet, as they 
  touch our world, start the jarring earthquakes; whose voice is like the 
  roarings of many cataracts; who is holy, terribly just, sparing neither age 
  nor sex, and never appalled by the numbers who fall before his avenging 
  righteousness. Jesus is not the God-<i>man</i>. He is simply Jehovah, without 
  anything to make him our <i>brother</i>, to proclaim his intense and eternal 
  human sympathies. The only conception the Catholic masses have of Christ's 
  humanity is a</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="right">[pg. 313]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">little child sitting in helpless and unconscious innocence on 
  the knees of a loving mother; to them Jesus is the infinite God, moving 
  through the universe as its master, to inflict punishment; and to be coaxed 
  into acts of mercy by a mother whom he loves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They view Mary as the personification of maidenly modesty, of 
  motherly love, of all beauty, goodness, and gentleness. There is not a pure 
  and loving quality known to the human imagination which is not attributed to 
  Mary. She has pity in ocean fullness; she is ever ready to intercede for her 
  penitent petitioners; she has unlimited sway over the heart of her Son. She is 
  the queen of love, of goodness, and of heaven. She is the most venerated 
  divinity in the Catholic Church. Little wonder that Mohammed should say: * 
  &quot;Believe therefore, in God and his apostles, and say not there are three Gods, 
  forbear this; it will be better for you.&quot; His commentator tells us the three 
  Gods of whom he spoke were the Father, the Son and the Virgin Mary.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>The Worship of Mary began in Arabia. </i>†</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i></i>About the end of the fourth century 
  certain women in Arabia, once in twelve months, dressed a car[t] or square 
  throne; spread a linen cloth over it; and on a clear day placed a loaf of 
  bread or cakes called collyrides upon it, which they offered to the Virgin 
  Mary. It would seem that this was a transfer of the services of the Lord's 
  Supper to Mary from her Son. These first worshippers of Mary were called 
  Collyridianians. This service, though offensive to the churches at first, 
  under another and milder form spread rapidly over the East and West. ‡</p>

  Mary, pilfered from her divine Son. Not in any tongue used by mortals has such 
  a list of impious compliments been given to a woman living or dead. Nor has 
  any religion or superstition ever showered such praises upon a female 
  divinity. Every sentence is but the prayer:</p>

  <p align="center"><i>Mary and Eve, the Authors of Sin and Salvation</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev. M. Hobart Seymour, an Episcopal 
  clergyman, spent some time in Rome at the period when Puseyism [Edward 
  Bouverie Pusey, (1800 - 1882)] threatened to</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="right">[pg. 321]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">carry the Church of England into the arms of the &quot;Scarlet 
  Lady;&quot; and as it was assumed in Rome that he was there to join the Church of 
  the Dark Ages, provided some difficulties were explained, certain Professors 
  of the Collegio Romano, of the order of Jesuits, visited him repeatedly to 
  remove his objections. One of these Jesuits declared to him, * &quot;That as it was 
  a woman brought in sin, so a woman was to bring in holiness; that as a woman 
  brought in death, so a woman was to bring in life; that as Eve brought in 
  dissolution, so Mary was to bring in salvation; that as we regard Eve as the 
  first sinner, so we are to regard <i>Mary as the first Saviour;</i> the one as 
  the author of sin, the other as the author of its remedy.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>The Virgin More Merciful than her Son.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of these professors declared that the 
  &quot;feeling was universal among Romanists that the Virgin Mary was more merciful, 
  more gentle, and more ready to hear than Christ.&quot; † On another page the same 
  doctrine is taught by one of these Jesuits: &quot;It is the opinion of many of the 
  fathers that God hears our prayers more quickly when they are offered through 
  the blessed Virgin than when they are offered through anyone else.&quot; And again: 
  &quot;Many of the fathers were of the opinion that even Christ himself was not so 
  willing to hear our prayers, and did not hear them so quickly, when offered 
  simply to himself, as when they were offered through the blessed Virgin.&quot; And 
  again, the professor says: &quot;The Romanists feel Mary is altogether of their own 
  nature, and that this insures a more perfect sympathy, so as to make Mary more 
  accessible than Christ; and this feeling leads them to pray with more 
  frequency, as well as with more confidence to Mary than to Christ.&quot;</p>

  <p align="left">ing to enter heaven by Christ's ladder were constantly 
  tumbling down, and meeting with perpetual failures; those who attempted to 
  reach the skies by Mary's always succeeded, for she put forth her hands to 
  assist them. Seymour says: * &quot;I saw this as an altar-piece (a picture of it) 
  in a church at Milan—none succeeding by the Saviour's ladder, none failing by 
  the Virgin's.&quot;</p>

  the Father; at the two angles of the base are the Son and Mary; the two arms 
  of the Father resting on the heads of the Son and Mary, form the legs of the 
  triangle; while the arms of the Son, extended to the head of Mary, form the 
  base. The Sacristan called it the Trinity of the Father, Son and Virgin. †</p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i></i>To have had such a Son as Jesus is the 
  common basis of Mary's claim to the peculiar respect of our race; but the 
  Jesuits of the Collegio Romano have discovered another foundation for these 
  merits. &quot;Assuredly,&quot; says one of them, &quot;there was merit in the <i>sufferings 
  undergone by the blessed Virgin in giving birth to the child Jesus. There was 
  no necessity whatever; no reason whatever why she should have subjected 
  herself to them; </i>and therefore her having</p>

  <p align="left">actually undergone such sufferings, was meritorious. * She had 
  some claim upon God for it.&quot; Here the doctrine is that maternity inflicted on 
  Mary without her consent gave merit to her enforced sufferings. If so, then 
  every case of compelled maternity has overflowing merit to blot out the sins 
  of others, even when the mother is a heathen.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>The Religion of Italy, the Gospel of Mary, not the 
  Dispensation<br>
  of Jesus.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i></i>The intelligent observer already quoted 
  confirms the universal testimony of travellers who have visited Italy about 
  the extent of Mary worship. He says: † &quot;The whole devotional system of the 
  Church of Rome, the prayers of the Virgin, the countless images of the Virgin, 
  the many churches dedicated to the Virgin, the universal devotion rendered to 
  the Virgin, the manner in which all the services and prayers of the church and 
  people are impregnated with thoughts of the Virgin, the extent to which, in 
  conversation, all classes went, in speaking of the Virgin, all had impressed 
  me with the feeling that the religion of Italy ought to be called: <i>The 
  religion of the Virgin Mary</i>, and <i>not the religion of Jesus Christ</i>.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;If I enter the church of the Augustines, I see there an 
  image of the Virgin Mary as large as life. Some are decking her with jewels as 
  votive offerings; some are suspending pictures around as memorials of 
  thankfulness; some are placing money in a box at her feet; <i>some are 
  devoutly kissing her feet and touching them with their foreheads; some are 
  prostrate in profound devotion before her; </i>some are repeating the rosary 
  before her; all are turning their backs upon the consecrated host; upon that 
  which the priest is elevating upon the high altar, and which he and they 
  devoutly believe to be Jesus Christ Himself bodily and visibly among them; <i>
  turning their backs upon Christ and their faces upon Mary, </i>practically 
  forsaking Christ for Mary, with a prostration the most profound before her 
  image—a prostration that was never surpassed in the days of heathen Rome, and 
  can never be justified in Christian Rome.&quot; ‡</p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of these Jesuits told Mr. and Mrs. 
  Seymour, * &quot;That the devotion to the Virgin was very popular; that latterly it 
  had become increasingly so, and that he knew many facts that proved it a 
  growing devotion among all classes. He mentioned the frequency with which he 
  hears the poor and simple people praying to the Virgin, singing hymns to her 
  pictures, at the corners of the streets early in the morning, appealing to her 
  for protection in times of danger; and he narrated an instance of a little 
  child appealing to the Virgin whose piety so touched his heart that a tear 
  glistened in his eye as the told the incident.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>This Devotion rests upon the highest Authority.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i></i>The Council of Trent gave birth to modern 
  Romanism; its decisions have greater weight in the Papal Church than passages 
  of Scripture. The fathers of Trent had two classes of decrees to which they 
  gave their sanction, the first originated with themselves, the second was made 
  up of bulls, and commandments of other and commonly inferior synods. The 
  Council of Trent in its fifth session, in its articles on &quot;<a href="http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct05os.htm">Original 
  Sin</a>,&quot; adopted the following from a decree of Sixtus IV.: † &quot;When we 
  investigate with the scrutiny of devout consideration the exalted insignia of 
  the merits with which the Queen of the heavens, the glorious Virgin mother of 
  God, advanced to the celestial dwellings, shining amidst the constellations as 
  the morning star, and revolve beneath the secrets of our breast, that she <i>
  herself as the path of mercy, </i>the <i>mother of grace, </i>and the friend 
  of piety, the <i>consoler of the human race, </i>the sedulous and vigilant

  mother of grace, the consoler of the human race, with merits and intercession 
  to qualify men for divine grace; and that, by the decree of the authoritative 
  Council of Trent.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>The Catechism of the Council of Trent,</i></p>
  <p align="left">Speaks with equal significance: * &quot;Therefore, we, exiled sons 
  of Eve, who inhabit this vale of tears, ought assiduously to invoke the <i>
  Mother of Mercy, </i>and the advocate of the faithful people, that she might 
  pray for us sinners, and that from her, in prayer, we <i>might implore aid and 
  assistance; </i>for no one, unless impiously and wickedly, can doubt but that 
  she has the <i>most surpassing merits with God, </i>and the highest desire to 
  assist the human race.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>Gregory XVI., in</i> 1832,</p>
  <p align="left">Says, in his Encyclical Letter [MIRARI VOS], published August 
  15th of that year: † &quot;But that all things may have a prosperous and happy 
  issue, let us raise our eyes and hands to the most holy Virgin Mary, who only 
  destroys all heresies, who is <i>our greatest hope; </i>yea, <i>the entire 
  ground of our hope.</i>&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such is the position occupied by that modest, unassuming 
  woman, who gave birth to Jesus, in the Church of Rome. She is adored with a 
  worship of the loftiest order; she is venerated by many millions who neglect 
  her Son and his Father. She is at this moment the great divinity of the papal 
  world. Nor is there a doubt by that she would denounce this impious idolatry 
  if she were on earth, and drive her images and worshippers from every 
  Christian temple.</p>

  respected by his followers, simply as the mother of the Baptist, or any other 
  godly woman was esteemed. After his death, there is nothing in the sacred 
  records about her; nor is there one single instance, <i>in the New Testament</i>, 
  of <i>reverence, veneration, dulia, hyperdulia, or latria </i>given to Mary.

  undoubtedly hinted to him the propriety of performing a miracle. According to 
  the Vulgate, the only Bible recognized by the Council of Trent, the Saviour 
  answered: * What is it to me and thee, woman? my hour is not yet come.&quot; The 
  use of the word &quot;woman&quot; by the Saviour, does not lead one to think that he

  sinners, the comfortress of the afflicted,&quot; and he makes the declinature 
  publicly, as if to show that even his mother must not interfere with him in 
  discharging the duties he owes his Father. And he immediately rebukes the idea 
  that his mother was any more to him, as the Great Teacher, than any other 
  disciple; whosoever does his Father's will is dear to him, and powerful with 
  him, as &quot;brother, sister and mother.&quot;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>The Saviour declares that there is a greater Distinction 
  on earth<br>
  than that of being his Mother.</i></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On one occasion, while he was speaking, a 
  delighted woman, most probably a mother, exclaimed, according to the Vulgate: 
  * &quot;Blessed is the womb which bare thee, and the breasts which thou hast 
  sucked; and he said: Nay, rather, they are blessed who hear the word of God, 
  and keep it.&quot; This woman properly pronounced Mary blessed for giving birth to 
  the Redeemer. But the Saviour, while admitting that Mary had a blessing in 
  being his mother, declares that the hearing and keeping of the word of God was 
  a greater honor—a happier distinction. And if the inferior honor justifies the 
  worship of Mary, on the same principle higher worship should be given to all 
  who hear God's word and keep it. But we very much fear that if this rule was 
  observed, most of the present Catholic saints would be discarded, and millions 
  of godly persons, <i>who were never inside a Romish Church, would have their 
  images put in Catholic shrines, and prayers and devotions presented to them</i>—because 
  they heard GOD'S WORD AND KEPT IT, instead of observing the traditions of men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman so deaf that she can hear nothing, has a powerful 
  son, persons are ignorant of her deafness, and anxious for the favor of the 
  mighty son; they seek the intercession of his deaf mother. But though they 
  plead earnestly, they appeal to her in vain; she cannot hear them. In regard 
  to all earthly prayers and devotions, Mary is a deaf woman; <i>she cannot 
  hear. She knows nothing of all the words addressed to her.</i></p>

    and to their surprise they succeeded, for the Blessed Virgin stretched out 
    Her hand and with Her aid they reached Heaven.<sup>44</sup></p>
    <p>NOTE: This apparition is by no means incredible; nor is it right to say 
    that it makes the power of Mary superior to that of Christ. The symbolic 
    significance of the vision must be borne in mind. The idea has been 
    expressed repeatedly in the words of St. Bernard, and more recently by Popes 
    Leo XIII and Benedict XV: &quot;As we have no access to the Father except through 
    the Son, so no one can come to the Son except by the Mother. As the Son is 
    all-powerful by nature, the Mother is all-powerful in so far that by the 
    merciful disposition of God She is our mediatrix of graces with Christ. 
    Therefore says Eadmer: &quot;Frequently our petitions are heeded sooner when we 
    address ourselves to Mary the Queen of Mercy and Compassion than when we go 
    directly to Jesus who as King of Justice is our Judge.&quot; <sup>45</sup></p>

    <p>The White Ladder</p>
    </b>
    <p>Devotion to Mary is that white ladder seen in a celebrated vision by 
    Brother Leo of the early Franciscans. In this vision the holy friar saw an 
    immense field, and in it there were so many friars of the Order that to get 
    them all within view the throng had to extend upward. Two ladders so 
    appeared, rising into the sky, one of them red and one of them white. At the 
    top of the red one St. Francis was seen alongside Jesus, and he invited the 
    friars to mount up. The friars faithfully undertook the climb, but 
    afterwards fell back, some from the first rung, others from the second rung, 
    and others from the third. Even the few who seemed to reach the top rung 
    with great labor fell back down. Then the Seraphic Father encouraged his 
    sons, &quot;Hasten over there to the white ladder.&quot; And there, in all Her beauty, 
    the Immaculate Virgin was inviting Her protégés to climb up to Her. Then - 
    how wonderful to see it! - they all nimbly climbed the white ladder the 
    whole way to the top! It is all-important to realize then that true devotion 
    to the Madonna is the most perfect way to Jesus - the most beautiful way.</p>

    <p>Our Lady assures us of our salvation with our own cooperation in using 
    the means given to us: prayer, the sacraments, mortifications, good works, 
    and particularly Marian devotion. Even St. Francis of Assisi in the famous 
    vision of Friar Leo on the white ladder and the red ladder assures us that 
    devotion to Our Lady is a guarantee for salvation. Thus, those who were 
    saved on the white ladder at whose peak was the Blessed Virgin entered 
    heaven; those on the red ladder --what a loss!</p>

    <p><b>GENERAL AUDIENCE: MARY, MOTHER OF ALL THE REDEEMED</b></p>
    <p>VATICAN CITY, MAY 7, 1997 (VIS) - The Holy Father dedicated today's 
    general audience to the Virgin Mary, and commented on the words that Jesus 
    spoke from the Cross to St. John: &quot;'Behold your mother', ... with which he 
    reveals to the Blessed Virgin the pinnacle of her motherhood.&quot;</p>
    <p>John Paul II expressed his wish that all might discover in these words of 
    Jesus &quot;the invitation to accept Mary as their mother, responding as true 
    children to her motherly love.&quot;</p>
    <p>At the moment that Jesus entrusts his mother to St. John,
    <font color="#FF0000"><b>&quot;it is possible to understand the authentic meaning 
    of Marian worship in the ecclesial community ... which furthermore is based 
    on the will of Christ.&quot;</b></font></p>
    <p>&quot;The words 'Behold your mother',&quot; continued the Holy Father, &quot;express 
    Jesus's intention to awaken in his disciples an attitude of love and trust 
    toward Mary, leading them to recognize in her their mother, the mother of 
    all believers. In the Blessed Virgin's school, the disciples learn, as John 
    does, to know the Lord deeply&quot; and to love him.</p>
    <p>John Paul II underlined that &quot;the history of Christian piety teaches that 
    Mary is the path that leads to Christ, and that filial devotion to her does 
    not at all diminish intimacy with Jesus, but rather, it increases it and 
    leads it to very high levels of perfection.&quot;</p>
    <p>The Pope remarked that when the Gospel says that St. John welcomed Mary 
    into his house, this &quot;seems to show his initiative, full of respect and 
    love, ... to live the spiritual life in communion with her.&quot;</p>
    <p>He concluded by asking all Christians &quot;to make room (for Mary) in their 
    daily lives, acknowledging her providential role in the path of salvation.&quot;</p>
    <p>In his greetings in different languages at the end of the audience, the 
    Holy Father reminded the Slovak pilgrims that tomorrow is the liturgical 
    solemnity of the Ascension of the Lord: &quot;The eternal Son of God, who lived 
    for 33 years on Earth to be our Master and Redeemer, went up to heaven to 
    prepare a place for us.&quot;</p>

    <p>Most Holy and Immaculate Virgin! O my Mother! Thou who art the Mother of 
    my Lord, the Queen of the world, the advocate, hope, and refuge of sinners! 
    I, the most wretched among them, now come to thee. <font color="#FF0000">I worship thee, great 
    Queen,</font> and give thee thanks for the many favors thou hast bestowed on my in 
    the past; most of all do I thank thee for having saved me from hell, which I 
    had so often deserved. I love thee, Lady most worthy of all love, and, by 
    the love which I bear thee, I promise ever in the future to serve thee, and 
    to do what in me lies to win others to thy love. <font color="#FF0000">In thee I put all my trust, 
    all my hope of salvation.</font> Receive me as thy servant, and cover me with the 
    mantle of thy protection, thou who art the Mother of mercy! And since thou 
    hast so much power with God, deliver me from all temptations, or at least 
    obtain for me the grace ever to overcome them. From thee I ask a true love 
    of Jesus Christ, and the grace of a happy death. O my Mother! By thy love 
    for God I beseech thee to be at all times my helper, but above all at the 
    last moment of my life. Leave me not until thou seest me safe in heaven, 
    there for endless ages to bless thee and sing thy praises. Such is my hope.

<p align="left"><font face="Times" size="3">18. It is therefore, a pleasure for 
us, a full century having passed since the Pontiff of immortal memory, Pius IX, 
solemnly proclaimed this singular privilege of the Virgin Mother of God, to 
summarize the whole doctrinal position and conclude in these words of the same 
Pontiff, asserting that this doctrine &quot;vouched for in Sacred Scripture according 
to the interpretation of the Fathers, is handed down by them in so many of their 
important writings, is expressed and celebrated in so many illustrious monuments 
of renowned antiquity, and proposed and confirmed by the greatest and highest 
decision of the Church&quot; (Bull <i>Ineffabilis Deus</i>), so that to pastors and 
faithful <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">there is nothing &quot;more sweet, 
nothing dearer than to worship, venerate, invoke and praise with ardent 
affection the Mother of God conceived without stain of original sin.</span> (<i>Ibidem</i>.)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times" size="3">33. But where - as is the case in 
almost all dioceses, there exists a church in which
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the Virgin Mother of God is worshipped 
with more intense devotion</span>, thither on stated days let pilgrims flock 
together in great numbers and publicly and in the open give glorious expression 
to their common Faith and their common love toward the Virgin Most Holy. ...</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times" size="3">34. But let this holy 
city of Rome be the first to give the example, this city which from the earliest 
Christian era <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">worshipped the heavenly mother</span>, its patroness, with a special 
devotion. As all know, there are many sacred edifices here, in which she is 
proposed for the devotion of the Roman people; but the greatest without doubt is 
the Liberian Basilica [St. Mary Major], in which the mosaics of Our predecessor of pious memory, Sixtus III, still glisten, an outstanding monument to the Divine maternity of 
the Virgin Mary, and in which the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&quot;salvation of the Roman people&quot; (<i>Salus 
Populi Romani</i>)</span> benignly smiles.</font></p>
