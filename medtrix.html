  Affirms Mary To Be Co-redeemer!</a> (May 29th, 2002)</b></p>

  <p>There is a movement underway in the Catholic Church to have the Pope declare Mary the Co-redemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate of humanity as the 
  fifth official Marian dogma (article of faith) for Catholics. Dr. Mark 
  Miravalle of the Franciscan University of Steubenville, organizer of the &quot;Vox 
  Populi Mariae Mediatrici&quot; movement, has promoted May 31st as the appropriate 
  date for the promulgation of the dogma, which was formerly the liturgical 
  feast of Mediatrix of All Graces, established by Pope Benedict XV. </p>
  <p>For more information see the article <strong>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/LITURGY/FEAST.TXT">Marian Feasts</a>
  </strong>in the EWTN library.</p>
  <p>If proclaimed, the five Marian dogmas would then be:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; that Mary is the &quot;Mother of God&quot;<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp; that Mary was &quot;Ever-Virgin&quot;<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp; that Mary was herself &quot;immaculately conceived&quot; (without sin)<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp; that Mary was assumed into Heaven and crowned &quot;Queen of 
    Heaven and Earth&quot;<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp; that Mary is &quot;Mediatrix of all Graces, Co-redemptrix and 
    Advocate&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The August 25, 1997 edition of Newsweek magazine has a feature article on 
  the petition drive to have the Pope make the formal definition of the fifth 
  dogma. Apparently in response to the Newsweek article, a papal spokesman on 
  the 19th of August said the Pope has no plans to proclaim or even to consider 
  a new Marian dogma, and he stated that this was &quot;crystal clear.&quot;</p>
  <p>As an article of faith, the Catholic would be bound to believe an 
  ex-cathedra declaration, and would risk loss of their salvation should they 
  choose to reject the dogma. This would be because by doubting or rejecting the 
  ex-cathedra pronouncements of the Pope, they would according to Catholic 
  teaching, be rejecting the infallibly declared word of God, that has the same 
  authority as if God himself had declared it in person.</p>
  <p>By the titles of Co-redemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate, the Roman Catholic 
  Church means that salvation for <em>everyone</em> would be obtained through 
  Mary, and <em>not</em> directly from Jesus Christ. While this is in fact 
  already taught by the Catholic Church, and has been for many years, it is not 
  yet formally defined as binding dogma, though some Catholics feel it has 
  already achieved that status. Here are examples of this teaching, the first 
  two are papal encyclicals:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>5. If in all this series of Mysteries, Venerable Brethren, are developed 
    the counsels of God in regard to us -- &quot;counsels of wisdom and of 
    tenderness&quot; (St. Bernard) -- not less apparent is the greatness of the 
    benefits for which we are debtors to the Virgin Mother. No man can meditate 
    upon these without feeling a new awakening in his heart of confidence that 
    he will certainly obtain through Mary the fullness of the mercies of God. 
    And to this end vocal prayer chimes well with the Mysteries. First, as is 
    meet and right, comes the Lord's Prayer, addressed to Our Father in Heaven: 
    and having, with the elect petitions dictated by Our Divine Master, called 
    upon the Father, from the throne of His Majesty we turn our prayerful voices 
    to Mary. Thus is confirmed that law of merciful meditation of which We have 
    spoken, and which St. Bernardine of Siena thus expresses: &quot;Every grace 
    granted to man has three degrees in order; for by God it is communicated to 
    Christ, from Christ it passes to the Virgin, and from the Virgin it descends 
    to us.&quot;</p>

    wine&quot;). But it has a symbolic value: this coming to the aid of human needs 
    means, at the same time, bringing those needs within the radius of Christ's 
    messianic mission and salvific power. Thus there is a mediation: <strong>
    Mary places herself between her Son and mankind</strong> in the reality of 
    their wants, needs and sufferings. She puts herself &quot;in the middle,&quot; that is 
    to say she acts as a mediatrix not as an outsider, but in her position as 
    mother. She knows that as such she can point out to her Son the needs of 
    mankind, and in fact, she &quot;has the right&quot; to do so. Her mediation is thus in 
    the nature of intercession: Mary &quot;intercedes&quot; for mankind.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Mary's work was to be our co-redemptress, and to mediate for us together 
    with Christ, but of course in subordination to Him. He is the one principle 
    Mediator to whom we owe all. Do not be disturbed by this association of Mary 
    with the redemptive work of Christ. If all Christians are members of Christ, 
    and are called upon, as St. Paul says, to fill up what is wanting to the 
    suffering of Christ, then you can be sure that as Mary, His Mother, was more 
    closely associated with Christ than we are, so she is more closely 
    associated with His redemptive work. By a special title, therefore, we call 
    her co-redemptress. We call her &quot;Our life, or sweetness, and our hope.&quot; For, 
    in bringing forth Christ she brought forth us to life, she is the model of 
    every virtue, and above all should be the glory of all women; and she is our 
    hope as Eve was our despair. All this tells us what she is for. She is our 
    spiritual Mother in heaven, and she fulfills the duties of a Mother, winning 
    for us by her intercession that grace of Christ which is life to our souls 
    and which, please God, will mean eternal life in the end.</p>

  a general

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">4. <b>The heavenly Father wanted to place Mary close to Christ</b> 
    and in communion with him who can &quot;save those who draw near to God through 
    him, since he always lives to make intercession for them&quot; (Heb 7:25):
    <b>he 
    wanted to unite to the Redeemer’s intercession as a priest that of the 
    Blessed Virgin as a mother.</b> It is a role she carries out for the sake of 
    those who are in danger and who need temporal favours and, especially, 
    eternal salvation: &quot;By her maternal charity, she cares for the brethren of 
    her Son, who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties, 
    until they are led into their blessed home. Therefore the Blessed Virgin is 
    invoked in the Church under the titles of Advocate, Helper, Benefactress and 
    Mediatrix&quot; (<i><a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html">Lumen

  </blockquote>
  <p>At his October 1st general audience held in St. 
  Peter's Square, Pope John Paul II said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1. Among the titles attributed to Mary in the Church’s 
    devotion, chapter eight of <i>
    <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html">
    Lumen gentium</a> </i>recalls that of &quot;Mediatrix&quot;. Although some Council 
    Fathers did not fully agree with this choice of title (cf. <i>Acta Synodalia
    </i>III, 8, 163-164), it was nevertheless inserted into the Dogmatic 
    Constitution on the Church as confirmation of the value of the truth it 
    expresses. Care was therefore taken not to associate it with any particular 
    theology of mediation, but merely to list it among Mary’s other recognized 
    titles.</p>
    <p align="left">Moreover the conciliar text had already described the 
    meaning of the title &quot;Mediatrix&quot; when it said that Mary &quot;by her manifold 
    intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation&quot; (<i><a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html">Lumen 
    gentium</a>, </i>n. 62).</p>
    <p align="left">...</p>
  <p>4. ... In proclaiming Christ the one mediator (cf. 1 Tm 2:5-6), the text of 
  St Paul’s Letter to <b>Timothy excludes any other parallel mediation, but not 
  subordinate mediation.</b> In fact, before emphasizing the one exclusive mediation 
  of Christ, the author urges &quot;that supplications prayers, intercessions and 
  thanksgivings be made for all men&quot; (2:1). Are not prayers a form of mediation? 
  Indeed, according to St Paul, the unique mediation of Christ is meant to 
  encourage other dependent, ministerial forms of mediation. By proclaiming the 
  uniqueness of Christ’s mediation, the Apostle intends only to exclude any 
  autonomous or rival mediation, and not other forms compatible with the 
  infinite value of the Saviour’s work.</p>

  <p>Pope John Paul II was very much a champion of Mary. On May 13, 1981 you will 
  recall, there was an assassination attempt made on John Paul II in St. Peter's 
  square. Interestingly enough, that date also commemorates the first appearance 
  of the apparition of 
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b>
  <a href="http://www.fatima.org/">Our Lady of Fatima</a> </b>in 1917 in 
  Portugal. <em>John Paul II credits his survival of the assassination attempt 
  to the direct intervention of Mary!</em> On the following May 13th after his 
  recovery, in 1982, the Pope made a pilgrimage to Fatima to worship at the 
  shrine dedicated to Mary to express his thanks to her for saving his life!</p>
  <p>It is quite likely, in my humble opinion, that this petition request to 
  elevate belief in Mary as Co-redemptrix, Mediatrix and Advocate of humanity, 
  to the level of dogma and an article of faith, will indeed succeed and be the 
  crowning act of antichrist apostasy by the Catholic Church!</p>
