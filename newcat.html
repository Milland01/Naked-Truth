to be saved!</font></strong></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>841</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>The Church's relationship with
    the Muslims.</em> &quot;The plan of salvation also includes those who
    acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims;
    these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore
    the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day.&quot;[330]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This paragraph essentially proclaims that &quot;the plan of salvation&quot;
  includes all faiths that acknowledge the true creator. The reasoning given is
  that since the Muslims claim the faith of Abraham, and worship the one true
  God, they are not only among the saved, but are at the top of any such list.</p>
  <p>In preceding paragraphs (839, 840) the Jews are discussed, and parallels
  drawn between Christians and Jews. Both it is said, are awaiting the advent of
  the Messiah, though the Jews do so in unbelief relative to Jesus.</p>
  <p>Footnote 330 directs one to <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b><a

  November 21, 1964, section 16:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>16. ... But the plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the
    Creator. In the first place amongst these there are the Mohamedans, who,
    professing to hold the faith of Abraham, along with us adore the one and
    merciful God, who on the last day will judge mankind.</p>

  <i><a
  href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_nostra-aetate_en.html"><b>NOSTRA
  AETATE</b></a>, (DECLARATION ON THE RELATION OF THE CHURCH TO NON-CHRISTIAN
  RELIGIONS), </i>POPE PAUL VI, October 28, 1965, section 3:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>3. The Church regards with esteem also the Moslems. They adore the one
    God, living and subsisting in Himself; merciful and all-powerful, the
    Creator of heaven and earth,(5) who has spoken to men; they take pains to
    submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with
    whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.
    Though they do not acknowledge Jesus as God, they revere Him as a prophet.
    They also honor Mary, His virgin Mother; at times they even call on her with
    devotion. In addition, they await the day of judgment when God will render
    their deserts to all those who have been raised up from the dead. Finally,
    they value the moral life and worship God especially through prayer,
    almsgiving and fasting.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These statements&nbsp; regarding the Muslims also apply exactly and
  identically to the Jews. The implication made in paragraph 841 of the
  catechism is that in addition to the Muslims, which are just the first
  example, the Jews also are saved by their recognition and worship of the true
  creator and their Abrahamic faith.</p>
  <p>This has a very obvious flaw if you believe in the Bible at all. I will
  quote just three of the applicable passages:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 4:10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that
    by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised
    from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.<br>
    Acts 4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which
    is become the head of the corner.<br>
    Acts 4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other
    name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
    <p>Rom 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
    shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
    shalt be saved.</p>
    <p>1 John 4:14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
    to be the Saviour of the world.<br>
    1 John 4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
    dwelleth in him, and he in God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For both those of the Jewish and Muslim faiths, this element of faith in
  Jesus Christ as the raised Son of God is decidedly lacking. However, the Roman
  Catholic Church has taken it upon themselves to boldly proclaim that faith in
  Jesus Christ is not required, one only needs to believe in the creator and
  have Abraham's faith.</p>
  <p>According to the opening letter of approval from the Pope, this new
  Catechism was six years in the making, and was drafted by a commission of 12
  Cardinals and Bishops and reviewed by all the Bishops of the Catholic Church.
  I have to conclude that paragraph 841 is not misworded or a typographical
  error of some kind.</p>
  <p>Essentially, what the Roman Catholic Church is doing in paragraph 841, is
  denying that Jesus Christ is the only way to Salvation, in direct
  contradiction to the Bible. If this is true then I ask you, can anything be
  more Antichrist than this? Note what then follows in the Catholic Catechism:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;<strong>Outside the Church there is no salvation</strong>&quot;<br>
    <br>
    <strong>846</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are we to understand this
    affirmation, often repeated by the Church Fathers?[335] Re-formulated
    positively, it means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through
    the Church which is his Body: Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the
    Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for
    salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is
    present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly
    asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the
    same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as
    through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic
    Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either
    to enter it or to remain in it.[336]</p>
    <p><strong>847</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This affirmation is not
    aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and
    his Church: Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel
    of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart,
    and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it
    through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal
    salvation.[337]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, according to the Catholic Catechism, Muslims and Jews will be saved <em>despite</em>
  their rejection of Jesus Christ as the Savior (839-841), and the ignorant can
  be saved despite their ignorance of Jesus Christ (847), but Protestant
  Christians who are dedicated Christians that know and accept Jesus Christ as
  their Savior, yet stubbornly and &quot;knowingly&quot; refuse to become
  Catholics, are heretics<em> and cannot possibly be saved</em>!</p>
