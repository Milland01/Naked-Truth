  <center><b><font size="6">Answers To Questions From A Roman Catholic</font></b></center>
  <hr>
  <p>The following email was received from a Roman Catholic, and the points it
  raises should be of interest to both Protestant and Catholic readers. First
  the email is presented in its entirety, and then what follows is my response
  to each of the points raised. (The Catholic who submitted these questions has
  requested anonymity.)</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%" bgcolor="#ECF0FF">&nbsp;
          <blockquote>
            <p>I was just at you website, got there by accident, I was looking
            for some relevant information on Pope Innocent III and you site
            popped up. Boy was I surprised.</p>
            <p>So I thought I would write you back and ask you some questions. I
            hope in the interest of Charity that you take the time to be honest
            and answer them. I'm sure that if you really think everyone who dies
            not believing what you are teaching never sees God then you will
            certainly want to help me by answering my questions. Or is it that
            you believe the only ones who are for certain never going to see God
            are Roman Catholics?</p>
            <p>Of course if you don't answer my questions then I will assume you
            don't really believe what you teach on your website. In which case I
            will be forced so send some emails to the people you have links to,
            letting them know you don't really believe what you teach.</p>
            <p>So anyway, here are my questions:</p>
            <p>1. What is &quot;teaching authority&quot;?</p>
            <p>2. Do &quot;Bible Believing Christians&quot; claim teaching
            authority?<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) If you don't claim teaching authority then why
            do you have a website that tells people what certain bible passages
            really mean.</p>
            <p>3. Where does the bible say that your church and or church
            members are the only ones that can tell the true sense of the bible?</p>
            <p>3a. Is there a (singular) true sense of the bible? Or does God
            equivocate?</p>
            <p>4. It appears you subscribe to Sola Scriptura which forbids
            submission to any external teaching authority which must also mean
            that no-one may claim authority over anyone else so as to direct
            them how to believe something, would you say that is correct?</p>
            <p>5. If you are in keeping with other Sola Scriptura types in that
            reading the bible is necessary for salvation then what happened to
            those who, being born blind before the invention of Braille, could
            do nothing but hear someone else read them the bible? [since Sola
            Scriptura says reading is absolutely necessary for salvation, I
            guess this means you believe God made people specifically to go to
            Hell.]</p>
            <p>6. What happened if these blind people disagreed with the readers
            interpretation of scripture? [i.e did they go to Hell?]</p>
            <p>7. Who had the authority to teach Sola Scriptura in the first
            place? [Since &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; forbids teaching authority
            it becomes a self defeating argument. The minute you teach it you've
            denied it]</p>
            <p>8. Where does the bible say revelation was completed with the
            death of the last Apostle (St. John the Evangelist)? And if the
            bible doesn't say that revelation was completed at the death of St.
            John how can you know (with certainty) except by some extra biblical
            authority that revelation ceased with his death? (Maybe the Church
            :) )</p>
            <p>9. Where within the bible does it say which books belong to the
            Bible? remember is has to be in the bible or else you can't state
            it. So you need to show me a list of names, so that I can know for
            CERTAIN that the books of the bible are in fact the books of the
            bible.</p>
            <p>10. Why is the bible always straightforward when your doctrines
            are being explained (taught) yet when something as simple as
            &quot;This is MY BODY&quot; or &quot;Thou are Peter and upon this
            rock I shall build my church&quot; ( singular visible church I might
            add) is brought up &quot;Bible Believing Christians&quot;
            equivocate, stumble, add words to Our Lord's statements or better
            yet invent all new theology (which by the way Sola Scriptura forbids
            you from doing)?</p>
            <p>11. Where in the bible does it say which version of the bible is
            the correct version?</p>
            <p>12. What did &quot;Bible Believing Christians&quot; read before
            the &quot;reformers&quot; got there fingers on the bible?</p>
            <p>Remember all you answers must be biblical, anything else and you
            are teaching and I would, according to Sola Scriptura, be a fool for
            allowing any person to teach me anything. At least that's what you
            call Roman Catholics who submit to authority external from
            themselves and there own ideas of what the bible says.</p>
            <p>If, however, you don't answer all my questions biblically then
            you do not &quot;believe&quot; the bible alone is enough. You
            suppose it and think it, but you do not BELIEVE it! And what's more
            it means the bible alone isn't enough and that we as fallen
            creatures need an external visible teacher. Now where is that
            teacher except in the Catholic Church?</p>
            <p>As a matter of definition &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; absolutely
            forbids you from doing anything other then opening the bible and
            reading it to yourself you cannot do anything more then that. You
            may not speak, write, promote, distribute or in anyway express
            anything alluding to anything biblical because by doing that you are
            teaching and, since according to the Sola Scriptura doctrine no one
            has teaching authority, you become a hypocrite.</p>
            <p>And if &quot;Sola Scriptura&quot; doesn't mean what I say it
            means, prove me wrong, state some higher authority then my own
            personal belief about your doctrine. Since personal interpretation
            of everything is what Sola Scriptura is all about then I am, by your
            standards, completely competent to interpret doctrine and judge your
            words according to my own interpretation of Sola Scriptura. Is this
            not the authority you claim over the Catholic Church?</p>
            <p>There is as St. Paul said &quot;One Lord, One Faith, One
            Baptism&quot; and its not that Seventh-Day nonsense.</p>
            <p>Repent and return to the church of your baptism. The One, Holy,
            Catholic and Apostolic Church of Rome, outside of which no one at
            all is saved. (of course if you weren't baptized with the words
            &quot;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
            Ghost&quot; then you weren't even baptized. In which case it would
            be impossible for you to return to a church you were never a member
            of.)</p>
            <p>So if you are honest and truth seeking rather the Glory seeking
            (human glory that is) you will answer my questions without
            equivocation and maybe do some thinking about the lies you are
            spreading. Otherwise to continue on the path you have chosen is
            folly and will with certainty lead to the eternal loss of your soul.</p>
            <p>In Jesus and Mary,</p>

  <p>This subtly implies that I need to change from the dishonesty of my web
  site and give straight honest answers. This is known as an ad hominem, an
  attack on the integrity of the individual. This is frequently the tactic of
  those who cannot make their case on the merits of facts alone, and so resort
  to innuendo, name calling and personal attacks.</p>

  <p>Nowhere on my web site do I say all Catholics are going to hell, or that

  an assumption on your part, and a misrepresentation of what I believe.</p>

  <p>First ad hominem, then misrepresentation, and now a threat. Whether I
  answer your questions or not has no bearing what-so-ever on the validity of
  the material presented on my web site, or whether or not I believe it to be
  true. You seem determined to paint me as a liar who is knowingly propagating
  falsehoods about the Catholic Church. Protestants, it seems, are incapable of
  honesty and integrity, they are virtues to be found only in Roman Catholics. I
  will let the reader judge the merits of this approach.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#ECF0FF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">So anyway, here are my questions:
          <p>1. What is &quot;teaching authority&quot;?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>The Catholic sense of this question needs to be understood. The only living
  teaching authority recognized by Catholics is called the Magisterium, which is
  the Bishops of the Catholic Church in union with the Pope, the supposed
  apostolic successor to Peter, who was allegedly given his office of authority
  in Matt. 16:18,19. This Magisterium claims the ability to teach on matters of
  faith and morals without error, which is to say, infallibly.<br>
  See <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
  href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc.htm"><b>Catechism of the Catholic Church</b></a>,
  paragraphs 85-87, 888-892, 2032-2040.</p>
  <p>To the Catholic then, teaching authority is a matter of genealogy, or
  apostolic succession, where God has designated a perpetual line of infallible
  teachers, having absolute and unquestionable god-like authority.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 20:25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, <font color="#FF0000">Ye
    know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
    that are great exercise authority upon them.</font><br>
    Mat 20:26 <font color="#FF0000"><b>But it shall not be so among you:</b> but
    whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</font><br>
    Mat 20:27 <font color="#FF0000">And whosoever will be chief among you, let
    him be your servant:</font><br>
    Mat 20:28 <font color="#FF0000">Even as the Son of man came not to be
    ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#ECF0FF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">2. Do &quot;Bible Believing Christians&quot; claim
          teaching authority?<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) If you don't claim teaching authority then why
          do you have a website that tells people what certain bible passages
          really mean.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>No, I know of no Protestant Christians who claim to have &quot;teaching
  authority&quot; in the Catholic sense of the phrase, meaning absolute
  doctrinal infallibility derived from a genealogy of apostolic succession back
  to Peter. The apostle Paul actually speaks <i>against </i>such apostolic
  elitism:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 1:12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and
    I of Apollos; and I of Cephas [Peter]; and I of Christ.<br>
    1 Cor 1:13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye
    baptized in the name of Paul?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In spite of Paul's criticism of this mentality, the Roman Catholic Church
  declares <i>we are the Church of Peter, and we are the only true church</i>.
  This surely reached its zenith with the following declaration of Pope Boniface
  VIII:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary
    for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman
    Pontiff.</p>
    <p>Source: Papal Bull <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b><a
    href="http://www.saint-mike.org/Library/Papal_Library/BonifaceVIII/Unam_Sanctam.html"><i>Unam
    Sanctam</i></a></b>, by Pope Boniface VIII, 1302.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This declaration distills Roman Catholicism into one sentence, its very
  essence, and yet does it not contradict, in the most flagrant manner, the
  scriptures already cited? Even Jesus Christ had to deal with the Apostles and
  the authority they exercised over others in presumption:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 9:38 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out
    devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he
    followeth not us.<br>
    Mark 9:39 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do
    a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.<br>
    Mark 9:40 For he that is not against us is on our part.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Christ rebuked presumptuous attempts at authority over others by the
  Apostles.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#ECF0FF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">3. Where does the bible say that your church and or

      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>This again presumes that infallibility has been bestowed on some
  denomination. Scripture nowhere does this, not even to the Catholic Church. I
  would maintain that <i>any</i> denomination has an equal opportunity to
  discern the truth of scripture, and teach it. But as with the Catholic Church,
  many Protestant denominations are bound more by Catholic Tradition than by
  what Scripture teaches. The keeping of Sunday and infant baptism are two
  examples.</p>

    <center>

    bgcolor="#ECF0FF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">3a. Is there a (singular) true sense of the bible? Or

    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Scripture can be relied upon to infallibly teach true doctrine. This is not
  a guarantee, however, that everyone reading the Bible will come to the same
  conclusion. Again, the examples of Sunday holiness and infant baptism are no
  where taught in scripture, yet they are practiced by the vast majority of
  Christendom as if a &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; for them could be found in
  Scripture. Christ Himself amply explained that there are those who will
  understand His teaching and there are those who will not:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
    unto them in parables?<br>
    Mat 13:11 He answered and said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Because it
    is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to
    them it is not given.</font><br>
    Mat 13:12 <font color="#FF0000">For whosoever hath, to him shall be given,
    and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
    taken away even that he hath.</font><br>
    Mat 13:13 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore speak I to them in parables:
    because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they
    understand.</font><br>
    Mat 13:14 <font color="#FF0000">And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
    Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and
    seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</font><br>
    Mat 13:15 <font color="#FF0000">For this people's heart is waxed gross, and
    their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
    time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should
    understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal
    them.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From this passage it is clear that not everyone will understand the word of
  God, because not everyone wants to know the truth. Some would rather cling to
  traditions of men they find more to their liking. What of those sincere people
  who want to know the truth, will they find it?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:7 <font color="#FF0000">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
    ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</font><br>
    Mat 7:8 <font color="#FF0000">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he
    that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</font></p>
    <p>John 8:31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, <font
    color="#FF0000">If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</font><br>
    John 8:32 <font color="#FF0000">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth
    shall make you free.</font></p>
    <p>John 10:27 <font color="#FF0000">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
    and they follow me:</font></p>
  </blockquote>

    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="90%"
    bgcolor="#ECF0FF">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">4. It appears you subscribe to Sola Scriptura which
          forbids submission to any external teaching authority which must also
          mean that no-one may claim authority over anyone else so as to direct

      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>So, am I setting myself up as a Pope over others?</p>
  <p>Sola Scriptura recognizes the inspired Scriptures as the highest authority,
  the only infallible teacher for Christian doctrine, which is to say it rejects
  the unbiblical Traditions of men as an infallible teacher. As Martin Luther
  said before the Diet of Worms:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I cannot submit my faith either to the pope or to the councils, because
    it is clear as the day that they have frequently erred and contradicted each
    other. Unless therefore I am convinced by the testimony of Scripture or by
    the clearest reasoning, unless I am persuaded by means of the passages I
    have quoted, and unless they thus render my conscience bound by the word of
    God, I cannot and I will not retract, for it is unsafe for a Christian to
    speak against his conscience.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Luther had rejected the presumed authority of Pope and Councils, but stated
  that he would be subject to the testimony and authority scripture. This did <i>not</i>
  put Luther in the position of Pope or Councils over others. Sola Scriptura
  does not in any way setup an individual or council in Protestantism equivalent
  to the Magisterium, having in themselves a preeminent unquestionable
  infallible teaching authority. That doctrinal authority is the written word of
  God, scripture, <i>not</i> the messenger who delivers it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Tim 2:15 Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
    needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.<br>
    2 Tim 2:16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto
    more ungodliness.<br>
    2 Tim 2:17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus
    and Philetus;<br>
    2 Tim 2:18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection
    is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As the above passage demonstrates, Scripture, the word of God, is the
  remedy to false teaching, and one needs to study it diligently in order to
  rightly determine its meaning.</p>

  <p>Nothing could more absurd. Sola Scriptura does not demand that one must
  read scripture in order for the principle to be in effect. This is called a
  strawman, a misrepresentation of an opposing point of view in order to make it
  look preposterous and easily confute it. Sola Scriptura only limits dogmatic
  teaching to the doctrines taught by Scripture, it <i>does not</i> demand that
  everyone must read scripture themselves in order to be saved. One who is
  illiterate, or blind, or deaf, need only be taught scriptural doctrines, by <i>whatever
  means</i>, in order for Sola Scripture to be in practice. Sola Scriptura does
  not regulate the mode of transmission, only the doctrinal content.</p>

  <p>Sola Scriptura limits infallible teaching to that taught by the inspired
  written word of God. It in no way limits <i>anyone</i> from expounding on the
  true meaning and intent of Scripture to others. To suggest that it does, is a
  Catholic misrepresentation of the principle, merely another flimsy strawman.</p>
  <p>The authority of Scripture for doctrine is taught in the Old Testament:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
    this word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The preeminent teacher of Sola Scriptura was Christ Himself, who rejected
  the religious Traditions of men that nullified the word of God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 7:9 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Full well ye reject
    the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 7:13 <font color="#FF0000">Making the word of God of none effect
    through your tradition, which ye have delivered:<br>
    and many such like things do ye.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The apostles themselves taught the sufficiency of Scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Tim 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
    which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in
    Christ Jesus.<br>
    2 Tim 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
    for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:<br>
    2 Tim 3:17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all
    good works.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This raises the question, what does the man of God lack if he knows
  Scripture? If one is &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;thoroughly furnished unto
  all good works&quot; as a Christian, what need has he of unbiblical Roman
  Catholic Traditions for the task set before him, that being to preach the
  Gospel message? Does Scripture anywhere else claim to be sufficient to
  salvation?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 20:30 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
    disciples, which are not<br>
    written in this book:<br>
    John 20:31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
    Christ, the Son of God; and<br>
    that believing ye might have life through his name.</p>

  <p>Before, and during the Reformation, the Catholic Church made it as
  difficult as possible for anyone to have unrestricted access to the Bible. If
  you did not know Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, there was virtually no chance of
  being able to read the Bible in your own language. This put the Latin speaking
  clergy of the Catholic Church in a position of authority over the teaching and
  interpretation of Scripture.&nbsp; The Protestant reformers sought to rectify
  this situation at any expense, even at the cost of their lives. Publishing the
  Bible in the common tongue by Protestants had the automatic result of
  diminishing the &quot;teaching authority&quot; of the Roman Catholic
  priesthood. No longer did the layman need to rely on the priest, he could read
  the word of God for himself. As a result of being able to read scripture, it
  became obvious that the Church had fallen into apostasy and corruption, and
  was teaching for doctrine the Traditions of men. This the Catholic Church
  would not tolerate, and made every effort to suppress these Bibles, and the
  men who translated, printed, or possessed them.</p>

  <p><b><u>Paul the seventh-day Sabbath keeper</u></b></p>
  <p>Acts 13, beginning with verse 14, testifies that Paul exercised his
  &quot;teaching authority&quot; only on the Sabbath day, and <i>not</i> on
  Sunday:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 13:14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in
    Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</p>
    <p>Acts 13:16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of
    Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</p>
    <p>Acts 13:42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
    besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</p>
    <p>Acts 13:44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together
    to hear the word of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Why did the Gentiles, indeed the whole city, have to wait until the <i>next
  Sabbath day </i>to hear Paul preach again? Why didn't Paul meet with them and
  preach to them the very next day, Sunday? Simple. Because Paul knew nothing of
  keeping Sunday, not even with Gentiles. Consequently everyone waited until the
  next seventh-day Saturday Sabbath. Sunday was clearly not a day the Apostles
  kept as a holy day.</p>
  <p><b><u>The Apostolic Church did not baptize infants.</u></b></p>
  <p>Baptism followed repentance and faith, something an infant cannot do:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 1:4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
    repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
    <p>Luke 3:3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the
    baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</p>
    <p>Acts 13:24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
    repentance to all the people of Israel.</p>
    <p>Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of
    you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall
    receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p>Acts 19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
    repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which
    should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p>
    <p>Mat 28:19 <font color="#FF0000">Go ye therefore, and </font>[1]<font
    color="#FF0000"> teach all nations, </font>[2]<font color="#FF0000">
    baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
    Ghost:</font><br>
    Mat 28:20 <font color="#FF0000">Teaching them to observe all things
    whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the
    end of the world.</font> Amen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I submit that a Church that claims to be apostolic, but baptizes infants,
  and keeps Sunday rather than the Sabbath, cannot be an infallible teacher of
  Christian doctrine, since it plainly abandons the pure teaching of the
  Apostles for the corrupted traditions of men. These are not the only examples

  willing to acknowledge. Heaven will not be exclusively for the followers of
  Peter's alleged successors, neither will it be populated solely by followers
  of Luther, or Calvin, or any other Protestant. Heaven will be <i>inclusive</i>
  of all those who put their trust in Jesus Christ, and accept His death on the
  cross to pay for their sins. By that faith, they will be resurrected from
  death unto life eternal. That is the simplicity of the Gospel message that
  scripture teaches effectively and <i>completely</i>.</p>
