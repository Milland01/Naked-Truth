<p align="center"><b><font size="6">Exactly Which Pope<br>
Changed The Sabbath To Sunday?<br>
</font><font size="4">A Challenge To Adventists Answered.</font></b></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I saw that the Sabbath commandment was not nailed to the cross.
If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to
break them all, as well as to break the fourth. I saw that God had not
changed the Sabbath, for He never changes. But the pope had changed it
from the seventh to the first day of the week; for he was to change
times and laws [Daniel 7:25]. -- Ellen White, <i>A word to the Little
Flock, </i>page 18, paragraph 3, and <i>Early Writings,</i> page 32,
paragraph 3.</p>
    <p><span class="text" field="text">The pope has changed the day of
rest from the seventh to the first day. </span>-- Ellen White, <i>Early
Writings,</i> page 65, paragraph 1.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above quotes have been the subject of a challenge to
Adventists on the internet recently. Actually, it is no small matter,
as the issue involves a prominent characteristic of Daniel's little
horn power, also known in Revelation as the mark of the beast, that
stands in direct opposition to the seal of God. Here are excerpts from
challenges that have suggested the above statements about a Pope to be
error:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><b>Challenge 1</b></u></p>
    <p>The Seventh-day Adventist hierarchy, knowing that since White
claimed she received this information in a vision from God, and knowing
that God could not have provided false information, tried for years to
produce proof of a name and date of a Pope that had mandated the change
of the Sabbath day. Unfortunately since what ever date that they
provide to "prove" when the Sabbath was "changed," it can be shown that
communities worshipped regularly on Sunday prior to this date--all the
way up to Apostolic Times.&nbsp; Further, no documentation has been
found to document that a Pope changed the Sabbath as is specified in
this prophesy of Ellen White since the teaching does come from
Apostolic Times.</p>

    <p>Ellen White would have defined the term "the pope" differently
to Catholics - she would likely have meant someone other than the
Apostle Peter, someone who lived much later in Christian history. She
should name him, and she does not. See also the Catholic Insight web

    <p>That IS interesting :-&gt; Certainly it shows that they are
prepared to make claims, but can't give details when the claims are
questioned by informed questioners.</p>

        <td width="100%"><a
 href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12617a.htm"> Rabanus Maurus</a>
(776-856), abbot of Fulda and later archbishop of Mainz, Germany, was
rated one of the greatest theologians of his age and probably the most
cultured man of his time, and exceptionally learned in patristics.
Besides, he was a zealous defender of the papacy and its teachings. In
one of his works, he says,
        <blockquote>
          <p>Pope Sylvester instructed the clergy to keep the <i>feriae</i>.
And, indeed, from an old custom he called the first day [of the week]
the "Lord's [day]," on which the light was made in the beginning and
also the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.<sup>6</sup></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Rabanus Maurus does not mean to say that Sylvester was the
first man who referred to the days of the week as <i>feriae</i> or who
first started the observance of Sunday among Christians. He means that,
according to the testimony of Roman Catholic writers, Sylvester
confirmed those practices and made them official insofar as his church
was concerned. Hence Rabanus says elsewhere in his writings:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Pope Sylvester first among the Romans ordered that the
names of the days [of the week], which they previously called after the
name of their gods, that is, [the day] of the Sun, [the day] of the
Moon, [the day] of Mars, [the day] of Mercury, [the day] of Jupiter,
[the day] of Venus, [the day] of Saturn, they should call <i>feriae</i>
thereafter, that is the first <i>feria, </i>the second <i>feria, </i>the
third <i> feria, </i>the fourth <i>feria, </i>the fifth <i>feria, </i>the
sixth <i>feria,</i> because that in the beginning of Genesis it is
written that God said concerning each day: on the first, "Let there be
light:; on the second, "Let there be a firmament"; on the third, "Let
the earth bring forth verdure"; etc. But he [Sylvester] ordered [them]
to call the Sabbath by the ancient term of the law, [to call] the first
          <i>feria</i> the "Lord's day," because on it the Lord rose
[from the dead], Moreover, the same pope decreed that the rest of the
Sabbath should be transferred rather to the Lord's day [Sunday], in
order that on that day we should rest from worldly works for the praise
of God.<sup>7</sup></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note particularly, he says that "the same pope [Sylvester I]
decreed that the rest of the Sabbath should be transferred rather to
the Lord's day [Sunday]."<sup>8</sup> According to this statement, he
was the first bishop to introduce the idea that the divinely appointed
rest of the Sabbath day should be transferred to the first day of the
week. This is significant, especially in view of the fact that it was
during Sylvester's pontificate that the emperor of Rome [Constantine]
issued the first civil laws compelling men to rest from secular labor
on Sunday, and that Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, was the first
theologian on record to present arguments, allegedly from the
Scriptures, that Christ did transfer the rest of the Sabbath day to
Sunday.</p>

  <p><font size="3"><i>Patrologia Latina</i> was first published from
1844 to 1855, so it is evident that long standing historical proof does
in fact exist, and that Ellen White (1827-1915) was likely aware that
the information was contained in <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, though she
apparently never cited it (MPL) in her writings. Note that she also
knew the bishop of Rome had deemed Sunday to be the Lord's day:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="text" field="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Constantine, while still a heathen, issued a decree enjoining the
general observance of Sunday as a public festival throughout the Roman
empire. After his conversion, he remained a staunch advocate of Sunday,
and his pagan edict was then enforced by him in the interests of his
new faith. But the honor shown this day was not as yet sufficient to
prevent Christians from regarding the true Sabbath as the holy of the
Lord. Another step must be taken; the false Sabbath must be exalted to
an equality with the true. A few years after the issue of Constantine's
decree, the bishop of Rome conferred on the Sunday the title of Lord's
day. Thus the people were gradually led to regard it as possessing a
degree of sacredness. Still the original Sabbath was kept. -- </span>Ellen
White<span class="text" field="text">, <i>Spirit of Prophecy</i>,
Volume 4, 1884, pg. 55.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">That bishop of Rome was, of course, Sylvester I, as
  </font> Bede and Rabanus Maurus confirm<font size="3">. Cardinal
Humbert of France quoted Sylvester's low opinion of the Sabbath:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"If every Lord's day is to be observed joyfully by the
Christians on account of the resurrection, then every Sabbath on
account of the burial is detestably Jewish. <font class="arttext"><font
 face="Times New Roman">In fact all the disciples of the Lord lamented </font><font
 face="Times-Roman">on the Sabbath, bewailing the buried Lord, and the
Jews exulted. But sadness reigned for the fasting apostles. In like
manner we are sad, saddened by the burial of the Lord, and rejoice with
them in the Lord’s resurrection. N</font><font face="Times New Roman">either
in fact is it proper to feast [on the Sabbath] as the Jewish custom
observed by the Jews."</font></font></p>
    <p>Ex quorum numero beatissimus papa Silvester, magni Constantini
Augusti spiritualis pater, inter alia dixit :&nbsp; &lt; Si omnis
Dominicus dies resurrectionis gratia est colendus in gaudio
Christianorum : omnis ergo sabbati dies sepulturae deputandus est in
exsecratione Judaerorum. Omnis enim discipuli Domini Sabbato fletum
habuerunt, sepultum Dominum suspirantes, et Judaeis exulantibus
laetitia inerat. Apostolis autem jejunantibus tristitia imperabat.
Tristemur itaque cum tristantibus de sepultura Domini, si volumus cum
iisdem de Domini resurrectione gaudere. Neque enim fas est
destructiones ciborum et caerimonias Judaeorum more Judaico observemus.

    <p align="left">In the 14th century, Pope John XXII commissioned Agostino Trionfo of Ancona (Augustinus Triumphus 1243-1328 A.D.) to
produce a book that would set forth and defend the ecclesiastical and
temporal authority of the papacy. The result was <i>Summa de potestate
ecclesiastica</i>, which was completed in the year 1320, dedicated to
the same Pope, and published from 1320 to 1584. In Question 50 (L) of <i>Summa</i>
regarding the Third Commandment ( TERTII PRAECEPTI ), the statement was
made that "The Pope has changed the law of the Sabbath day to the
Lord's day". </p>
	<p align="left">So for those 264 years, the Catholic Church was crediting the
papacy with making the change. <img src="star.gif" border="0"

- 666, The Number of the Beast</b>.</a></p>
  <p><font size="3">Interestingly enough, it is even boasted on Roman
Catholic web sites that Pope Sylvester I made the change to the Sunday
Sabbath! The following screen capture is from the <a

<p align="center">

<blockquote>
  <p>Then there was this at another Catholic site:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Pope Sylvester I also is known for instituting Sunday as a holy
day in memory of the Resurrection, and for creating the "Iron Cross"
with a nail from the Holy Cross. He was the first pope to wear the
tiara.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>So while some Roman Catholics were suggesting on the internet that
Adventists simply could not prove that a Pope made a change to Sunday,
other Roman Catholics were openly proclaiming that Pope Sylvester I had
done the deed!</p>
  <p>Now I think this is very curious. Surely neither Odom's <i>Sabbath
and Sunday in Early Christianity</i> or the Adventist's <i>Bible
Student's Source Book</i> are the source of information for the
Catholic web sites, so there must be Catholic source information that
credits Pope Sylvester I for decreeing a change to Sunday rest. It can
be found in a <a

  <p>It should also be noted that Pope Sylvester did not invent Sunday
worship, and neither did Emperor Constantine, and Adventists do not
make that claim. But, it is evident to everyone that a change did
happen to keeping Sunday instead of the Saturday Sabbath. Adventists
have been well aware that celebrating the resurrection on Sundays
predates the 4th century, though there is no <i>biblical</i> proof
that the Apostles ever sanctioned a change of the Sabbath to Sunday or
practiced it themselves.</p>

power received its deadly wound, and the prediction was fulfilled, 'He

  <p>I note that Stephen does not dispute that Sylvester I issued a
decree that the rest of the Sabbath would better be transferred to the
Lord’s day. That is, in effect, a concession that he did. Ellen White
stands completely vindicated.</p>
  <p>The revision of the cited passages happened in 1911, when new
printing plates for <i>Great Controversy</i> were produced. Ellen
White reviewed and approved all of a number of revisions in the new
edition, and the changes are all <a
 href="http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/GreatControversy1911.html">
documented</a> by Adventists today. </p>
  <p>While Catholics will claim the papacy was established with Peter,
even they will admit that it took centuries for the bishop of Rome to
develop a recognized and acknowledged ecclesiastical authority that
even approaches that exercised by today's pope (to say nothing of
temporal authority). Ellen White was not asserting that the bishop of
Rome suddenly appeared from nothing in 538 A.D., rather she was
referring to the decree of emperor <a href="jus-code.html">Justinian</a>
declaring the bishop of Rome to be the head of all churches, conferring
upon the papacy an official recognition by the state. This official
state sanction elevated the dignity of the bishop of Rome above his
peers in a way that can be rightly called a cornerstone in the imposing
edifice that the papacy became over the succeeding 1260 years known as
the dark or middle ages. This formal recognition by civil authority was
still considered to be an essential element as recently as 1929, when
the Lateran Pacts recognized the Roman Catholic Church as the official
state religion, in addition to granting the Vatican diplomatic status
as a state.</p>

to support church leaders in their promotion of Sunday worship. The
bishop of Rome could not have resorted to "the power of the state to

  <p>Doctor Bacchiocchi can be, and is, missing relevant facts:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp; It is a remarkable fact that
the first instance upon record in which the bishop of Rome attempted to
rule the Christian church was by AN EDICT IN BEHALF OF SUNDAY. It had
been the custom of all the churches to celebrate the passover, but with
this difference: that while the eastern churches observed it upon the
fourteenth day of the first month, no matter what day of the week this
might be, the western churches kept it upon the Sunday following that
day; or rather, upon the Sunday following Good Friday. Victor, bishop
of Rome, in the year 196,<sup>36</sup> took upon him to impose the
Roman custom upon all the churches; that is, to compel them to observe
the passover upon Sunday. "This bold attempt," says Bower, "we may call
the first essay of papal usurpation."<sup>37</sup> And Dowling terms it
the "earliest instance of Romish assumption."<sup>38<br>

  <p>So I suggest the statement that <em><font color="#993300">"It was
on behalf of Sunday that popery first asserted its arrogant claims;"</font></em><font
 color="#993300"> </font>is referring to Victor's edict imposing

 color="#993300"> <em>"and its first resort to the power of the state
was to compel the observance of Sunday as 'the Lord's Day" </em></font>refers,
in part, to the civil Sunday law of Constantine in 321. </p>
	<p>The second quote,
which I will extend, points this out:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<em><font color="#993300">Royal edicts, general councils, and
church ordinances sustained by secular power were the steps by which
the pagan festival [day of the Sun] attained its position of honor in
the Christian world. </font></em><span class="text" field="text">The
first public measure enforcing Sunday observance was the law enacted by
Constantine. [A. D. 321.] This edict required townspeople to rest on
"the venerable day of the sun," but permitted countrymen to continue
their agricultural pursuits. Though virtually a heathen statute, it was
enforced by the emperor after his nominal acceptance of Christianity."</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="text">Shorty thereafter, the council of Nicea, convened by 
  Constantine in 325, decreed Passover would be celebrated, not on the 14th of 
  Nisan according to the Biblical method, but rather, always on a Sunday to 
  honor the resurrection. Sunday became a little Easter every week. Emperor Theodosius II, a century later, issued
a Sunday law that specifically enforced "the Lord's day" as a Christian
day of rest and worship:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"On the following occasions all amusements of the theaters and
the circuses shall be denied throughout all cities to the people
thereof, and the minds of Christians and of the faithful shall be
wholly occupied in the worship of God: namely, on the Lord's day, which
is the first day of the whole week, on the Natal Day and Epiphany of
Christ, and on the day of Easter and of Pentecost, as long as the
vestments that imitate the light of the celestial font attest to the
new light of holy baptism; at the time also when the commemoration of
the Apostolic Passion, the teacher of all Christianity, is duly
celebrated by everyone." (Law of Theodosius II, Feb. 1, 425, in

  <p>A rather desperate attempt? Traditions seem more important than
admitting the facts? </p>
  <p>The fact is that a respected non-Adventist historian documented,
before the Adventist denomination was founded, that Sylvester I
decreed, in the fourth century, that the Sabbath rest should be
transferred to Sunday, and that Sunday should be called the Lord's day.
The fact is that Stephen Korsman, and others, said these statements
were in error:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I saw that the Sabbath commandment was not nailed to the cross.
If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to
break them all, as well as to break the fourth. I saw that God had not
changed the Sabbath, for He never changes. But the pope had changed it
from the seventh to the first day of the week; for he was to change
times and laws [Daniel 7:25]. -- Ellen White, <i>A word to the Little
Flock, </i>page 18, paragraph 3, and <i>Early Writings,</i> page 32,
