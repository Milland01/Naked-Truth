    <p>14. ... Unite, then, Venerable Brethren, your prayers with Ours, and at
    your exhortation let all Christian peoples add their prayers also, invoking
    the powerful and ever-acceptable intercession of the Blessed Virgin. You
    know well the intimate and wonderful relations existing between her and the
    Holy Ghost, so that she is justly called His Spouse. The intercession of the
    Blessed Virgin was of great avail both in the mystery of the Incarnation and
    in the coming of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles. ...</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Moreover, Mary's profound union with the Holy Spirit, the Sanctifier,
    leads to her role as Mediatrix of every grace bestowed to the human family.
    As <nobr>St. Maximilian Kolbe</nobr> taught, the Holy Spirit is so deeply
    united to Mary in the work of sanctification, that their inexpressible
    spousal union resembles (without fully reaching it) the union of the divine
    nature and human nature in the one person of Christ. And since the Holy
    Spirit always acts through the Virgin Mary in His sanctifying action, then
    all graces must come through Mary as Mediatrix of all graces.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Source: Quote from<em> Introduction to Mary</em>, by Mark Miravalle, S.T.D.,
  copyright 1993, bearing the Imprimatur and Nihil Obstat of the Catholic
  Church, published by Queenship Publishing Company, P.O. Box 42028, Santa
  Barbara, California, 93140-2028, page 167.
  <p>Please note that the above claims that Mary through her union with the Holy
  Spirit <em>has very nearly achieved the same status of deity / humanity as
  Jesus Christ!</em> And because of the presumed status of near-deity, Mary is
  allegedly qualified to dispense all grace in the role of Mediatrix! This is
  blasphemy! Who does not see the spirit of AntiChrist in this?
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="1">
  <p>In scripture, you will find that the <em>only</em> spouse mentioned for
  Mary was her husband, Joseph:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Mat 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother
    Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
    child of the Holy Ghost.
    <p>Luke 1:27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
    house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
    <p>Luke 2:5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
  </blockquote>
  The Bible is quite silent about Mary being the &quot;spouse&quot; of the Holy
  Spirit and you have to dig a little to find references to this teaching in
  Catholic sources. Even the new Vatican Catechism does not mention it. I
  suspect this idea originates in the delicate sensibilities and logic of the
  Catholic mind, which apparently assumes that for the Holy Spirit to conceive
  Jesus in Mary, the two should rightly be married! This same kind of human
  logic results in the dogmas of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, the
  Perpetual Virginity of Mary, the Assumption of Mary into Heaven, the Queenship
  of Mary and the doctrine of Mary the Mediatrix of all graces, all of which
  cannot be found in the Bible and are nothing more than the Traditions of men.
