<blockquote>
  <center><b><font size="7">Antichrist:<br>
  </font><font size="5">Denying Jesus Christ is Come in the Flesh</font></b></center>
  <hr>
  <p>There are only 4 verses in scripture that actually use the word Antichrist:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 2:18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard
    that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we
    know that it is the last time.<br>
    1 John 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had 
    been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, 
    that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.</p>
    <p>1 John 2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?
    He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.<br>
    1 John 2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father:</p>
    <p>1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether 
    they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<br>
    1 John 4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
    that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<br>
    1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in
    the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye
    have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>
    <p>2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
    that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
    antichrist.<br>
    2 John 1:8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have 
    wrought, but that we receive a full reward.<br>
    2 John 1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of 
    Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath 
    both the Father and the Son.<br>
    2 John 1:10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive 
    him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:<br>
    2 John 1:11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I would like to focus initially on the last two passages, that give a
  special identifiable characteristic of Antichrist. Clearly, the spirit of
  Antichrist denies the incarnation of&nbsp; Jesus Christ in the flesh. This
  seems initially to be fairly straightforward, but actually involves a subtlety
  that requires study and understanding to perceive the deception spoken of in 2
  John 1:7. So, just what does &quot;flesh&quot; mean in those verses?</p>
  <p align="center"><u><font size="5">Defining The &quot;Flesh&quot;</font></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 5:19 Now the <b>works of the flesh</b> are manifest, which are these;
    Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br>
    Gal 5:20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
    seditions, heresies,<br>
    Gal 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the
    which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they
    which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p>Rom 8:3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
    flesh, God sending his own Son <b>in the likeness of sinful flesh</b>, and
    for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:<br>
    Rom 8:4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk
    not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.<br>
    Rom 8:5 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
    but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.<br>
    Rom 8:6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
    life and peace.<br>
    Rom 8:7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject
    to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<br>
    Rom 8:8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.<br>
    Rom 8:9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
    Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he
    is none of his.<br>
    Rom 8:10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the
    Spirit is life because of righteousness.<br>
    Rom 8:11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
    in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
    mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.<br>
    Rom 8:12 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live
    after the flesh.<br>
    Rom 8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the
    Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.<br>
    Rom 8:14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
    God.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual,
    but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.<br>
    1 Cor 3:2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were
    not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.<br>
    1 Cor 3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and
    strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly, &quot;flesh&quot; can be interpreted as synonymous with being a
  sinner, or &quot;carnal&quot;, which is defined as lacking the Holy Spirit.
  Adam and Eve when they were created were in perfect harmony with God, and had
  a spiritual nature. When they sinned, they lost this spiritual nature, and
  became carnal sinners. Ever since the fall, the children of Adam and Eve and
  their descendents are born carnal, lacking the spiritual nature forfeited in
  the garden. So when John says that Christ is &quot;come in the flesh&quot;, he
  is actually saying that Christ was born by a sinner that had a carnal nature.</p>
  <p>Note what the following says about being carnal:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold
    under sin.<br>
    Rom 7:15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not;
    but what I hate, that do I.<br>
    Rom 7:16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it
    is good.<br>
    Rom 7:17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.<br>
    Rom 7:18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good
    thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good
    I find not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To be carnal is to be <i>sold under sin</i>. So Jesus Christ had to born of
  a <i>sinner</i> to &quot;come in the flesh&quot;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
    David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto
    this day.<br>
    Acts 2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an
    oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, <b>according to the flesh</b>,
    he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p>
    <p>Rom 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of <b>the
    seed of David according to the flesh;</b><br>
    Rom 1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
    spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
    <p>Heb 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
    the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace
    of God should taste death for every man. ...<br>
    Heb 2:14 Forasmuch then <b>as the children are partakers of flesh and blood,
    he also himself likewise took part of the same</b>; that through death he
    might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;<br>
    Heb 2:15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
    subject to bondage.<br>
    Heb 2:16 For verily <b>he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took
    on him the seed of Abraham.</b><br>
    Heb 2:17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his
    brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things
    pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.<br>
    Heb 2:18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
    succour them that are tempted.<br>
    Heb 3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
    consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><u>All Have Sinned - Except Jesus Christ The
  Son Of God</u></font></p>
  <p>So Christ was born of a sinner, Mary, a descendant of Adam and Eve, and
  Abraham, and David, who herself needed redemption from sin, and this is
  something that she herself clearly recognized:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 1:46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,<br>
    Luke 1:47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Mary is no exception. As a sinner, she like the rest of us also needed a
  Saviour.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Ki 8:46 If they sin against thee, (<b>for there is no man that sinneth
    not,</b>) ...</p>
    <p>2 Chr 6:36 If they sin against thee, (<b>for there is no man which
    sinneth not,</b>) ...</p>
    <p>Psa 51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and <b>in sin did my mother
    conceive me.</b></p>
    <p>Eccl 7:20 <b>For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
    sinneth not.</b></p>
    <p>Rom 3:10 As it is written, <b>There is none righteous, no, not one:</b><br>
    Rom 3:11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
    God.<br>
    Rom 3:12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become
    unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
    <p>Rom 3:23 For <b>all have sinned</b>, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
    <p>Rom 5:12 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
    by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that <b>all have sinned</b>:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Christ could only inherit the fallen nature of the children of Adam and
  Eve from his mother, because <b>she was a sinner</b>,</i> yet scripture tells
  us that Christ was NOT a sinner, and never sinned:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
    into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<br>
    Heb 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
    feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, <b>yet
    without sin</b>.<br>
    Heb 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
    obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.<br>
    <br>
    2 Cor 5:20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
    you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.<br>
    2 Cor 5:21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, <b>who knew no sin</b>;
    that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><u>The Last Adam (Jesus Christ) Was Made
  Spiritual</u></font></p>
  <p>Born of a sinner with a carnal nature, Jesus Christ knew no sin. How is
  that possible? How was His birth different from the rest of us?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:6 <font color="#FF0000">That which is born of the flesh is flesh;
    and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</font><br>
    John 3:7 <font color="#FF0000">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be
    born again.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>While Christ was indeed born of a sinner that lacked a spiritual nature, <i>He
  was also born of the Holy Spirit:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
    mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found
    with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p>Luke 1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall
    come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:
    therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called
    the Son of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Though born of the flesh (of a sinner), scripture tells us that Jesus Christ had, <i>before</i> 
  the incarnation, and from His conception, the spiritual nature that Adam and 
  Eve had lost!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: <b>God
    was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit,</b> seen of angels,
    preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into
    glory.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
    soul; <b>the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</b><br>
    1 Cor 15:46 Howbeit that was not first [Adam] which is spiritual, but that
    which is natural; and <b>afterward that [last Adam] which is spiritual.</b><br>
    1 Cor 15:47 The first man [Adam] is of the earth, earthy: <b>the second man
    [Jesus Christ] is the Lord from heaven</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So a prominent characteristic of Antichrist is a denial that Jesus Christ
  &quot;came in the flesh&quot;, which is to say a denial that He was born of a
  sinner (Mary), who herself could only pass on a carnal human nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><u><font size="5">Roman Catholicism Dogmatically Decrees That
Mary Was Sinless</font></u></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note the following papal decree:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the
    most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a
    singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits
    of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race, was preserved free from all
    stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be
    believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.<br>
    <br>
    Hence, if anyone shall dare -- which God forbid! -- to think otherwise than
    as has been defined by us, let him know and understand that he is condemned
    by his own judgment; that he has suffered shipwreck in the faith; that he
    has separated from the unity of the Church; and that, furthermore, by his
    own action he incurs the penalties established by law if he should dare to
    express in words or writing or by any other outward means the errors he
    think in his heart. ...</p>
    <p>Let all the children of the Catholic Church, who are so very dear to us,
    hear these words of ours. With a still more ardent zeal for piety, religion
    and love, let them continue to venerate, invoke and pray to the most Blessed
    Virgin Mary, Mother of God, conceived without original sin. Let them fly
    with utter confidence to this most sweet Mother of mercy and grace in all
    dangers, difficulties, needs, doubts and fears. Under her guidance, under
    her patronage, under her kindness and protection, nothing is to be feared;
    nothing is hopeless. ...<br>

    Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius IX on the Immaculate Conception
    (December 8, 1854)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The decree of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, that Mary was sinless from
  <i>her</i> conception in <i>her mother's</i> womb, is considered to be an <i>ex
  cathedra</i> teaching, from Peter's Chair, an infallible article of faith 
  binding on all Roman Catholics. Shortly after the dogmatic declaration of Pius 
  IX, an alleged apparition repeatedly appeared to <font size="3">a young girl, 
  Bernadette Soubirous, at Lourdes, France. The apparition identified herself as 
  the &quot;Immaculate Conception.&quot;&nbsp; John warns us to try the spirits:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 John 4:1 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether 
  they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.<br>
  1 John 4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that 
  Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<br>
  1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in 
  the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye 
  have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The apparition at Lourdes fails the test, by claiming to be<font size="3"> 
  the &quot;Immaculate Conception.&quot;</font> Catholics are also taught that Mary never 
  sinned her entire life:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>411</b> ... Mary benefited first of all and uniquely from Christ's
    victory over sin: she was preserved from all stain of original sin and by a
    special grace of God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly
    life.<sup>306</sup></p>

  <p>Catholics also teach that Jesus Christ inherited His sinless immaculate
  nature from His mother Mary:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... I admit we [Catholics] speak glowingly of Mary (who doesn't love and speak well 
    of their mother?), but in this context I was being the prosaic, theological 
    one. I wasn't using poetic, superlative language about the Blessed Virgin. I 
    was simply laying out the logic: Jesus was the sinless Son of God. 
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">He took 
    his sinless human nature from his mother. For that human nature to be really 
    human and really sinless its human source must have been uniquely pure.</span> This 
    seems to be a simple, logical, and modest claim.</p>

  <p>Mary has been elevated in Roman Catholic teaching to a Mediatrix of
  Salvation, interposing her between Christ and mankind, when scripture tells us
  there is but <i>one</i> mediator:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and <b>one mediator</b> between God and
    men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
    <p>Heb 8:6 But now hath he [Jesus] obtained a more excellent ministry, by
    how much also <b>he is the mediator</b> of a better covenant, which was
    established upon better promises.</p>
    <p>Heb 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
    Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead
    works to serve the living God?<br>
    Heb 9:15 And for this cause <b>he is the mediator</b> of the new testament,
    that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were
    under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise
    of eternal inheritance.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that the Pope, titled
  Vicarius Christi (which is synonymous with the word Antichrist), takes the
  place of Jesus Christ on Earth:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... We [the pope] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty, ...</p>

    Publicae</i></b></a> (The Reunion of Christendom), dated June 20, 1894,
    trans. in The Great Encyclical Letters of Pope Leo XIII (New York: Benziger,
    1903), paragraph 5, page 304.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <span class="author">
  <p>Another authentic papal title is Vicarius Filii Dei (Vicar of the Son of 
  God), which equals 666 (Rev. 13:18) when the Roman numeral value of the 
  letters are added up. It has a long documented history of use by the Roman Catholic 
  Church, and was used most recently by Pope Paul VI in two Apostolic Constitutions, 
  which are the highest form of official Papal decree in the Roman Catholic 
  Church. For the details see: <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><b> <a href="666.html">666, The Number of the Beast</a></b><a href="666.html">.</a></p>
  </span>
  <p>Ask a Catholic a question about the Holy Father, and they will likely think
  you are talking about the Pope, yet this title is used only one time in all of
  scripture (John 17:11), and it refers not to any man, but to God the Father.
  The application of this title to anyone but God is a blasphemous antichrist
  usurpation.</p>
  <p>It is also a papal teaching that not just the Pope, but <i>every</i>
  Catholic priest is, in fact, <i>another Christ</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>12. ... Thus the priest, as is said with good reason, is indeed
    &quot;another Christ&quot;; for, in some way, he is himself a continuation
    of Christ. ...</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><u><font size="6">Conclusion</font></u></b></p>
  <p>By denying Mary was a sinner in need of a redeemer, Roman Catholicism
  denies Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, and this is the deceptive teaching
  and spirit of antichrist that John spoke of:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 4:2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
    that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:<br>
    1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in
    the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye
    have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.</p>
    <p>2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
    that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an
    antichrist.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And by teaching that the Catholic priest is &quot;another Christ&quot; and
  that Mary is a Mediatrix, Advocate, and Co-redemptrix, placing her between God
  and mankind and dispenser of all grace, the Roman Catholic Church fits this
  characteristic identified by John:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 2:22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?
    He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.<br>
    1 John 2:23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father:</p>
