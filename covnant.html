<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 59:21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the
LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from
henceforth and for ever.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This verse has been quoted to me in the past in an effort to
support Catholic Tradition. At first glance it seems to be speaking
about an oral covenant. It talks only about words put in the mouth, but
nothing about that covenant being written down. And this covenant
clearly IS passed down from generation to generation orally. Is this
finally proof of the concept of Catholic Tradition? Tradition, meaning
that it is NOT dependent on the written scriptures for authenticity?</p>
  <p>First, what is a covenant? It is a promise or contract between two
parties, which could be either written or oral, or both. Looking at the
verse in question, it is clearly speaking of a covenant made between
the Lord God and His people. Just what covenant though, is not clear
when you look at just this verse, so let's expand our horizons just a
little (something the person quoting verse 21 to me apparently did not
do) -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 59:20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them
that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.<br>
Isa 59:21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth,
shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed,
nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the LORD, from
henceforth and for ever.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Looking now at verse 20, is there a covenant to be found there?
Only the most important covenant to all of humanity! A Redeemer will
come to Zion! The promise or covenant of Genesis 3:15 restated again.
Obviously this covenant can be found throughout scripture, <em>repeatedly</em>.
Indeed, this covenant will <em>also</em> be on the lips of God's
people from generation to generation for all of time since it is the
very core of the gospel message.</p>
  <p>This is a prime example of how tenuous it is to look for single
verse proof texts without making an effort to understand a verse in
context. What looks so good at cursory reading turns out to be quite
embarrassing to one's case under even the slightest investigation. I
can't think of a better example to encourage everyone to read the Bible
with an eye to understanding it for yourself. Read every verse in
context, and then read other passages that are related to the same
subject. This is the only way to really understand what the Bible is
trying to say.</p>
