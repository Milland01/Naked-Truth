<title>Did Jesus Declare All Foods Clean?</title>
</head>

<body>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">Did Jesus Declare All Foods Clean?</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Let's compare two translations of scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 7:18 (NIV) <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Are you so dull?&quot;</font> he asked.
    <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the 
    outside can make him 'unclean'?</font><br>
    Mark 7:19 (NIV) <font color="#FF0000">For it doesn't go into his heart but 
    into his stomach, and then out of his body.&quot;</font> (In saying this, Jesus 
    declared all foods &quot;clean.&quot;)</p>
    <p>Mark 7:18 (KJV) And he saith unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Are ye so 
    without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from 
    without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</font><br>
    Mark 7:19 (KJV) <font color="#FF0000">Because it entereth not into his 
    heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all 
    meats?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Those two translations do not say the same thing. The King James does not 
    have Jesus declaring all foods clean, in the biblical sense. It is saying 
    all food passes through the body and is expelled. Jesus is not removing the 
    prohibition on eating unclean animals. Modern translations like the NIV that 
    say Jesus declared all foods clean are in error, and are intentionally 
    mistranslated in order to justify eating the biblically unclean animals. 
    Note the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 1:8&nbsp; (KJV) But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not 
    defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which 
    he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might 
    not defile himself.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This begs the question, was Daniel sadly mistaken in believing he would be 
  defiled by the King's unclean food and drink? </p>
  <p>If one takes the position that Jesus said no food was unclean, that 
  everything could be eaten without discrimination, then why did Daniel believe 
  otherwise? There seems to be a problem of contradiction between these two 
  passages. </p>
  <p>Noah was aware of a distinction God had made between clean and unclean 
  animals, even before the flood (Gen. 7:2), long before the time of the Mosaic 
  food laws of Leviticus chapter 11, which specifies animals that are unclean, 
  an abomination, and are not to be eaten. The Hebrew word translated as 
  unclean, from Strong's concordance:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>H2931. tame', taw-may'; from H2930; foul in a relig. sense:--defiled, + 
    infamous, polluted (-tion), unclean.</p>
    <p>H2930. tame', taw-may'; a prim. root; to be foul, espec. in a cerem. or 
    mor. sense (contaminated):--defile (self), pollute (self), be (make, make 
    self, pronounce) unclean, X utterly.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that &quot;unclean&quot; animals are polluted, contaminated and foul. That the 
  unclean animals were taken into the ark by twos, and the clean animals by 
  sevens, shows that Noah ate no unclean animals after the flood, nor used them 
  for sacrifices (Gen 8:20), because that would have meant automatic extinction 
  for the unclean animals. When after the flood, Noah was given permission to 
  eat animals (Gen 9:3), it was in this context of the clean and unclean, which 
  Noah was already aware of, it did not permit him to eat the unclean animals.</p>
  <p>Because the differences in clean and unclean animals were made known to 
  Noah before the flood, before permission to eat animals was given to humanity, 
  it was something known and obeyed even by Abraham:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 26:5&nbsp; Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, 
    my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Daniel, in Daniel chapter 1, was on very firm ground in his insistence 
  that the King's unclean food would defile him, because from the time of Noah, 
  to Abraham, and through the time of Moses, God had instructed his people to 
  know the difference in clean and unclean food, and to observe the prohibitions 
  against the unclean. Note that Daniel's obedience, with respect to not eating 
  the unclean foods of the king, was handsomely rewarded with good health:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 1:15&nbsp; And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared 
    fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion 
    of the king's meat.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In addition to the prohibitions in Leviticus 11, Daniel also had this 
  earlier example in Exodus to guide him in keeping his health through his diet:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 15:26&nbsp; And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of 
    the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt 
    give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of 
    these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am 
    the LORD that healeth thee.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>While not explicitly stated there, I think it is reasonable to assume that 
  the diseases spoken of would have been the result of not heeding the 
  distinctions made by God in clean and unclean animals. In addition there was a 
  spiritual benefit for Daniel in refraining from eating the King's unclean 
  food:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 1:16&nbsp; Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the 
    wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.<br>
    Dan 1:17&nbsp; As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill 
    in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and 
    dreams.</p>
    <p>Dan 1:20&nbsp; And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king 
    inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and 
    astrologers that were in all his realm.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Because Daniel would <u>not</u> eat the unclean food, or drink alcoholic 
  wine, he was blessed with 
  spiritual knowledge and wisdom. Now I ask, would Daniel still have been 
  blessed by God if he had eaten the king's unclean food or drank his wine? I think not, and I see 
  no reason that this principle would not apply to us even today. So now back to 
  Jesus in the New Testament. </p>
  <p>
  <b>Question:</b> In Mark chapter 7, did Jesus declare all animals clean, 
  thereby declaring a change in the status of previously unclean animals, 
  removing the prohibition against eating them?<b> <br>
  My answer:</b> The unclean animals were, and still are, unclean in the same 
  manner that Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Daniel understood them to be from God. 
  Nothing Jesus said <u>changed</u> the status of unclean animals. He did not 
  repeal the laws prohibiting the eating of unclean animals, and unclean animals 
  are never given the status of being fit for food.</p>
  <p>
  <b>Question:</b> Were previously unclean animals now fit for sacrifices in the 
  temple as a result of Jesus' declaration? <br>
  <b>My Answer:</b> No, they never were fit for sacrifice, and nothing Jesus 
  said changed that.</p>
  <p>
  <b>Question:</b> If one maintains that Jesus changed the status of previously 
  unclean animals, and removed God's restrictions against eating them, then I 
  ask you, did a change also physically occur in the animals themselves, such 
  that they were now fit for consumption, when previously they were an 
  abomination?<b><br>
  My answer:</b> The unclean animals did not change in any respect as a result 
  of Jesus' teaching. They were a health hazard in the Old Testament, polluted 
  and intrinsically unfit for human consumption, and they remain so today.</p>
  <p><b>Question: </b>Then what <i>exactly</i> did Jesus say? What <i>was</i> He 
  teaching? Look at the parallel passage in Matthew:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <u><b>The scribes and Pharisees condemn Jesus' disciples for not washing 
    their hands</b></u></div>
  <div align="left">
    <blockquote>
      <p>Mat 15:1&nbsp; Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of 
      Jerusalem, saying,<br>
      Mat 15:2&nbsp; Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the 
      elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.<br>
      Mat 15:3&nbsp; But he answered and said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">
      Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <font color="#000000"></font>
    <div align="center">

      thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die 
      the death.</font><br>
      Mat 15:5&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to

      profited by me;</font><br>
      Mat 15:6&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">And honour not his father or his 
      mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none 
      effect by your tradition.</font><br>
      Mat 15:7&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias 
      prophesy of you, saying,</font><br>

      their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from

      man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p><b>Question: </b>Did Jesus conclude that the biblically unclean foods were 
  now clean?<br>
  <b>My Answer: </b>No, He concluded that a man is not defiled by unwashed 
  hands. Repeal of the biblically unclean foods prohibitions was simply not 
  under discussion in the context of the passage. If that were what the scribes 
  and Pharisees had understood Him to say, they would have gone berserk in their 
  condemnation of Jesus, and would have charged him with heresy in abandoning or 
  contradicting the dietary restrictions of God, but this they never did, <i>
  because Jesus never did say or imply any such thing</i>.</p>
  <p><b>Question: </b>So according to Jesus, does food defile a man?<br>
  <b>My Answer: </b>No, it does not, not in the sense Jesus was speaking about.</p>
  <p>
  <b>Question: </b>In the context of Jesus' teaching, what was meant by &quot;defileth&quot; 
  in verse 11?<br>
  <b>My Answer:</b> The scribes and Pharisees were condemning the disciples for
  <u>not washing their hands</u>, implying that they were therefore defiled or 
  unclean, because Jesus' disciples did not follow the traditions of the elders. 
  Jesus replied by rebuking the scribes and Pharisees, saying that nothing a man 
  puts into his mouth defiles the heart, defilement which He defined as
  <font color="#FF0000">&quot;evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, 
  thefts, false witness, </font>[and]<font color="#FF0000"> blasphemies&quot;</font>.
  <font color="#000000">The scribes and Pharisees, and Jesus, were speaking on
  <u>two entirely different levels</u>, the scribes and Pharisees were concerned 
  with the cleanliness of the hands, and Jesus the cleanliness of the heart. 
  Jesus was saying that nothing a man eats results in an unclean (sinful) heart, 
  rather what a man says and does reveals the state of his heart. In other 
  words, there is no direct cause and effect between any food and </font>
  <font color="#ff0000">&quot;evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, 
  thefts, false witness, </font>[and]<font color="#ff0000"> blasphemies&quot;<font color="#000000">, 
  so neither does unwashed hands produce these things either. Yet Jesus was <u>
  not</u> saying that the biblically unclean foods were now changed, and now 
  healthy to eat, nor was He removing the biblical prohibitions against eating 
  them. They were and still are </font></font>polluted, contaminated and foul<font color="#000000">, 
  hazards to your health.</font></p>
  <p><b>Question: </b>So why is Mark 7:19 worded the way it is in the NIV 
  and some other Bibles? (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods &quot;clean.&quot;)<br>
  <b>My Answer: </b>We need to look also at the King James, which reads 
  differently:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 7:18&nbsp; (KJV) And he saith unto them, <font color="#ff0000">Are 
    ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing 
    from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</font><br>
    Mark 7:19 (KJV) <font color="#ff0000">Because it entereth not into his 
    heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, <u>purging</u> 
    all meats?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From what I have read, it is clear in the Greek (I don't know Greek) that 
  the words &quot;purging all meats&quot; were not said by Jesus, but by the author of 
  Mark as a comment, and that is why some Bibles that say &quot;In saying this, Jesus 
  declared all foods clean&quot; have it in black and not red. They take the &quot;And he saith unto them&quot; from verse 18 and combine it with &quot;purging all meats&quot; from 
  the end of verse 19, and this results in the statement in question in Mark 
  7:19 of the NIV and other bibles. </p>
  <p>Note the word &quot;purging&quot; in verse 19. The word translated as purging has 
  more than one meaning, and the differences are important. Jesus is teaching 
  that it is significant that food passes through the body and ends up in the 
  toilet. This observation would not be important if all food was intrinsically 
  &quot;clean&quot; in the biblical sense before being eaten, since it would be clean 
  going in, so to speak. Jesus is making the point that all food (clean or 
  unclean) passes through the body, including that defiled by unwashed hands, and 
  that it is not retained such that it corrupts a man's heart, causing him to 
  sin. The food a man eats does not in itself cause a man to commit sin. All 
  food is quickly expelled from the body, and this is what the comment at the 
  end of verse 19 is observing, not that Jesus removed the prohibitions against 
  biblically unclean foods.</p>
  <p>In context, I suggest that this is the correct way to understand that 
  passage:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 7:18&nbsp; And he saith unto them, <font color="#ff0000">Are ye so 
    without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from 
    without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</font><br>
    Mark 7:19&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">Because it entereth not into his 
    heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the toilet,
    <font color="#000000"><u><b>(expelling</b></u> all foods [from the body.])?</font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the error in some Bibles in Mark 7:19, I propose, is that of intentional 
  misinterpretation of the following word:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>G2511. katharizo, kath-ar-id'-zo; from G2513; to cleanse (lit. or 
    fig.):--(make) clean (-se), purge, purify.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If it is interpreted as &quot;cleansing&quot; <u>the food</u>, it results in all 
  foods being cleansed in the process of consumption. If it is interpreted as 
  &quot;purging&quot;, in the sense of all foods being <u>expelled</u> from the body, it 
  means something quite different. I suggest that the latter is the correct 
  interpretation. Here is <a href="http://www.m-w.com/home.htm">Merriam 
  Webster's dictionary</a> definition of &quot;purge&quot;, which supports this 
  conclusion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Inflected Form(s): <b>purged</b>; <b>purg·ing</b><br>
    Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French <i>purgier, </i>from Latin <i>
    purigare, purgare </i>to purify, purge, from <i>purus </i>pure + <i>-igare
    </i>(akin to <i>agere </i>to drive, do) -- more at <font size="-1">ACT</font><br>
    Date: 14th century<br>
    <i>transitive senses</i><br>
    <b>1 a</b> <b>:</b> to clear of guilt <b>b</b> <b>:</b> to free from moral 
    or ceremonial defilement<br>
    <b>2 a</b> <b>:</b> to cause evacuation from (as the bowels) <b>b </b>(1) <b>
    :</b> to make free of something unwanted &lt;<i>purge</i> a manhole of gas&gt; &lt;<i>purge</i> 
    yourself of fear&gt; (2) <b>:</b> to free (as a boiler) of sediment or relieve 
    (as a steam pipe) of trapped air by bleeding <b>c </b>(1) <b>:</b> to rid 
    (as a nation or party) by a purge (2) <b>:</b> to get rid of &lt;the leaders 
    had been <i>purged</i>&gt; &lt;<i>purge</i> money-losing operations&gt;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is the second definition that I suggest applies in Mark 7:19, and was 
  the reason the King James uses it instead of &quot;cleansing all meats&quot;. So with 
  that interpretation of purging, Jesus was indeed teaching that no food you eat 
  can corrupt your heart, such that it can be blamed for causing you to sin, but He did <i>not</i> remove the prohibitions 
  against eating unclean animals, they remain an abomination, unfit for human 
  consumption, and and a hazard to your health to this day. And as with Daniel, 
  obeying God's prohibition against eating the unclean has not only physical, 
  but spiritual rewards as well.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of 
    God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because 
    they are spiritually discerned.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p><b>Does Prayer Sanctify Unclean Animals?</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 4:1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times 
    some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and 
    doctrines of devils;<br>
    1 Tim 4:2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a 
    hot iron;<br>
    1 Tim 4:3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which 
    God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and 
    know the truth.<br>
    1 Tim 4:4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if 
    it be received with thanksgiving:<br>
    1 Tim 4:5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Some will cite verses 4 and 5 as proof that anything you might eat is 
    sanctified by prayer. However the context is found in verse 3: &quot;... meats, 
    which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving ... .&quot; Unclean 
    animals were not created to be eaten by man, there is no way that God can 
    ever sanctify something He explicitly condemns as an abomination (Lev. 11).</p>
