<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp; T</font>he back cover of <i>The 
  Ten Offenses</i> by Pat Robertson asserts:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">&nbsp;&nbsp; C</font>ourts run amok, fueled 
    by secular allies, are eroding America's spiritual foundations. As a 
    consequence, the historic blessings and benefits of the Ten Commandments are 
    being spun as a great offense to our religiously diverse culture. Nothing 
    could be further from the truth. &quot;Religious pluralism thrives in America as 
    a result of our Christian heritage, not in spite of it,&quot; says Pat Robertson. 
    He calls on all Americans to reclaim their spiritual roots<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;to 
    reaffirm the central role of God's fundamental laws&#8213;before its too late.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat Robertson, right from the title of chapter 7, 
  is himself promoting a subtle but profound act of rebellion against God's 
  Sabbath Commandment. It was an act of apostasy and rebellion prophesied in the 
  Old Testament book of Daniel, and it will have immense consequences in the 
  near future. It is the intent of this critique to repair this breach, and tell 
  you the biblical truth, to be the restorer of the paths to dwell in. </p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the introduction to his chapter on the 
  Sabbath Commandment, Pat says </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot; ... God delivered the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount 
    Sinai, reminding the Israelites that they had been slaves in Egypt. Now one 
    of the blessings of freedom was a day each week for rest, ... a chance to 
    meditate on the fact that their Creator brought forth the glory of creation 
    in six days, and then on the seventh day rested.&quot; ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small but significant omission should be 
  noted in the chapter's introduction. Israel did not first learn of the seventh 
  day Sabbath rest at Sinai. This was presented to them <u>before</u> they ever 
  arrived at Sinai, in chapter 16 of Exodus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 16:23 And he [Moses] said unto them, This is that which 
    the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: 
    ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Days before Moses and Israel arrived at 
  Sinai, manna from heaven began falling six days of the week, but on the 
  seventh day, a particular day <i>specified</i> by God, no manna was to be 
  found. Israel was to collect a double portion on the sixth day, and rest, 
  collecting nothing, on the seventh day. Almost immediately however, some 
  ignored God's command, and violated it by going out to search for manna on the 
  Sabbath day, bringing a sharp rebuke on Moses and Israel:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of 
    the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.<br>
    Exo 16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my 
    commandments and my laws?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violating God's Sabbath Commandment is a 
  very serious matter, something that even Pat Robertson acknowledges at the 
  close of the chapter's introduction (pg. 102):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&quot;We violate God's Fourth Commandment at our peril.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not agree more with that last 
  sentence. It is that nugget of truth that must be kept in mind as we dissect 
  and correct what Pat Roberson maintains in the rest of the chapter. There are 
  10 subsections to examine:</p>
  <p align="left"><u><b>A Correct View of the Sabbath</b></u></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Pat relates how the religious leaders 
  of Israel had corrupted the Sabbath observance with their rules of Tradition, 
  making the Sabbath an intolerable burden on the people, even to the point of 
  criticizing Jesus and his disciples for violating the Sabbath rest by picking 
  grain when passing through a field. Pat warns:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&quot;... we should carefully avoid being legalistic about the 
    Sabbath, lest we become like the oppressive religious leaders of Jesus's 
    day.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat then relates how his very busy father, 
  a U.S. Senator, always maintained a sense of perspective about the need for 
  periodic rest, that he &quot;practiced a correct understanding of the Sabbath 
  rest&quot;. While he may have thought he did, he probably did not keep a Sabbath 
  day his entire life, for reasons that will become clear.</p>
  <p align="left"><u><b>The Blessing of a Sabbath Rest</b></u></p>
  <p align="left">Isaiah 58:13-14 is quoted, and Pat says he has adopted it as 
  his own standard. It reads in the King James:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Isa 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, <i>
    from</i> doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, 
    the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own 
    ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <i>thine own</i> words:<br>
    Isa 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee 
    to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage 
    of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a wonderful promise from God, a 
  promise of blessings, but blessings conditional upon obedience. Note that the 
  Lord calls the Sabbath &quot;my holy day&quot;. Remember the rebuke of the Lord to Moses 
  when some of the people went out to collect manna on the Sabbath? That day 
  was, and is, the seventh day of the week, Saturday.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>Taking a Day for Sabbath Rest</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, amazingly enough, Pat acknowledges 
  that the Bible Sabbath is, in fact, Saturday, observed from sundown to 
  sundown. So the truth is that it was on Saturday, a day specified by God, that 
  Israel was forbidden by God to search for manna. It was on the seventh day, 
  Saturday, that some of Israel rebelled by not resting as instructed (Exo. 
  16:27-28). It is Saturday that Isaiah 58:13-14 speaks to, and the Lord 
  promises a blessing to those who do His will on that day. In spite of what Pat 
  Robertson knows to be true, that Saturday is God's specified Sabbath day, he 
  writes the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;Sunday in biblical times was called &quot;the first day of the 
    week&quot; (Acts 20:7; 1 Corinthians 16:2). Since this was the day of the 
    resurrection of Jesus Christ, the early Christians<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;most 
    of whom were Jewish&#8213;held their meetings on Sunday rather than Saturday. As 
    custom developed, the Christian Sabbath, or day of rest and worship, became 
    Sunday, and this was the day established by law in America.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There you have 
  it, the prophesied breach that calls out for repair. There is absolutely no 
  biblical proof, not one verse, that the Apostles ever abandoned the Sabbath to 
  keep Sunday. See </font><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><font face="Times New Roman">
  <b><a href="firstday.html">Did the Apostles Keep Sunday?</a></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that 
  in the previous section, Pat told us he had adopted </font>Isaiah 58:13-14 as 
  his standard. Well, Isaiah 58:13-14, talks of keeping the seventh day Saturday 
  Sabbath. It has no application what-so-ever to the first day of the week, 
  Sunday. It is <u>impossible</u> to keep God's designated Sabbath day on 
  Sunday. Where was this breach of God's law prophesied?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Dan 7:25 And he [the little horn] shall speak great words 
    against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and 
    think to change times and laws [of the most High]: ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is only one of the Ten Commandments 
  of the most High God that deals with time, and that is the Saturday Sabbath 
  Commandment (Exo 20:8-11), which Daniel says the little horn power would <i>
  think</i> to change. Since the Reformation, Protestants have long held that 
  the little horn of Daniel 7 is the papacy, the Roman Catholic Church, and 
  Catholics boldly admit they are responsible for the change of God's law:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; The Church, on the other hand, after changing the day of rest from 
    the Jewish Sabbath, or seventh day of the week, to the first, made the Third 
    Commandment refer to Sunday as the day to be kept holy as the Lord's Day. 
    The Council of Trent (Sess. VI, can. xix) condemns those who deny that the 
    Ten Commandments are binding on Christians.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><b><u>Commerce on the Lord's Day</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section begins with the statement:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;In America, keeping the Sabbath as 'the Lord's day' has 
    largely become an antiquated idea.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Sabbath is <u>Saturday,</u> and Pat
  <u>knows this</u>. To be exact, his statement is wrong, it is worded 
  backwards. What Pat means to say is<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;</font>In 
  America, keeping 'the Lord's day' [Sunday] as the Sabbath has largely become 
  an antiquated idea<font face="Times New Roman">. He is lamenting the fact that 
  people have lost their sense of Sunday as a day of rest. He goes on to relate 
  the gradual erosion of Blue Laws, intended to protect the Sunday rest, to the 
  point that now Sunday is probably the busiest day of the week for most 
  retailers. It is interesting to point out that Sunday keepers have 
  historically sought the policeman and civil government to enforce Sunday Blue 
  Laws on the whole community, while at the same time branding the 7th day 
  Sabbath keeper a <i>legalist, </i>and an<i> enemy of grace, </i>for merely <i>
  teaching</i> that according to the Holy Bible, the Sabbath commandment has <u>
  no application to Sunday</u>, and should still be kept on Saturday as God has 
  commanded.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>A Day that Belongs to God</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat now asserts: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;According to the God of the Bible, Sunday belongs to Him. 
    ... Christians have worshipped on this day throughout time, the point is 
    that for centuries Sunday has been the one day that belongs <i>to the Lord.</i>&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one Bible verse is offered as proof 
  that Sunday is decreed by God to be a Sabbath, or that it is declared by God 
  to be the Lord's day, because <i>there is no such verse</i>. That Christians 
  have observed the day for nearly 2000 years is undisputed, it is indeed a 
  Tradition of the church, but it lacks any Bible support, it has no &quot;thus saith 
  the Lord&quot;. Pat's statement above is false<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;t</font>hough 
  he earnestly and sincerely believes it, it is a lie.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>The Blessings of the Lord's Day</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The word Sabbath is used in this section 
  (not the Lord's Day) to promote the physical and spiritual benefits of keeping 
  Sunday as a day of rest. Don't change a word, read Sabbath properly as meaning 
  Saturday, and this section seems to need no correction.</p>
  <p align="left"><u><b>A Reminder of God's Rest</b></u></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides wrongly using the term Sabbath to 
  mean Sunday, Pat quotes Revelation 1:10 where John says he was in the spirit 
  on &quot;the Lord's day.&quot; This is the only instance in the entire Bible where this 
  phrase is used. Note the following from a Catholic writer about Rev. 1:10-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">The ninth text wherein we meet the expression &quot;the Lord's 
    day,&quot; is the last to be found in the apostolic writings. The Apocalypse, or 
    Revelation, first chapter, tenth verse, furnishes it in the following words 
    of John: &quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day;&quot; but it will afford no more 
    comfort to our Biblical friends than its predecessors of the same series. 
    Has St. John used the expression previously in his Gospel or Epistles? — 
    Emphatically, NO. Has he had occasion to refer to Sunday hitherto? —Yes, 
    twice. How did he designate Sunday on these occasions? Easter Sunday was 
    called by him (John 20:1) <em>&quot;the first day of the week.&quot; </em>Again, 
    chapter twenty, nineteenth verse: &quot;Now when it was late that same day, <em>
    being the first day of the week.&quot;</em> Evidently, although inspired, both in 
    his Gospel and Epistles, he called Sunday &quot;the first day of the week.&quot; On 
    what grounds, then, can it be assumed that he dropped that designation? Was 
    he <em>more inspired</em> when he wrote the Apocalypse, or did he adopt a 
    new title for Sunday, because it was now in vogue? A reply to these 
    questions would be supererogatory especially to the latter, seeing that the 
    same expression had been used eight times already by St. Luke, St. Paul and 
    St. Peter, <em>all under divine inspiration,</em> and surely the Holy Spirit 
    would not inspire St. John to call Sunday the Lord's day, whilst He inspired 
    Sts. Luke, Paul, and Peter, collectively, to entitle the day of judgment 
    &quot;the Lord's day.&quot; Dialecticians reckon amongst the infallible motives of 
    certitude, the moral motive of analogy or induction, by which we are enabled 
    to conclude with certainty from the known to the unknown; being absolutely 
    certain of the meaning of an expression can have only the same meaning when 
    uttered the ninth time, especially when we know that on the nine occasions 
    the expressions were <em>inspired by the Holy Spirit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Nor are the strongest intrinsic grounds wanting to prove that 
    this, like its sister texts, contains the same meaning. St. John (Apoc. 
    first chapter, tenth verse) says &quot;I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; 
    &quot;but he furnishes us the key to this expression, chapter four, first and 
    second verses: &quot;After this I looked and behold a door opened in heaven.&quot; A 
    voice said to him: &quot;Come up hither, and I will show you <em>the things which 
    must be hereafter.&quot;</em> Let us ascend in spirit with John. Whither? — 
    through that &quot;door in heaven,&quot; to heaven. And what shall we see? — &quot;The 
    things that must be hereafter,&quot; chapter four, first verse. He ascended in 
    spirit to heaven. He was ordered to write, in full, his vision of what is to 
    take place antecedent to, and concomitantly with, &quot;the Lord's day,&quot; or the 
    day of judgment; the expression &quot;Lord's day&quot; being confined in Scripture to 
    the day of judgment exclusively. </p>
    <p align="right">—<em> <a href="chalng.html">The Catholic Mirror</a></em> of 
    Sept. 23, 1893.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer of the <i>The Catholic Mirror</i> 
  article rejects the notion that &quot;the Lord's day&quot; of Revelation 1:10 refers to 
  Sunday, because in the biblical context, &quot;the Lord's day&quot; of Revelation 1:10 
  simply <i>cannot</i> mean Sunday. There is another meaning of the phrase 
  indicated strongly in scripture, but overlooked by <i>The Catholic Mirror</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 12:8 <font color="#FF0000">For the Son of man is Lord even of the 
    sabbath day.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 2:28 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of 
    the sabbath.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 6:5 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">That the Son of man 
    is Lord also of the sabbath.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that in Isaiah 58:13 the Lord called the seventh day 
  Sabbath &quot;my holy day&quot;? In the above verses it is also quite clear that Jesus 
  Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath day, referring to the biblical Sabbath, the 
  Sabbath instituted at creation and written on tables of stone by the finger of 
  God (Exo. 20:8-11). The only day of the week John would have considered to be 
  &quot;the Lord's day&quot; was not Sunday, but the biblical seventh day Saturday Sabbath 
  spoken of by Jesus Himself as &quot;my holy day&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat goes on to say that those who pick a day 
  other than Sunday to rest are fighting the culture, and will find keeping any 
  other day but Sunday very hard if not impossible.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>The Sabbath versus Sports and Shopping</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;In America, the Sabbath no longer belongs 
  to Jehovah God, but to the gods of professional sports.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is that God has no problem with 
  Super Bowl Sunday, or sports on <u>any</u> Sunday. Neither does God have a 
  problem with commerce or shopping on Sunday. Sunday is <u>not</u> &quot;the Lord's 
  day&quot;, it is <u>not</u> the Sabbath of the Bible. Sunday is just one of the six 
  days on which work is <u>allowed</u> by God. Sunday sacredness is nothing more 
  than a Tradition of Men that makes void the law of God. It is <u>impossible</u> 
  to violate or keep the Sabbath of the Lord on the first day of the week, 
  Sunday. The biblical Sabbath day is Saturday, the seventh day of the week, 
  specified by God, and either you keep it or break it on that day.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>An Example of God's Blessing</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chick-fil-A restaurants, which are 
  closed on Sundays in an honest but misguided effort to keep the Sabbath 
  commandment, are presented as an example of how prosperous one can be when 
  keeping Sunday a holy rest. The Pharisees likely thought that a rich man (Luke 
  16:19-31) was blessed by God in his prosperity, and surely saved, yet he was 
  actually lost!&nbsp; In a similar manner, the apparent success of Chick-fil-A 
  restaurants does not prove that God is pleased by Sunday keeping.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>God Knows Best</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;... failing to take a day of rest as 
    commanded by God causes us to miss tremendous benefits that could be ours. 
    By not honoring the Sabbath, we are missing out on blessings that would keep 
    strong the fabric of our nation, our communities, our families, and 
    ourselves. ... We therefore should ask ourselves, Will we receive the 
    blessing of the Lord and the heritage of Jacob [Isaiah 58:13-14], or will we 
    experience emotional burnout? The choice is ours.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Pat Robertson wants to adhere to Isaiah 
  58:13-14 as a standard, he is to be commended in principle, but he needs to 
  admit it speaks only about Saturday, not Sunday, and <u>then</u> seek to 
  repair the breach:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Isa 58:12 And <i>they that shall be</i> of thee shall build 
    the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many 
    generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The 
    restorer of paths to dwell in.<br>
    Isa 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, <i>from</i> doing thy 
    pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the 
    LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor 
    finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <i>thine own</i> words:<br>
    Isa 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee 
    to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage 
    of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Pat Robertson rightly stated:&nbsp;&quot;We 
  violate God's Fourth Commandment at our peril.&quot; There is a prophesied breach 
  in God's law (Dan 7:25) that needs to be repaired, but that repair cannot be 
  effected by keeping Sunday. If Pat Robertson, or you dear reader, truly wish 
  to keep the true Sabbath of the Lord God, as the Bible teaches, it can only be 
  done on Saturday, the seventh day. Then you will be rightly called, &quot;The 
  repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.&quot; </p>
