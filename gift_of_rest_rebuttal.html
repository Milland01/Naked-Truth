  <hr>
  <p>There is an increasing tendency by Christians in America to defend the 
  public display of the Ten Commandments in the courtrooms and other state or 
  federal governmental buildings, in an effort to publicize the foundational 
  nature of God's Law in the fabric of the nation's legal system, and promote 
  their enduring value to the general welfare and safety of the public at large. 
  This puts the majority of Christian pastors in a very awkward position when it 
  comes to preaching the value of observing the Ten Commandments, because when 
  it comes to the Sabbath commandment (third by Catholic count, and fourth by 
  some Protestants), the Sunday keeping preacher needs to explain, somehow to 
  his congregation, just why it is that God's eternal law commands the keeping 
  of the <i>seventh</i> day (Saturday), but that is no longer valid<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;</font>that 
  God's Law has been changed, and it is now the <i>first</i> day of the week 
  (Sunday) that should be kept holy today by Christians.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A diligent search of the New Testament will discover no command from Jesus 
  or the Apostles to cease keeping the Sabbath, or that it has been replaced by 
  the first day of the week, yet the Sunday keeping Protestant pastor finds 
  himself in the predicament of exhorting his congregation to keep Sunday, in 
  striking contradiction to God's clear command to keep the seventh day Saturday 
  Sabbath. On November 4th, 2001, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Fort 
  Lauderdale Florida, broadcast on television a remarkable sermon by Dr. D. 
  James Kennedy, where this dilemma of Sunday sacredness, and the change of 
  God's Law, was addressed. Excerpts from his full length televised sermon have 
  been transcribed and are presented in the blue boxes. These excerpts are

        <blockquote>
          <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
          Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
          Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in 
          it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, 
          thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger 
          that is within thy gates:<br>
          Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and 
          all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD 
          blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
          <p>Isa 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing 
          thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy 
          of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own 
          ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:<br>
          Isa 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will 
          cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee 
          with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath 
          spoken it.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>May God speak to our hearts through his holy word and may His name 
        ever be praised. Amen.</p>
        <p>God so loved the human race that he gave us - the Sabbath. When you 
        think about that, you will realize how remarkable that is. He is, why He 
        is the boss. He is the ultimate authority, and what have we heard all of 
        our lives from such folks as that. Get up off your duff and get to work! 
        What are you doing there lazy? Get going! Move! Push! Lift! Work! WORK! 
        WORK! God says, rest. Sabbath from the Hebrew <i>shabbat</i> means, very 
        simply, rest. He gave us a day of rest. When everybody else, from the 
        task masters of the Pharaoh with their whips, down to the slave owners 
        of the South in this country, where saying work, lift, push, haul, God 
        says <i>rest</i>, my Son, <i>rest</i> my daughter. The amazing thing is 
        that there are some people who are so thick-headed that they won't do 
        it.&nbsp;<br>

  <p>Now here Dr. Kennedy departs from biblical truth and mixes in the 
  traditions of men. Sunday, the first day of the week, is <i>never</i> 
  designated in scripture to be a Sabbath day.&nbsp;</p>

        <td width="100%">God so loved the human race that He gave us the 
        Sabbath. In fact, before the state, before the church, before even the 
        family, the first institution that God gave to mankind was the Sabbath. 
        Having created the heavens and the earth and all things therein, he 
        rested on the seventh day and blessed the seventh day and hallowed it. 
        And He commands us to keep it as such, because He loves us. And if we 
        love Him we will love His Sabbath.<br>
        ...
        <p>The Sabbath, the first institution given to man, is one that is 
        vitally important. It is the longest commandment of the ten, more words 
        dedicated to that throughout the rest of the scripture, mentioned more 
        than virtually any other, and it was a very <i>serious</i> matter. God 
        intended us to <i>keep</i> it. There is an old saying that goes, 'As 
        goes the Sabbath, so goes the nation', because when the Sabbath becomes 
        profaned and desecrated, church attendance is ignored, the teaching of 
        God's holy word and His morality and spiritual life is forgotten, and 
        the nation sinks deeper and deeper into the mire of sin. And that has a 
        profound negative impact upon any country.</td>

  <p>What Dr. Kennedy says here about the Sabbath is indeed true, but God <i>
  never</i> refers to the first day of the week, Sunday, as a day to be kept 
  holy and to rest. <b>

  <p>As bible believing Christians can see for themselves, Sunday was never 
  proclaimed in scripture to be the new Sabbath to replace the seventh day 
  Sabbath. There are no biblical exhortations to rest on the first day of the 
  week, and no biblical penalties decreed for profaning Sunday by working that 
  day. Now Protestantism was founded largely on the principle of Sola Scriptura, 
  the Bible only for doctrine, and there is no Bible decree that declares the 
  keeping of Sunday holy. The keeping of Sunday is, in fact, a tradition of men.</p>

        say that we are not even supposed to be worshipping on the first day of

        the seventh day of the week. And the commandment <i>is</i> &quot;Six days

        God&quot;. How did we go, they will ask, from being, Saturday being the 
        Sabbath, to Sunday being the Sabbath. Who changed the Law? Well, seventh 
        day celebrators, Seventh-day Adventists who celebrate Sabbath on the 
        seventh day, will usually tell you that is was Constantine, in the early 
        300's, 325 A.D. that had the temerity to take upon himself, the 
        authority, simply because he was the Caesar of Rome, to change the 
        Sabbath day from Saturday to Sunday. Do you buy that? Think about it. 
        Like for example, the Romans had no Sabbath at all. Saturday, Tuesday, 
        Thursday, Friday, Sunday, none! They had no Sabbath to change. What 
        Constantine simply did, was, make Sunday a legal holiday so that they 
        wouldn't have to worship in the catacombs before light on early Sunday 
        morning and then go to work. He would not certainly have wanted to 
        jeopardize the support of all of the millions of Christians that had 
        grown up in those three centuries, that had allowed him to take over the 
        Roman empire, by changing their day. Can you imagine what would happen 
        if some Presidential candidate had said, while running for this 
        presidency in this election, that he was going to change the Sabbath day 
        to Tuesday? Why he wouldn't have had a chance of being elected. Neither 
        would Constantine have had a chance of ruling Rome. But <i>it was 
        changed by Christ, and by His Apostles by their example.</i>&nbsp;</td>

  <p>In the above part of his sermon, Dr. Kennedy now introduces what is called 
  by apologists a &quot;straw man&quot;. A straw man is a misrepresentation of an 
  opponents argument in order to make it easy to refute. He asserts that 
  Seventh-day Adventists teach that Constantine is responsible for changing the 
  seventh day Saturday Sabbath over to Sunday. That is his straw man, and he 
  then proceeds to demolish this notion. However, Dr. Kennedy provided no 
  authoritative Seventh-day Adventist sources as documentation of his claim. 
  Adventists have long acknowledged that Sunday keeping got its start long 
  before Constantine, and we do <i>not</i> attribute the change to Sunday to 
  Constantine. Here is what Adventists have actually said about Constantine:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... Himself a worshiper of the sun in the form of Apollo, Constantine was 
    willing to recognize Jesus Christ—&quot;the Sun of Righteousness&quot;—as another 
    manifestation of the sun deity. In certain similarities between the church 
    and paganism that had resulted from reciprocal borrowing, he at first 
    thought he saw an opportunity for forging a unified imperial sun cult, 
    uniting Christians and sun worshipers. His nominal conversion to 
    Christianity did not take place until 323 or 325. ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Constantine legalized the church in 313 it was forced to 
    review its opinion of the state, and it hailed a benevolent government as 
    its friend. Constantine followed his decree of liberation with other decrees 
    favoring the church in its various operations, with grants of funds, of 
    privileges, and of powers, both judicial and executive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since many Christians had been using Sunday as a day of worship for 
    more than a century and a half, and since many sun worshipers had come to 
    regard the first day of the week as the special astrological &quot;day of the 
    sun,&quot; he issued the world’s first Sunday law (321), calling for rest from 
    labor on that day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantine did not make Christianity the state religion, but in 
    some respects a bureau of the state. The church accepted these seeming 
    benefits with gratification, not realizing the inherent danger in them until 
    the question arose as to whether the state should dominate the church.</p>

    <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early part of the fourth century the emperor 
    Constantine issued a decree making Sunday a public festival throughout the 
    Roman Empire. The day of the sun was reverenced by his pagan subjects and 
    was honored by Christians; it was the emperor's policy to unite the 
    conflicting interests of heathenism and Christianity. He was urged to do 
    this by the bishops of the church, who, inspired by ambition and thirst for 
    power, perceived that if the same day was observed by both Christians and 
    heathen, it would promote the nominal acceptance of Christianity by pagans 
    and thus advance the power and glory of the church. But while many 
    God-fearing Christians were gradually led to regard Sunday as possessing a 
    degree of sacredness, they still held the true Sabbath as the holy of the 
    Lord and observed it in obedience to the fourth commandment.&nbsp;</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that Seventh-day Adventists agree with Dr. Kennedy that Sunday keeping
  <i>predates</i> Constantine. What the pagan emperor Constantine did, was 
  officially establish Sunday as a legal civil holiday for the Roman Empire:</p>
  <p><b><u>First Sunday Law Decreed by Constantine</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing 
    in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country, however, 
    persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their 
    pursuits; because it often happens that another day is not so suitable for 
    grain-sowing or for vine-planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for 
    such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost. (Given the 7th day of 
    March, Crispus and Constantine being consuls each of them for the second 
    time [a.d. 321].)</p>

    <p>Constantine is the founder, in part at least, of the <i>civil</i> 
    observance of Sunday, by which alone the religious observance of it in the 
    church could be made universal and could be properly secured… [p. 380] But 
    the Sunday law of Constantine must not be overrated… There is no reference 
    whatever in his law either to the fourth commandment or to the resurrection 
    of Christ. Besides he expressly exempted the country districts, where 
    paganism still prevailed, from the prohibition of labor… Christians and 
    pagans had been accustomed to festival rests; Constantine made these rests 
    to synchronize, and gave the preference to Sunday.</p>

  <p>Now, had Constantine made the change from Saturday to Sunday, as Dr. 
  Kennedy asserts that Adventists say, there would have to be some statement 
  from the emperor transferring the Saturday Sabbath rest to Sunday, but this is
  <i>not</i> in his decree, cited above. So if Constantine did <i>not</i> make 
  this change, who did?&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But notwithstanding all the efforts to establish Sunday 
    sacredness, papists themselves publicly confessed the divine authority of 
    the Sabbath, and the human origin of the institution by which it had been 
    supplanted. In the sixteenth century a papal council plainly declared: &quot;Let 
    all Christians remember that the seventh day was consecrated by God, and 
    hath been received and observed, not only by the Jews, but by all others who 
    pretend to worship God; though we Christians have changed their Sabbath into 
    the Lord's day.&quot; [Thomas Morer (1651-1715)<i>, Kyriake hemera = Discourse in Six Dialogues on the Name,

  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Satan's chief agent in bringing about the rejection of the 
    fourth commandment, and the institution of the first day of the week as a 
    day of rest, has been the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church 
    does not deny the part she has acted in this change, but makes a boast of 
    her power as shown in the change which she has brought about in the world. 
    Papists acknowledge that the Bible gives no sanction to this change, and 
    that Protestants have no Scriptural authority for Sunday worship. The 
    Catholic Church changed the day of rest from the seventh to the first day, 
    and without the shadow of divine sanction it has been accepted by almost all 
    the Protestant churches, and Rome, pointing to the adherents of her 
    doctrines, claims the supremacy. In changing the fourth precept of God's 
    law, the papal power has thought itself able to exalt itself above all that 
    is called God, or that is worshipped. This was the very work that the 
    prophesy foretold would be done by this power.</p>

  <p><b><u>Pope Sylvester I (314-335 A.D.) Decrees the Transfer of Sabbath Rest 
  to Sunday:</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> 
    (776-856), abbot of Fulda and later archbishop of Mainz, Germany, was rated 
    one of the greatest theologians of his age and probably the most cultured 
    man of his time, and exceptionally learned in patristics. Besides, he was a 
    zealous defender of the papacy and its teachings. In one of his works, he 
    says,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pope Sylvester instructed the clergy to keep the <i>feriae</i>. And, 
      indeed, from an old custom he called the first day [of the week] the 
      &quot;Lord's [day],&quot; on which the light was made in the beginning and also the 
      resurrection of Christ is celebrated.<sup>6</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Rabanus Maurus does not mean to say that Sylvester was the first man who 
    referred to the days of the week as <i>feriae</i> or who first started the 
    observance of Sunday among Christians. He means that, according to the 
    testimony of Roman Catholic writers, Sylvester confirmed those practices and 
    made them official insofar as his church was concerned. Hence Rabanus says 
    elsewhere in his writings:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pope Sylvester first among the Romans ordered that the names of the 
      days [of the week], which they previously called after the name of their 
      gods, that is, [the day] of the Sun, [the day] of the Moon, [the day] of 
      Mars, [the day] of Mercury, [the day] of Jupiter, [the day] of Venus, [the 
      day] of Saturn, they should call <i>feriae</i> thereafter, that is the 
      first <i>feria, </i>the second <i>feria, </i>the third <i>feria, </i>the 
      fourth <i>feria, </i>the fifth <i>feria, </i>the sixth <i>feria,</i> 
      because that in the beginning of Genesis it is written that God said 
      concerning each day: on the first, &quot;Let there be light:; on the second, 
      &quot;Let there be a firmament&quot;; on the third, &quot;Let the earth bring forth 
      verdure&quot;; etc. But he [Sylvester] ordered [them] to call the Sabbath by 
      the ancient term of the law, [to call] the first <i>feria</i> the &quot;Lord's 
      day,&quot; because on it the Lord rose [from the dead], Moreover, the same pope 
      decreed that the rest of the Sabbath should be transferred rather to the 
      Lord's day [Sunday], in order that on that day we should rest from worldly 
      works for the praise of God.<sup>7</sup></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note particularly, he says that &quot;the same pope [Sylvester I] decreed that 
    the rest of the Sabbath should be transferred rather to the Lord's day 
    [Sunday].&quot;<sup>8</sup> According to this statement, he was the first bishop 
    to introduce the idea that the divinely appointed rest of the Sabbath day 
    should be transferred to the first day of the week. This is significant, 
    especially in view of the fact that it was during Sylvester's pontificate 
    that the emperor of Rome [Constantine] issued the first civil laws 
    compelling men to rest from secular labor on Sunday, and that Eusebius, 
    bishop of&nbsp; Caesarea, was the first theologian on record to present 
    arguments, allegedly from the Scriptures, that Christ did transfer the rest 
    of the Sabbath day to Sunday.</p>

  <p>The Roman Catholic church, as demonstrated above, stands up and says they 
  have made the change, in the 4th century. They claim to have transferred the 
  rest of the Saturday Sabbath to Sunday, and can show the historical proof in 
  the canons of the Council of Laodicea in the 4th century. The

  <a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-14/2ancyra/Laocns.htm">Council of 
  Laodicea</a></b> in Phrygia Pacatiana, (343-381) was a local, Eastern, 
  Greek-speaking synod, and the canons referring to the Sabbath or Sunday/Lord's 
  day are listed here:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>LAODICEA, CANON 16. - The Gospels are to be read on Sabbath, with the 
    other Scriptures [apparently at Communion services; see canon 49, below].</p>
    <p>LAODICEA, CANON 29. - Christians must not judaize by resting on the 
    Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honoring the Lord's Day; and, if 
    they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be 
    judaizers, let them be anathema from Christ.</p>
    <p>LAODICEA, CANON 49. - During Lent, the Bread must not be offered except 
    on the Sabbath Day and on the Lord's Day only.</p>
    <p>LAODICEA, CANON 51. - The nativities of Martyrs [actually, the death 
    days, on which martyrs were considered to have been born to eternal life] 
    are not to be celebrated in Lent, but commemorations of the holy Martyrs are 
    to be made on the Sabbaths and Lord's days.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Constantine, while still a heathen, issued a decree 
    enjoining the general observance of Sunday as a public festival throughout 
    the Roman empire. After his conversion, he remained a staunch advocate of 
    Sunday, and his pagan edict was then enforced by him in the interests of his 
    new faith. But the honor shown this day was not as yet sufficient to prevent 
    Christians from regarding the true Sabbath as the holy of the Lord. Another 
    step must be taken; the false Sabbath must be exalted to an equality with 
    the true. A few years after the issue of Constantine's decree, the bishop of 
    Rome [Sylvester] conferred on the Sunday the title of Lord's day. Thus the 
    people were gradually led to regard it as possessing a degree of sacredness. 
    Still the original Sabbath was kept.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The arch-deceiver had not completed his work. He was 
    resolved to gather the Christian world under his banner, and to exercise his 
    power through his vicegerent, the proud pontiff who claimed to be the 
    representative of Christ. Through half-converted pagans, ambitious prelates, 
    and world-loving churchmen, he accomplished his purpose. Vast councils were 
    held, from time to time, in which the dignitaries of the church were 
    convened from all the world. In nearly every council the Sabbath which God 
    had instituted was pressed down a little lower, while the Sunday was 
    correspondingly exalted. Thus the pagan festival came finally to be honored 
    as a divine institution, while the Bible Sabbath was pronounced a relic of 
    Judaism, and its observers were declared to be accursed.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The great apostate had succeeded in exalting himself &quot;above all 
    that is called God, or that is worshiped.&quot; [2 Thess. 2:4.] He had dared to 
    change the only precept of the divine law that unmistakably points all 
    mankind to the true and living God. In the fourth commandment, God is 
    revealed as the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and is thereby 
    distinguished from all false gods. It was as a memorial of the work of 
    creation that the seventh day was sanctified as a rest-day for man. It was 
    designed to keep the living God ever before the minds of men as the source 
    of being and the object of reverence and worship. Satan strives to turn men 
    from their allegiance to God, and from rendering obedience to his law; 
    therefore he directs his efforts especially against that commandment which 
    points to God as the Creator.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Protestants now urge that the resurrection of Christ on 
    Sunday, made it the Christian Sabbath. But Scripture evidence is lacking. No 
    such honor was given to the day by Christ or his apostles. The observance of 
    Sunday as a Christian institution has its origin in that &quot;mystery of 
    lawlessness&quot; which, even in Paul's day, had begun its work. Where and when 
    did the Lord adopt this child of the papacy? What valid reason can be given 
    for a change concerning which the Scriptures are silent?&nbsp;</b></p>

  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>This attempted change of a commandment of God is actually prophesied in 
  scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;Dan 7:25 And he [the little horn] shall speak great words against the 
    most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and <b><i>think 
    to change times and laws </i></b>[of the most High ]: and they shall be 
    given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Daniel was speaking about the antichrist power, who would think to change 
  the times and laws of God, and only one of the Ten Commandments of the Law of 
  God deals with time, the commandment to keep holy <i>the</i> seventh day. For 
  over one hundred years Seventh-day Adventists have clearly taught that this 
  change from Sabbath to Sunday, an act of papal Rome, is in fact the mark of 
  authority of the beast, spoken of in the book of Revelation.</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p>... &quot;He shall think to change times and laws.&quot; The change in the fourth 
    commandment exactly fulfills the prophecy. For this change the only 
    authority claimed is that of the church. Here the papal power openly sets 
    itself above God.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The claim so often put forth, that Christ changed the Sabbath, is 
    disproved by his own words. In his sermon on the mount he declared: &quot;Think 
    not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to 
    destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth 
    pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be 
    fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, 
    and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of 
    Heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called 
    great in the kingdom of Heaven.&quot; [Matt 5:17-19.]&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Roman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the Sabbath 
    was made by their church; and they cite this change as evidence of the 
    authority of the church to legislate in divine things, and declare that 
    Protestants, by observing the Sabbath as thus changed, are recognizing her 
    power. The Roman Church has not relinquished her claim to supremacy; and 
    when the world and the Protestant churches accept a Sabbath of her creating, 
    while they reject the Bible Sabbath, they virtually admit this assumption. 
    They may claim the authority of apostles and Fathers for the change; but in 
    so doing they ignore the very principle which separates them from 
    Rome,--that &quot;the Bible, and the Bible only, is the religion of Protestants.&quot; 
    The papist can see that they are deceiving themselves, willingly closing 
    their eyes to the facts in the case. As the Sunday institution gains favor, 
    he rejoices, feeling assured that it will eventually bring the whole 
    Protestant world under the banner of Rome.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth commandment, which Rome has endeavored to set aside, is 
    the only precept of the decalogue that points to God as the Creator of the 
    heavens and the earth, and thus distinguishes the true God from all false 
    gods. The Sabbath was instituted to commemorate the work of creation, and 
    thus to direct the minds of men to the true and living God. The fact of his 
    creative power is cited throughout the Scriptures as proof that the God of 
    Israel is superior to heathen deities. Had the Sabbath always been kept, 
    man's thoughts and affections would have been led to his Maker as the object 
    of reverence and worship, and there would never have been an idolater, an 
    atheist, or an infidel.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That institution which points to God as the Creator is a 
    sign of his rightful authority over the beings he has made. The change of 
    the Sabbath is the sign, or mark, of the authority of the Romish Church. 
    Those who, understanding the claims of the fourth commandment, choose to 
    observe the false in place of the true Sabbath, are thereby paying homage to 
    that power by which alone it is commanded. The change in the fourth 
    commandment is the change pointed out in the prophecy, and the keeping of 
    the counterfeit Sabbath is the reception of the mark. But Christians of past 
    generations observed the first day, supposing that they were keeping the 
    Bible Sabbath, and there are in the churches of to-day many who honestly 
    believe that Sunday is the Sabbath of divine appointment. None of these have 
    received the mark of the beast. There are true Christians in every church, 
    not excepting the Roman Catholic communion. The test upon this question does 
    not come until Sunday observance is enforced by law, and the world is 
    enlightened concerning the obligation of the true Sabbath. Not until the 
    issue is thus plainly set before the people, and they are brought to choose 
    between the commandments of God and the commandments of men, will those who 
    continue in transgression receive the mark of the beast.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>[pg. 53]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>When Protestants do profane work upon Saturday, or the 
    seventh day of the week, do they follow the Scripture as their only rule of 
    faith?</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. On the contrary, they have only the authority of tradition for 
    this practice. In profaning Saturday, they violate one of God's 
    commandments, which he has never clearly abrogated; &quot;Remember thou keep holy 
    the Sabbath day.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>Is the observance of Sunday, as the day of rest, a matter 
    clearly laid down in Scripture?<br>
    </i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It certainly is not; and yet all Protestants consider 
    the observance of this particular day as essentially necessary to salvation. 
    To say, we observe the Sunday, because Christ rose from the dead on that 
    day, is to say, that we should rest on Thursday, because Christ ascended to 
    heaven on that day, and rested in reality from the work of redemption.</p>
    <p>[ pg. 54]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <i>What do you conclude from all this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. That Protestants have no Scripture for the measure of their 
    day of rest; that they abolish the observance of Saturday without warrant of 
    Scripture; that they substitute Sunday in its place without scriptural 
    authority; consequently, that for all this, they have only traditional 
    authority. Yet Protestants would look upon a man who would do profane work 
    after five o'clock on Sunday, or keep the Saturday, and profane the first 
    day, as a victim of perdition. Hence we must conclude, that the Scripture, 
    which does not teach these things clearly, does not contain all necessary 
    truths; and, consequently, cannot be the only rule of faith.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; [ pg. 108]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <em>Have you any other way of proving that the church has power 
    to institute festivals of precept?</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all 
    modern religionists agree with her - she could not have substituted the 
    observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the observance of 
    Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural 
    authority.</p>

  <p>(cf. Matt 16:21; Luke 24:1).</p>
  <p>Yes, Christ did rise from the dead on the first day of the week, but that 
  was mere coincidence. You see, the crucifixion day (Passover) was to be 
  celebrated every year on 14th day of the first month (Nisan), by God's 
  direction:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's 
    passover.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now Passover has been celebrated every year, since Israel was freed from 
  bondage in Egypt, on the 14th day of the first month, by God's calendar. This 
  feast day, as it was set for a day of the month, varied from one year to 
  another as to the day of the week it fell on (just as your birthday can be a 
  different day from one year to the next). Now it is true that on the year of 
  the crucifixion, Passover happened on a Friday, placing the resurrection day, 
  the 3rd day, on Sunday. However, if Christians were going to celebrate the 
  dates <i>set by God</i>, it would be the 14th of Nisan for the crucifixion, 
  and 16 Nisan for the resurrection.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is also worth noting that neither Passover (14 Nisan), nor resurrection 
  day (16 Nisan) were to be observed as convocation/sabbath days, but the day <i>
  between</i> them, the first day of the feast of Unleaven Bread, <i>was</i> a 
  Sabbath day:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of 
    unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.<br>
    Lev 23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no 
    servile work therein.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So what warrant is there for keeping Sunday as a Sabbath, when there is 
  simply no &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; in the Bible for Sunday sacredness to honor 
  the resurrection? Dr. Kennedy suggests the following:</p>

  <p>John 20:19-28</p>
  <p>Late on the day of the resurrection Jesus did appear to the eleven 
  Apostles, but were they then told by Jesus to begin keeping that day instead 
  of the seventh day Sabbath? The scriptures are quite silent on that point.</p>

  <p>Acts 2:1; 20:16, 1 Cor 16:8</p>
  <p>Yes, since 16 Nisan was on a Sunday the year of the crucifixion, Pentecost, 
  fifty days later, also fell on a Sunday. But why were the Apostles gathered 
  together on that day?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with 
    one accord in one place.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You see, it was because it was Pentecost that they were gathered together. 
  Like Passover, Pentecost varies as to the day of the week it falls on, that is 
  if you follow God's calendar. That Passover was on a Sunday was coincidence. 
  Where in scripture does it indicate that the Christians began keeping 
  Pentecost always on Sunday from that year forward? There is no such record in 
  scripture, because the apostolic church knew nothing of a change to Sunday 
  sacredness.</p>

  <p>Acts 20:7</p>
  <p>The presumption being presented here is that the &quot;breaking of bread&quot; 
  indicated the Lord's Supper.&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came 
    together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the 
    morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then what of the following verse:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and 
    breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and 
    singleness of heart,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It seems clear that &quot;breaking of bread&quot; indicates simply eating a meal 
  together, but does not necessarily mean the celebration of the Lord's Supper. 
  But let's assume for a moment that in Acts 20:7 the Apostles did in fact have 
  communion, after all, Paul did preach until midnight. Why were they gathered 
  together? Scripture tells us, because Paul was departing the next morning, 
  there is <i>nothing</i> in the text that tells us they were gathered together 
  because it was the new Sunday Sabbath. This is a remarkable omission, if the 
  Apostles were indeed keeping Sundays.</p>

  <p>1 Cor 16:2</p>
  <p>Here Paul encourages the Corinthians, at the beginning of each week, to set 
  aside a portion of their income, so that when he arrives the offerings for the 
  Jerusalem church will have already been allocated. However, there is not even 
  the slightest hint here of a church service, or the keeping of Sundays by the 
  Corinthian church. Note the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 18:1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to 
    Corinth;<br>
    Acts 18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the 
    Jews and the Greeks.<br>
    Acts 18:11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word 
    of God among them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That's 72 Sabbaths that Paul preached in Corinth, preaching to Jews and 
  Gentiles. There can be no question that Paul raised up a Sabbath keeping 
  church in Corinth, a church that knew nothing of observing Sunday as a holy 
  day. So there is simply no reason to suggest that 1 Cor 16:2 demonstrates the 
  keeping of Sunday by Paul or the Corinthian church.</p>
  <p>Rev 1:10</p>
  <p>That John means Sunday here is pure speculation. While Sunday has become 
  known through Tradition as the Lord's day, scripture does not designate it as 
  such, but we can find the following, referring to the Saturday sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 12:8 <font color="#FF0000">For the Son of man is Lord even of the 
    sabbath day.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 2:28 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of 
    the sabbath.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 6:5 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">That the Son of man 
    is Lord also of the sabbath.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above verses it is quite clear that Jesus Christ 
  is the Lord of the Sabbath day, referring to the biblical sabbath, the sabbath 
  instituted at creation and written on tables of stone by the finger of God 
  (Exo. 20:8-11). The only day of the week John would have considered to be &quot;the 
  Lord's day&quot; was not Sunday, but the biblical seventh day Saturday Sabbath 
  spoken of by Jesus Himself.</p>

  <p>There are 18 instances in which the phrase &quot;eighth day&quot; occurs in the Old 
  Testament:</p>
  <p align="center"><b><u>EIGHTH DAY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</u></b></p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Exo 22:30</b> Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy

    <li><b>Neh 8:18</b> Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day,

    saith the Lord GOD. (Eighth day of dedicating the altar, v. 18)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note that <i>none</i> of the above verses says the &quot;eighth day of the 
  week&quot;. I maintain that when studied in context, not one of these verses refers 
  to the first day of the week. It is incumbent upon Dr. Kennedy to provide the 
  proof that <i>even one</i> of the above Old Testament verses is intended to 
  indicate the first day of the week. This he will not be able to do.<br>
  <br>
  In the New Testament, the phrase &quot;eighth day&quot; appears in three verses:</p>
  <p align="center"><b><u>EIGHTH DAY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</u></b></p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Luke 1:59</b>&nbsp; And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they 
    came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name 
    of his father.</li>
    <li><b>Acts 7:8</b> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so 
    Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat 
    Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</li>
    <li><b>Phil 3:5</b> Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of 
    the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a 
    Pharisee;</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In each case the New Testament is referring to circumcision on the eighth 
  day after birth (Gen. 17:12), which has <i>no connection what-so-ever to the 
  first day of the week</i>.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So I would submit, that Dr. Kennedy's claim that the &quot;eighth day&quot;, in every 
  instance in scripture refers to Sunday, is <i>without merit</i>. On the 
  contrary, scripture <i>never</i> designates the first day of the week as the 
  &quot;eighth day.&quot;</p>
  <p>Dr. Kennedy continues with these early fathers of the Church:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Justin Martyr - Sunday communion (150 A.D.)</li>
    <li>Clement of Alexandria - keeping the Lord's day, Sunday (194 A.D.)</li>
    <li>Tertullian - solemnized the day <i>after</i> Saturday (200 A.D.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, for the Protestant, appeals to early church fathers is a violation 
  of the Sola Scriptura principle, and so has no standing or validity in the 
  establishment of doctrine. If the case cannot be made from the Bible, then no 
  amount of testimony from early church fathers has any standing.</p>

  <p><b><u>Not one scintilla of scriptural proof that Sunday is divinely 
  appointed:</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And now we would ask upon what religious grounds these 
    earnest advocates for a more strict observance of Sunday [Protestants] base 
    their claims to make Sunday a day of worship. If all the new law is 
    contained in the Scripture, there is not one scintilla of proof that it is 
    the divinely appointed day. Their citadel is not built upon sand—its 
    condition is worse, it has no foundation at all. It is said in Holy Writ 
    that &quot;on the first day of the week the disciples were gathered for prayer 
    and the breaking of bread.&quot; It is also said that on &quot;another occasion, they 
    were gathered for the same purpose on the first day of the week to hear St. 
    Paul, who preached until midnight.&quot; St. John, it is said, was in the spirit 
    on &quot;the Lord's day.&quot; But this is a mere recital of facts, it is not the 
    promulgation of a law. It is not the language, nor does it carry the 
    sanction of a law. Who then, made Sunday, the first day of the week, the 
    newly appointed day of worship? The divine organism that traces its history 
    through the centuries back to Christ, that received the commission, &quot;Go and 
    teach all nations;&quot; that received from the hands of Christ, the divine 
    founder of the new covenant, the new law of worship, in whose hands was 
    placed the gift of infallible truth. To that divine organization, the 
    Catholic Church, was given the law of worship, and she alone decreed and she 
    alone had the right to decree that Sunday, the first day of the week, should 
    be the future day of religious worship. The substance remained as St. Paul 
    says and the victim of her altars was to be worshipped. So the substance was 
    preserved; she, therefore, decreed the law, the day of worship and all the 
    ordinances of that worship. All outside of her [Protestants] are fighting 
    from a religious point view for a cause which does not belong to them. The 
    Christian Sunday rests solely upon the teachings of tradition, which they 
    reject.</p>

  Sabbath and Sola Scriptura, or the keeping of the papal Sunday and a

  even in this hectic modern culture, the &quot;Lord's day&quot; <i>can</i> be kept holy 
  by Christians. During his sermon, Dr. Kennedy also advocated that Christians 
  should not even patronize businesses on Sunday, much less open their own 
  businesses that day. Dr. Kennedy is openly asserting that on the Christian 
  Sabbath of Sunday, Christians should refrain from buying or selling. 
  Adventists have known for many years, from scripture, where this will

  is Saturday, not Sunday. As he says, the Sabbath commandment <i>is</i> <u>
  unchangeable</u>, therefore he indeed keeps the Tradition of the papal Sunday, 
  and ignores God's seventh day Saturday Sabbath commandment at his own risk, <i>
  and so, dear reader, do you!</i></p>

  <p>Dr. Kennedy is listed as a supporter of <b> <a href="http://www.tencommandmentsday.com/">&quot;Ten Commandments 
  Day&quot;</a></b>, to be held on Sunday, May 7th, 2006. It will be interesting 
  to hear his sermon for that day, when he will likely again proclaim the need 
  to keep God's Ten Commandments, but it should be noted that the Sabbath of the 
  Lord can only be kept on the seventh day of the week, and that day is, without 
  any doubt, Saturday.</p>
  <p>As far as I was able to determine, Dr. Kennedy took no notice of the first 
  Ten Commandments Sunday on his web sites, or his TV program. He apparently 
  ignored it.</p>

  <p>Dr. Kennedy revisits the Sabbath - Sunday issue in a program broadcast June 
  22, 2006 on his radio show <i>&quot;Truths That Transform&quot;</i>. The program is 
  titled <i>&quot;Eden Revisited (Part 1)&quot;</i> and can be <a href="rtsp://media.coralridge.org/ttt/rm/ttt060622.rm?author='Coral Ridge Ministries'">Downloaded 
  Here.</a></p>
  <p>In his sermon he presents the same basic arguments and misinformation as he 
  did in his previous &quot;Gift of Rest&quot; sermon as documented above, and my rebuttal 
  still applies.</p>
