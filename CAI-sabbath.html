  <p>Jacob Michael resigned from Catholic Apologetics International about May 
  1st, 2003, and the following article by him was subsequently removed from the 
  CAI web site. Here is how the <b><a href="http://www.catholicintl.com/">index

        <td width="100%">When God commanded that the seventh day be honored and 
        hallowed as the Sabbath in the Old Testament, did He ever intend that 
        someday Sunday would be the normal day of Christian worship? The Seventh 
        Day Adventist says no, and it is a mark of the Beast to practice 
        anything but Saturday/Sabbath worship. In this article, Jacob Michael 
        shows how this position is, literally and Scripturally, impossible to 
        defend. </td>

      Adventistism</em>)</b><p></p>
      <p>Which day of the week is the proper day for worshiping God? Is it 
      Saturday? Sunday? Does it even matter? The Jews of the Old Testament 
      certainly thought it did, and by Divine Command they honored the Sabbath 
      day on the seventh day of the week (Saturday), keeping it holy by 
      refraining from labor, on pain of death (under the Mosaic Law).</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
  <p>Two different issues are raised here.</p>
  <p>1.) Which day, Saturday the 7th day of the week, or Sunday the 1st day of 
  the week, is the correct day to worship God?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Note that it is admitted that God's Commandment to remember the 7th day 
    (Saturday) Sabbath day to keep it holy, is relevant to this issue (Exo. 
    20:8-11).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2.) Even if we can establish which day is &quot;proper&quot; (i.e., correct), &quot;does 
  it even matter?&quot;&nbsp; To whom it <i>would</i> matter, in either case, should 
  be addressed.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><b><font size="4">Saturday:</font></b></u> I think it is self evident 
    that since God included the 7th day Sabbath rest in the 10 commandments, 
    written in stone by His own finger on mount Sinai, it is indeed an issue 
    that matters to God at least. Because it clearly mattered to God, it should 
    also matter to those who profess to be His children, whether Jew or Gentile. 
    The keeping of the Commandments of God by the people of God is a theme 
    repeated throughout scripture, Old and New Testament. </p>
    <p>So if it can be established that the 7th day Saturday Sabbath, as 
    specified in the 10 Commandments of God, has never been rescinded by God and 
    continues in effect to this day, then it remains for the people of God to 
    remember it and keep it holy, as He commands:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b><font size="4">The Sabbath Commandment of God</font></b></p>
      <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
      Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
      Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it 
      thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy 
      manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is 
      within thy gates:<br>
      Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
      that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed 
      the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><u><b><font size="4">Sunday:</font></b></u> If on the other hand, it can 
    be <i>proved</i> from scripture that the Saturday Sabbath was replaced by 
    Sunday observance by the Apostles, to honor the resurrection, well<i> then</i> 
    &quot;does it even matter?&quot; Note that if true, this would establish that the 
    Church, based on a presumed authority, could abolish or amend one of the 10 
    Commandments of God. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <h3>The Sunday obligation [of the Roman Catholic Church]</h3>
      <p><b>2180</b> The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord 
      more precisely: &quot;On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful 
      are bound to participate in the Mass.&quot; ...</p>
      <p><b>2181</b> The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of 
      all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to 
      participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused for a 
      serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by 
      their own pastor.[119] Those who deliberately fail in this obligation 
      commit a grave sin. </p>

      of the Catholic Church Online.</a></strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That the Roman Catholic Church commands its people to assist at Sunday 
    Mass each and every Sunday, and that to neglect that duty and deliberately 
    absent oneself from Sunday Mass is said to be committing a grave sin, 
    demonstrates the importance it places on the issue. Sunday worship for the 
    Roman Catholic Church is a foundational issue of paramount importance to 
    establishing their identity as Christians, and to establishing their 
    authority as a Church, authority that even extends over one of the precepts 
    of God, which, as we shall see, they boldly admit changing.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">Today, in the 21st century, this seventh-day literalism 
        is upheld by a group called the Seventh Day Adventists. Like all other 
        Protestant denominations, they claim that their position is biblical, 
        and that to worship on Sunday is to submit to the authority of the Roman 
        Catholic Church. They claim that it is a sign of the antiChrist (whom 
        they associate with the pope) that he will &quot;think to change times and 
        laws&quot; (Dan. 7:25), and that the Catholic Church's transferring of the 
        worship from Saturday to Sunday fulfills this prophecy.
        <p>One author claims: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Plainly the Sabbath day <em>is</em> the Lord’s Day. The Bible 
          itself has cited this fact. But a new question arises: Which day is 
          the Sabbath?... God, Himself, designated Saturday, the seventh day of 
          the week, as the Lord’s Day... at no time do the Biblical writers 
          refer to the first day of the week as the Lord’s Day. Constantly they 
          refer to the Sabbath, never once referring to it as the former Sabbath 
          or in any other way indicating that the seventh day of the week no 
          longer held validity as God’s holy day... If Sabbath observance is the 
          external sign of the seal of the living God, then clearly the 
          adherence to a counterfeit Sabbath, one which God has never blessed or 
          hallowed, is the external sign of the mark of the beast at the close 
          of probationary time.&quot; (The Sunday Law, [www.sundaylaw.net/books/other/standish/plasl/pltoc.htm])
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The Seventh Day Adventists are not fooling around here! This is quite 
        a bold claim, in fact, to say that worshiping on Sunday, the 
        &quot;counterfeit Sabbath,&quot; is the &quot;external sign of the mark of the beast&quot; 
        in Revelation. In other words, if you're not worshiping on Saturday, you 
        bear the mark of the beast, and as anyone who has read about the beast 
        and his mark in Revelation knows, that means you'll be damned with the 
        beast when the Lord returns. </p>
        <p>So how accurate is this claim? Is it true that the bible conclusively 
        supports a seventh-day worship? Was this Mosaic Law never abrogated? Is 
        Sunday worship the mark of a beast-follower, one who has submitted to 
        the rule of the antiChrist pope?</p>
        <p>It is not hard to refute these claims. In fact, we can soundly reject 
        them on two levels, 1) historical, and 2) Scriptural. Let's deal with 
        the words of Scripture first. </td>

          And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, although 
          it was extremely large. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man 
          sitting at the right, wearing a white robe; and they were amazed. And 
          he said to them, &quot;Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the 
          Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen; He is not here; 
          behold, here is the place where they laid Him.&quot; (Mk. 16:2-6) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here we see the first and foremost reason why the early Church began 
        to worship on the first day of the week (Sunday), instead of the seventh 
        day (Saturday). It was on Sunday that the Lord rose from the dead, and 
        thus it was honored as &quot;the Lord's Day.&quot; </td>

  <p>That the resurrection was on a Sunday, I will concede, but no where in the 
  New Testament is <i>any</i> Sunday gathering attributed to honoring the 
  resurrection. Neither does scripture identify the phrase &quot;the Lord's Day&quot; as 
  meaning Sunday, its one and only use being found in Revelation 1:10.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">We can see how quickly this [Sunday worship] practice 
        was introduced into the Church:
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And on the <em>first day of the week</em>, when we were gathered 
          together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to 
          depart the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.&quot; 
          (Acts 20:7) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Does this verse not indicate that Sunday had become the day for 
        regular worship? The Seventh Day Adventist will protest: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Scripture testifies [Acts 20:11] that Paul &quot;had broken bread&quot; on 
          Monday morning. Yet no Christian uses this fact to support Monday 
          sacredness. The fact that bread was broken also on Monday morning 
          seriously diminishes the use of Acts 20:7 as evidence of Sunday 
          sacredness. But this is not all. What does the term &quot;to break bread&quot; 
          mean? Once more Scripture comes to our aid as its own interpreter: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and 
            breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness 
            and singleness of heart (Acts 2:46). </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Notice what this text reveals. Firstly, the early Christians, 
          filled with the power of Pentecost, broke bread daily. So whatever the 
          term &quot;to break bread&quot; meant, it provides absolutely no basis for 
          selecting one of the seven days of the week as the special day of 
          worship, for bread was broken on all days of the week.&quot; (The Sunday 
          Law, [www.sundaylaw.net/books/other/standish/plasl/pltoc.htm]) </p>

  <p>Acts 20:7 may actually indicate that this gathering was on what we would 
  call Saturday night, after sunset, which would by biblical reckoning be the 
  beginning of the first day, Sunday. Paul would then have preached and talked 
  most of the night, departing about sunrise on <i>Sunday</i> morning, rather 
  than Monday morning, not that this has any bearing on the main point being 
  raised, which is that &quot;breaking bread&quot; among the Apostles was clearly not 
  unique to Sunday.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">While it is true that the early Christians broke bread 
        together on a daily basis, and in a meal-like manner, it is also true 
        that &quot;to break bread&quot; also has a liturgical meaning. Observe:
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' 
          teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to the 
          prayers.&quot; (Acts 2:42) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Notice how the definite article is used to describe these activities: 
        &quot;the apostles' teaching,&quot; &quot;the breaking of bread,&quot; and &quot;the prayers.&quot; 
        This is certainly an odd way to describe these events, if indeed they

        liturgical. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>On the contrary, there is no indication at all that &quot;breaking bread&quot; in 
  Acts 2:42 means the new converts were holding a religious service in the sense 
  of a Catholic Mass / Lord's Supper. Rather, having just been baptized (v. 41) 
  they were excited in their newly confessed faith, and continued to gather for 
  agape meals of fellowship, doctrinal/bible study, and prayer on a daily basis 
  (vs. 42, 46).</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">Perhaps an even stronger link between the term &quot;the 
        breaking of bread&quot; and liturgical worship (the Eucharist) is established 
        in the story of the Emmaus Road:
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And behold, two of them were going that very day [the first day of 
          the week] to a village named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from 
          Jerusalem... And it came about that when He had reclined at the table 
          with them, He took the bread and blessed it, and breaking it, He began 
          giving it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; 
          and He vanished from their sight... And they began to relate their 
          experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in <em>the 
          breaking of the bread</em>.&quot; (Luke 24:13, 30-31, 35)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is here, in the liturgical action of the Eucharist, painted in 
        literary terms by St. Luke through the use of the same verbs found in 
        the Last Supper narrative (took, blessed, broke), that the disciples 
        were able to recognize Jesus. Notice how St. Luke uses that odd term 
        again, &quot;the breaking of the bread,&quot; and how this took place on the first 
        day of the week, the day of the Resurrection.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>It would be well to remember that the meal of 14 Nisan, the meal of 
  unleavened bread and wine on the evening of Passover just before the 
  crucifixion, was not a formal religious worship service. It was certainly not 
  the elaborate, rather prolonged liturgical service found in the Roman Catholic 
  Church. It was a simple meal that the Jews had been having on Passover for 
  hundreds of years, though to be sure, the symbolism of the unleavened Passover 
  meal was indeed important, as it represented the sinless Messiah, the Lamb of 
  God who would be crucified on 14 Nisan. </p>
  <p>The breaking of bread at Emmaus simply does not indicate a liturgical 
  worship service involving Communion, though quite clearly, there was something 
  in the manner in which Christ broke the bread that was unique, and which 
  instantly revealed His identity. No doubt having been with Christ so recently 
  when he broke bread for the Passover meal of 14 Nisan (the previous Thursday 
  evening), helped to jog their memory on that Sunday afternoon after the 
  resurrection, but no religious worship service is indicated.</p>
  <div align="center">

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFDFD5">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">Thus there is good evidence to suggest that when St. 
        Paul met with the believers in Acts 20, &quot;on the first day of the week,&quot; 
        to preach to them and &quot;to break bread,&quot; it was in the context of a 
        worship service.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Does the text anywhere declare that the reason for the presumed service 
  that Sunday was in order to honor or celebrate the resurrection? No. Also, 
  does that passage (Acts 20:7) anywhere declare that the previous Saturday 
  Sabbath had NOT been observed because Sunday had superceded it? No, in fact 
  the reason is given for the gathering, that being that Paul was departing in 
  the morning at the conclusion of the meeting, so this was the last chance of a 
  meeting. There is simply no evidence in Acts 20 that Sunday had been 
  instituted as the weekly worship day replacing the Saturday Sabbath.</p>
  <p><u><b>Communion Recalls Christ's Death, not His Resurrection:</b></u></p>
  <p>Significantly, the apostle Paul in scripture declares that the Lord's 
  Supper (the emblems of Christ's body and blood) is a remembrance of Christ's
  <u>death</u>, <b><i>not</i></b> His resurrection:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do 
    show the Lord's death till he come.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, if it were to be linked with a week day by the disciples, the Lord's 
  supper would have been logically associated with Friday and the crucifixion, 
  not Sunday and the resurrection. (Christ and the apostles participated in the 
  Passover after sundown on what we now call Thursday evening, but according to 
  the Bible the day begins and ends at sundown, so it was actually on Friday.)</p>
  <p><u><b>Baptism Recalls Christ's Resurrection:</b></u></p>
  <p>Also, it is worth noting that according to the apostle Paul, the New 
  Testament ordinance that remembers the resurrection is actually baptism, <i>
  <b>not</b></i> communion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like 
    as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we 
    also should walk in newness of life.<br>
    Rom 6:5 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, 
    we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>
  </blockquote>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFDFD5">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">This is further established when we read St. Paul's 
        directives on taking up the tithes in the church:
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the 
          churches of Galatia, so do you also. On the first day of every week 
          let each one of you put aside and save, as he may prosper, that no 
          collections be made when I come.&quot; (1 Cor. 16:1-2) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now, why would St. Paul direct both the Corinthian church and the 
        &quot;churches of Galatia&quot; to collect their tithes &quot;on the first day of every 
        week?&quot; The only plausible reason is that the believers were already 
        congregating together on that day. It would make no sense, if they were 
        in the habit of worshiping together on the seventh day, the Saturday, to 
        wait until the next day to make the collection. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>But Paul does NOT direct the churches to collect money on the first day of 
  the week. He says that at the beginning of the week, everyone is to set aside 
  (at home) a portion of their income for the church (saints) at Jerusalem (v. 
  3). In that way the money will already be set aside and readily available when 
  he arrives. No Sunday church service or gathering is indicated on Sundays in 
  that passage, and it simply does <u>not</u> refer to collecting the tithe or 
  passing the plate in church on Sundays.</p>

  <p>Yes, it is true. Jesus Himself confirms that the 10 Commandments of God 
  remain in effect even until heaven and earth pass away:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 5:18 <font color="#FF0000">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and 
    earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till 
    all be fulfilled.</font><br>
    Mat 5:19 <font color="#FF0000">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these 
    least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in 
    the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall 
    be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those who say the 7th day Saturday Sabbath Commandment (Exo. 20:8-11) has 
  been revoked, rescinded, done away with, or replaced by Sunday, and need no 
  longer be remembered or observed, are in direct contradiction to this passage. 
  Those who say the Sabbath has passed away are teaching men to BREAK a 
  commandment of God, and they will be <i>denounced</i> in heaven.</p>

        teach that the Sabbath was a temporary ordinance, a shadow that only 
        pointed forward to the reality of Christ. Hear St. Paul again, speaking 
        of Old Covenant Judaic laws:
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Therefore let no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink

        </blockquote>
        <p>The temporal nature of the seventh-day commandment is made clear 
        here, for St. Paul insists that no one could rightly judge the Christian 
        for not observing the Jewish festivals, new moons, or Sabbath days. And 
        why? Because these things are &quot;a mere shadow,&quot; the fulfillment of which

  <p>The seventh day Saturday Sabbath is specifically said in the Commandment to 
  be a memorial to creation (Exo. 20:11). The ceremonial sabbaths associated 
  with the yearly Sanctuary festivals were, on the other hand, shadows or 
  prophetic in nature, of events in the plan of salvation that had future 
  fulfillments. Passover was a shadow of the crucifixion, Pentecost was 
  prophetic of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the early church, etc. The 
  seventh day Saturday Sabbath was first kept at the end of creation week, and 
  was inscribed by the hand of God in the stones of God's Law the 10 
  Commandments and so is separate and distinct from the yearly festival Sabbaths 
  that began with Israel's release from Egypt on the first Passover, and were a 
  part of the Mosaic ceremonial law.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And it came about that He was passing through the grainfields on 
          the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while 
          picking the heads of grain. And the Pharisees were saying to Him, &quot;See 
          here, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&quot;... And He 
          was saying to them, &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the

        </blockquote>
        <p>In this narrative we read of only one of many occasions on which 
        Jesus was accused of breaking the Sabbath. St. John's gospel, chapters 
        5, 7, and 9 record more instances where the Jews were violently angry 
        with Our Lord for violating the written code of the Sabbath. Jesus' 
        response to these accusations is authoritative: &quot;The Son of Man is Lord 
        even of the Sabbath.&quot; Jesus could alter the regulations of the written 
        code when He chose to honor the spirit of the Law, and not just the 
        letter. If He could fulfill the Sabbath Law by breaking the commandment 
        against doing work on the Sabbath, then certainly St. Paul is on the 
        right path to say that the very observance of the seventh-day Sabbath is 
        subject to greater fulfillment in Christ. And how is the Sabbath 
        fulfilled in Christ? By worshiping Him on the day on which He won our 
        salvation: &quot;He... was raised for our justification.&quot; (Rom. 4:25) </td>

  <p>While Jesus was certainly accused of breaking the Sabbath by His enemies, 
  He never did any such thing. Jesus was healing and doing good in the name of 
  the Father, and the spiritually blind Pharisee's accused Him of breaking the 
  Sabbath laws. But Jesus was not breaking His Father's laws, he was breaking 
  the traditions and rules of the Pharisees, rules and traditions which God had 
  never imposed, which made the Sabbath a burden rather than a joy. Anyone who 
  suggests that Jesus went about breaking the Sabbath of God, for any reason at 
  all, does not know God, and places himself in the company of the spiritually 
  blind Pharisees.</p>

  <p>Both Lam. 2:6 and Hos. 2:11 are foretelling the punishment of an apostate

  That punishment was that their nation would fall, they would be taken in 
  bondage to Babylon, and Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem would be destroyed, 
  which happened in 586 B.C.. One of the sins of the Northern kingdom of Israel, 
  interestingly enough, was the establishment of counterfeit rival festivals 
  that imitated God's festivals (see 1 Kings 12:32).</p>
  <p>God was surely not intending to totally abolish His sabbaths in those 
  verses, and neither do those verses foretell a fading away of the Old Covenant 
  as claimed, because the second temple was later rebuilt (after 70 years of 
  captivity) by Zerubbabel, and the repentant Jews again celebrated the 
  festivals and the associated sabbaths (see Ezr 3:8 to 4:5; and 4:24; to 6:22)

  <p>The assertions and interpretations presented to this point in support of

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">The $64,000 question is this: <em>which day is the 
        seventh day</em>?
        <p>One would have to assert that, since it was the seventh day <i>of 
        creation</i> that God &quot;blessed&quot; and &quot;sanctified&quot; (Gen. 2:2-3), that it 
        must be this day which we continue to hallow. It must be the seventh 
        day, counting from the first day of creation. That is, after all, what 
        God demanded in Sacred Scripture. </p>
        <p>However, there is a small problem: by the time of the 1st century AD, 
        there were two different calendars in use by the Jews, and a bit of an 
        ongoing argument as to which calendar was the authentic calendar. </p>
        <p>Consider these two seemingly contradictory statements: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And it came about that when Jesus had finished all these words, He 
          said to His disciples, &quot;You know that after two days the Passover is 
          coming and the Son of Man is to be delivered up for crucifixion.&quot;... 
          Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the leper, a woman 
          came to Him with an alabaster vial of very costly perfume, and she 
          poured it upon His head as He reclined at the table.&quot; (Mt. 26:1-2, 
          6-7) </p>
          <p>&quot;Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany 
          where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. So they made 
          Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of 
          those reclining at the table with Him. Mary therefore took a pound of 
          very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and 
          wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the 
          fragrance of the perfume.&quot; (John 12:1-3) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>How can both of these stories be true? St. Matthew says that Jesus 
        was anointed two days before Passover, while St. John says it was six 
        days before Passover. </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Yes, both stories are absolutely true, but there is <u>no</u> discrepancy 
  when properly understood. John clearly states that Jesus entered Bethany six 
  days before Passover, and Matthew 26:6 is indeed referring to the same event 
  on the same day, and that is the meaning of &quot;Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in 
  the house of Simon the leper&quot;. You see, Matthew was not giving a narrative in 
  strict chronological sequence. The mistake is in assuming that Matt. 26:6-13 
  necessarily occurred <i>after</i> Matt. 26:2. It is an unwarranted assumption, 
  and without it the alleged discrepancy in days completely disappears. In other 
  words, read Matt. 26:6 this way: &quot;Now when Jesus was in Bethany (six days 
  before Passover), in the house of Simon the leper,&quot; and then Matthew agrees 
  completely with John.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">The discrepancy is shown in another place as well:
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to 
          Jesus, saying, &quot;Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the 
          Passover?&quot; And He said, &quot;Go into the city to a certain man, and say to 
          him, `The Teacher says, &quot;My time is at hand; I am to keep the Passover 
          at your house with My disciples.&quot;'&quot; And the disciples did as Jesus had 
          directed them; and they prepared the Passover.&quot; (Mt. 26:17-19) </p>
          <p>&quot;Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about 
          the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, &quot;Behold, your King!&quot; They 
          therefore cried out, &quot;Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!&quot; 
          Pilate said to them, &quot;Shall I crucify your King?&quot; The chief priests 
          answered, &quot;We have no king but Caesar.&quot; So he then delivered Him to 
          them to be crucified.&quot; (John 19:14-16) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>St. Matthew has Jesus and His disciples celebrating the Last Supper 
        on the Passover, at least a day (I will argue more than a day) before He 
        was crucified. But St. John says that the priests of the Jerusalem 
        temple were still in preparation for the Passover on the day Our Lord 
        was crucified. Which one is it? </p>
        <p>Some fairly recent studies by historians has shed light on the 
        situation. For Jesus and His disciples celebrated Passover in the Upper 
        Room of a house located in territory heavily populated with Essenes. The 
        Essenes were Jewish purists, and they followed the old Solar calendar of 
        the forefathers, which meant that, in that particular year, the Passover 
        fell on a Tuesday. The pharisees in Jerusalem, however, had adopted the 
        &quot;politically correct&quot; Lunar calendar, which placed Passover that year on 
        Friday. Thus, when Jesus was anointed on the Sunday before His death, 
        St. Matthew says it was two days before Passover, while St. John says it 
        was six days before Passover. Why would St. John side with the priests? 
        Scripture gives a hint: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;And Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple. 
          Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with Jesus 
          into the court of the high priest, but Peter was standing at the door 
          outside. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went 
          out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought in Peter.&quot; (John 
          18:15-16) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now, we know that the only other disciple at the Crucifixion was St. 
        John, who stood at the foot of the cross. Thus we know that he is the 
        one spoken of in the above passage, which says that he was able to get 
        St. Peter into the courtyard because he &quot;was known to the high priest.&quot; 
        Evidently, for some reason, perhaps through family connections, St. John 
        knew the high priest, and was able to get a &quot;back stage pass&quot; to the 
        proceedings. If St. John was more familiar with the ways of the 
        Jerusalem priests, then it makes sense that he would adopt their 
        calendar, and place Passover on a Friday. </p>
        <p>This actually explains how it is that Jesus could celebrate Passover 
        in the evening, be out in the Garden in the middle of night praying, be 
        arrested that same night, appear before the high priest for a lengthy 
        trial, appear before Pilate for a trial, appear before Herod for a 
        hearing, return back to Pilate for sentencing, and be crucified around 
        the sixth hour on Friday - which would be nearly impossible if He was 
        celebrating Passover only the night before.</p>
        <p>So what does all of that have to do with the Seventh Day Adventist 
        position? Much! Consider this Law of God regarding the Passover: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&quot;In the first month, on the <em>fourteenth day</em> of the month at 
          twilight is the LORD'S Passover.&quot; (Lev. 23:5) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>God attached the observance of the Passover to the &quot;fourteenth day,&quot; 
        much like He attached the observance of the Sabbath to the &quot;seventh 
        day.&quot; However, as we have just seen in the two gospel accounts, there 
        was a disagreement amongst the Jews as to which day was really the 
        fourteenth day. According to the Solar calendar, the fourteenth day was 
        on Tuesday, but according to the Lunar calendar, the fourteenth day was 
        on Friday. Thus there were two Passover celebrations surrounding Jesus' 
        crucifixion, one in the Essene quarters, and one in the Jerusalem 
        temple. Which one was really the fourteenth day? Who knows? And if the 
        fourteenth day was under dispute in the 1st century AD, then it 
        logically follows that the seventh day was also under dispute. Which 
        group (the Essenes or the Pharisees) were correct? </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>The above is total and utter nonsense. The timing of Passover has no 
  relevance what-so-ever to any alleged uncertainty regarding the true Sabbath 
  day. God <u>never</u> used a solar calendar to set His festivals, and to 
  suggest that Jesus was influenced by the Essenes to use a solar calendar, and 
  that Passover was on a Tuesday as a result, is nothing but pure nonsense. </p>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">God's Lunar Calendar</font></b></u></p>
  <p>God had set in the sky the master clock of His calendar (Gen. 1:14). The 
  observance of the New Moon (the first day the crescent is seen after the 
  astronomical new/dark moon) marked the day that began a month [moonth]. This 
  is a lunar calendar, and contrary to the assertion made above, it was not a 
  &quot;politically correct&quot; corruption of the Pharisees, rather the lunar calendar 
  was, and is, in fact, God's biblically correct calendar. </p>
  <p>Passover, as cited above, is the fourteenth day of the first month of the 
  year. This would by definition, coincide with the full moon, since the lunar 
  cycle is about 29 days. Because the lunar calendar of 12 months does not match 
  the length of the solar year, a correction of some sort is obviously required 
  to keep festivals in the proper season.</p>
  <p>The way God's lunar calendar was corrected to keep in synchronization with 
  the seasons was by using a leap month, which was added, or not added, based on 
  the readiness for harvest of the barley crop in the Spring. When the New Moon 
  was sighted that would begin the first month (Nisan), the barley in the fields 
  was checked for ripeness. If it was determined that the barley would not be 
  ripe for harvest in 16 days (on 16 Nisan - firstfruits, see Lev. 23:10-11), 
  then a leap month (II Adar) was added, delaying Nisan and the new year and its 
  sequence of festivals for one month (Passover is the first festival of the 
  year, and Tabernacles is the last festival of the biblical year).</p>
  <p>See: <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><b>
  <a href="feasts.html">The Biblical Feast Days - God's Calendar.</a></b></p>
  <p>So the determining factor in God's master lunar calendar was the 
  coincidence of a Spring New Moon and the readiness of the barley crop for 
  harvest (sixteen days later) on 16 Nisan. When that happened, the beginning of 
  a new year and month of Nisan was declared by the priesthood. No alleged solar 
  calendar has any effect of any kind on this calculation, and the whole matter 
  has no bearing at all on determining the true seventh day Sabbath, the keeping 
  of which is completely independent of any yearly or monthly calendar 
  calculations, which should be self-evident in even a superficial review of the 
  facts. But, as we shall see, some Sunday keepers will persist in claiming that 
  the Sabbath has been lost in calendar changes.</p>

        <td width="100%">As we move further into history, we discover that by 
        the time of Julius Caesar, the Lunar calendar was grossly out of sync 
        with the Solar calendar. Major adjustments and modifications had to be 
        made to keep the two in harmony, because in only a matter of three 
        years, the Lunar and Solar calendars would be more than a month apart. 
        In all of these adjustments, is it possible that the seventh day (the 
        true seventh day, the seventh day from the first day of Creation) was 
        preserved?
        <p>The calendar was a tough thing to maintain, let's face it. The 
        heavenly bodies do not complete their rotations in <em>exact</em> units 
        of measurement, like 24 hours, 30 days, 31 days, 365 days, etc. In fact, 
        the Lunar calendar is really only 354 days long, which puts it eleven or 
        so days behind the Solar calendar. And the length of a day is mere 
        minutes short of an exact 24-hour period. By the late 1500s, these 
        fractional differences had added up, and the Julian calendar was off by 
        - get this - <i>twelve days</i>. </p>
        <p>It was Pope Gregory XII who commissioned a group of astronomers to 
        help him fix the calendar once and for all. It was developed as a 
        self-correcting calendar, which makes use of this funny little device 
        called a leap year, a once-every-four-years event that sets the calendar 
        back on track, but which actually puts us one day behind the &quot;regular&quot; 
        calendar. That is, on that fourth year, when we observe the 29th of 
        February, it is actually the 1st of March, which makes the 1st of March 
        really the 2nd of March, the 2nd really the 3rd, and so on, until the 
        next leap year, when the 1st of March is actually the 3rd of March, the 
        2nd the 4th, and so on. </p>
        <p>And whatever happened to those 12 lost days from the Julian calendar, 
        when the Gregorian calendar was implemented? Did they disappear? Were 
        they factored in? Did the calendar suddenly skip from September 14th 
        back to September 2nd, or leap forward to September 26th? </p>
        <p>The problem should be obvious. The Seventh Day Adventist, who insists 
        that the literal seventh day <i>must</i> be observed as a holy day, has 
        no way of knowing whether or not he is truly hallowing the actual 
        seventh day. In all of that calendar juggling, it could be that the 
        &quot;seventh day&quot; of the Gregorian calendar, on which the Adventist observes 
        the Sabbath, is actually the fourth day according the original Creation 
        calendar. </td>

  <p>If we assume for a moment that this reasoning is correct, and Saturday, the 
  7th day of the week was indeed lost in the Roman Catholic Gregorian calendar 
  change, then have we not by the exact same calendar change also totally and 
  completely lost Sunday, the first day of the week? <i>The Catholics lost 
  Sunday</i>? If true, then why does the Roman Catholic Church insist, on pain 
  of committing a grave sin, that all Catholics assist at the Mass on a 
  particular day of the week that supposedly coincides with the day of the 
  resurrection 2000 years ago? How can Saturday be lost, but Sunday be certain? 
  Either they are both lost, or they are both certain. So which is it? Has the 
  Catholic Church faithfully kept Sundays (the 1st day) since the crucifixion, 
  in the process also never losing the Saturday Sabbath (7th day), or have both 
  days been lost forever? The two positions are obviously mutually exclusive. 
  See: <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><b>
  <a href="notsun.html">Sunday is NOT the biblical Sabbath day</a> </b>regarding 
  the Gregorian calendar change.</p>
  <p>Well briefly, the Roman Catholic Church has NEVER believed or officially 
  taught, for even a moment, that Sunday has been lost in any calendar change. 
  They have, however, taught that the Apostles instituted the change to Sunday 
  and that the Christian Church has kept it faithfully and regularly ever since 
  in honor of the resurrection.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <h3>The day of the Resurrection: the new creation </h3>
    <p><b>2174</b> Jesus rose from the dead &quot;on the first day of the week.&quot;[104] 
    Because it is the &quot;first day,&quot; the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the 
    first creation. Because it is the &quot;eighth day&quot; following the sabbath,[105] 
    it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For 
    Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the 
    Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday: We all gather on the 
    day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also 
    the first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; 
    and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead.[106] </p>
    <h3>Sunday- fulfillment of the sabbath</h3>
    <p><b>2175</b> Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it 
    follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial observance 
    replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday fulfills the 
    spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's eternal rest in 
    God. ...</p>
    <p><b>2178</b> <u>This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the 
    beginnings of the apostolic age</u>. [112]</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><strong style="font-weight: 400">So clearly, the official position of the 
  Roman Catholic Church is that today's Sunday is the same day of the week as 
  2000 years ago, and by assisting in the Mass on Sunday, the Catholic is 
  honoring the resurrection on the same day on which it occurred. They also, at 
  the same time, freely confess that the 7th day Sabbath has not been lost, 
  since it immediately precedes Sunday. </strong></p>
  <p>As a practicing Catholic, Jacob Michael is strictly forbidden, by the 
  councils of Trent and Vatican I, to teach anything contrary to the teaching of 
  the Roman Catholic Church, and Magisterial teaching has <u><i>never</i></u> 
  taught that calendar changes have lost either Saturday or Sunday. On the 
  contrary, the Church has consistently taught that Sunday was, and is, the day 
  of the resurrection, and on that basis commands and binds all Catholics to 
  attend and participate in Mass on Sunday.</p>
  <p><strong style="font-weight: 400">Now, even Jacob Michael maintained in the 
  beginning of his argument that &quot;breaking bread&quot; in Acts 2:42 had a liturgical 
  significance, and he asserts that Paul was directing a Sunday tithe collection 
  during Sunday services in Corinth, and he even tried to persuade us that as 
  early as the Sunday of the resurrection Jesus had a Eucharistic Mass in 
  Emmaus! So, it should be quite clear that all this calendar confusion nonsense 
  is nothing but smoke and mirrors, and is not representative of either official 
  Catholic teaching, or the facts. </strong></p>

        <td width="100%">What is stranger, perhaps, is that the Adventist, who 
        accuses Catholics and non-Adventist Protestants of following the &quot;papal 
        Sabbath,&quot; is himself following a papal calendar. Unless the Adventist 
        can somehow get back to celebrating the Julian calendar, or the Jewish 
        Solar calendar, he is subject to a calendar designed and instituted by 
        Pope Gregory XIII - the antiChrist?<p>The only escape for the Adventist 
        at this point is to concede that it is the spirit of the Law that is 
        important here, and not the letter of the Law. In other words, since no 
        one can ever know with certainty which day of the week is the <i>real</i> 
        Seventh Day (counting from the first day of Creation), he must fall back 
        on the old principle, &quot;It's the thought that counts.&quot; </p>
        <p>And that is exactly my point, as a Roman Catholic who worships the 
        Lord on the &quot;day&quot; of His resurrection. Because it's the spirit of the 
        Law that is important. And on the Lord's Day, Sunday, the Day of the Sun 
        in pagan times, we worship the true Sun: &quot;the Sun of Justice,&quot; as 
        Malachi 4:2 puts it. Following St. Paul's advice, we allow no one to 
        judge us by our observance of the Jewish Sabbath. </td>

  <p>Adventists need no &quot;escape&quot;. The Saturday Sabbath was not affected in the 
  slightest by the Gregorian calendar change, and no solar calendar had any 
  effect either. The Jews have kept the Sabbath every Saturday for thousands of 
  years, without regard for secular calendar changes, and the Jew and Adventist 
  alike are quite sure the day has not been lost at any time in history. Again, 
  see: <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"><b>
  <a href="notsun.html">Sunday is NOT the biblical Sabbath day</a></b> for 
  details regarding the Gregorian calendar change.</p>
  <p>Note that the assertion is made above that Sunday is the same day as in 
  pagan times!? I have to laugh that at the same time someone can seriously 
  contend that the Saturday Sabbath has been lost to us in calendar changes:</p>

        <td width="100%">The calendar trudges on, shifting days and months by 
        fractional margins every single hour, but this is of little consequence

  </div>
  <p>So, to go back to the two questions asked by Jacob Michael in the beginning 
  - </p>
  <p><b>Question:</b> Which day of the week is the proper day for worshiping 
  God? Is it Saturday? Sunday? </p>
  <p><b>Answer:</b> The seventh day Saturday Sabbath was not rescinded in the 
  New Testament by either God or the Apostles, and neither was it replaced by 
  Sunday by a declaration of God, or the Apostles.</p>
  <p><b>Question:</b> Does it even matter?</p>
  <p><b>Answer:</b> To God, yes, it is one of His Ten Commandments, none of 
  which will pass away even until heaven and earth pass away (Matt. 5:18-19). 
  Therefore it should matter to all professing Christians.</p>
  <p>So as previously pointed out, Daniel 7:25 predicted that the antichrist 
  little horn power would think to change the times and laws of the most high 
  God, and the Sabbath commandment of Exodus 20:8-11 is the only precept of 
  God's Law, the 10 Commandments, dealing with time. The Roman Catholic Church, 
  fulfilling the prophecy, stands up and officially proclaims they have changed 
  this precept of God, and transferred the Saturday Sabbath to Sunday:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 383] The Apostles therefore resolved to consecrate the first day of 
    the week to the divine worship, and called it the Lord's day. St. John in 
    the Apocalypse makes mention of the Lord's day; and the Apostle commands 
    collections to be made on the first day of the week, that is, according to 
    the interpretation of St. Chrysostom, on the Lord's day. From all this we 
    learn that even then the Lord's day was kept holy in the Church.</p>
    <p>[pg. 387] But the Church of God has in her wisdom ordained that the 
    celebration of the Sabbath should be transferred to &quot;the Lord's day:&quot; as on 
    that day light first shown on the world, so by the resurrection of our Lord 
    on the same day, by whom was thrown open to us the gate to eternal life, we 
    were called out of darkness into light; and hence the Apostle would have it 
    called &quot;the Lord's day.&quot; We also learn from the sacred Volume that the first 
    day of the week was held sacred for other reasons: on that day the work of 
    the creation commenced, and on that day the Holy Ghost descended upon the 
    Apostles [Pentecost].</p>
