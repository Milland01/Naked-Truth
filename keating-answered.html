  An Answer To Karl Keating.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>If you are on the email list for <a href="http://www.catholic.com/">Catholic Answers</a>, then 
  in December of 2009 you have received 
  a fundraising email from Karl Keating, several times, that included the following rather remarkable excerpt:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="90%" cellpadding="12">
      <tr>
        <td width="100%" bgcolor="#FFDFDF">
        <p align="center"><font size="4"><em>From the desk of </em><br>
        </font><strong><font size="4">Karl Keating</font><br>
        <br>
        <font size="6">The Heart and Soul <br>
        of Catholic Answers</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">...</strong></p>
        <p>As you and I know, only the Catholic Church possesses the <u>fullness 
        of truth</u> as revealed by God. Other faith communities have <u>some</u> 
        of the truth. And some have more than others.<br>
        <br>
        But when it comes to having <em>everything</em> that God has revealed to 
        man—and <u>how</u> he wants man to worship him—<em>only</em> the 
        Catholic Church can make that claim.<br>
        <br>
        That’s not arrogance. It’s what marketing experts call the “unique 
        selling proposition.”<br>
        <br>
        In other words, it’s what distinguishes the Catholic Church from the 
        “competition,” so to speak.<br>
        <br>
        Protestant denominations, by contrast, usually don’t make <em>any</em> 
        claims about their superiority to one another. They take a very weak “me 
        too” position and tell people that <em>it really doesn’t matter</em> 
        what church or denomination you belong to. As long as you’re happy, 
        that’s all that matters.</p>
        <div align="center">
          <font size="5"><strong>Not True</strong></font></div>
        <p>The fact is that, for anyone who wants to follow Christ <strong>fully</strong> 
        and keep his commandments exactly as he instructed us, the Catholic 
        Church <u>is</u> the answer.<br>
        <br>
        The <em>only</em> answer.</p>
        <p>...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Now that's a claim that demands a response. The 10 
  Commandments clearly specify the seventh day (Saturday) be kept as the sabbath, the 
  day of rest, yet it is not the seventh day Catholics observe, but the first day 
  (Sunday). There is not even a single verse in the Bible that instructs Sunday 
  is to be kept holy on a weekly basis:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;... is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday and to abstain on 
    that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of this law 
    among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But, you may read the Bible 
    from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a single line authorizing 
    the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures enforce the religious 
    observance of Saturday, a day which we never sanctify.&quot;</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>2175</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which 
    it follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial 
    observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday 
    fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's 
    eternal rest in God. For worship under the Law prepared for the mystery of 
    Christ, and what was done there prefigured some aspects of Christ:<sup>107</sup> 
    Those who lived according to the old order of things have come to a new 
    hope, no longer keeping the sabbath, but the Lord's Day, in which our life 
    is blessed by him and by his death.<sup>108</sup> <br>
    ...<br>
    <strong>2177&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The Sunday 
    celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the 
    Church's life. &quot;Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated 
    in light of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost 
    holy day of obligation in the universal Church.&quot;<sup>110</sup></strong></p>

  <p>How then can Mr. Keating's claim be true? It can't be. The Roman Catholic 
  Church does
  <i>not</i> keep the commandments exactly as instructed by Christ, and neither 
  do they &quot;possess the fullness of truth&quot; if they claim to have replaced the 
  biblical seventh day sabbath, Saturday, with Sunday, the first day of the 
  week. </p>
  <p>The true church will:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
  Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
  Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
  shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
  nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
  gates:<br>
  Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
  that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the 
  sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As Christ said:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>John 14:15 <font color="#FF0000">If ye love me, keep my commandments.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This the Catholic Church does NOT do. On Sunday they are actually keeping a 
  Tradition of men, laying aside the Commandment of God. That's rebellion, not obedience.</p>

    <p>
    Then there is this Commandment that defines and prohibits idolatry:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
    Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
    any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that 
    is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
    LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
    children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;<br>
    Exo 20:6 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that <u>love me, and keep 
    my commandments.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">
    Note that John 14:15 is essentially a quote of Exodus 20:6. This commandment 
    Catholics are also taught to routinely 
    violate. <br>
    See:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left">
    <b>
    <img src="star.gif" border="0" width="16" height="12"> </b>
    <font face="Arial"><em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: 700">
    <a href="index_6.html">Catholicism's Graven Images</a></em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">
    So, no, the Catholic Church does not &quot;follow Christ 
    <strong style="font-weight: 400">fully</strong> and keep his commandments 
    exactly as he instructed&quot;, they are not even close.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p align="left">
    1 John 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his 
    commandments.<br>
    1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a 
    liar, and the truth is not in him.<br>
    1 John 2:5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God 
    perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.<br>
    1 John 2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, 
    even as he walked.</p>
