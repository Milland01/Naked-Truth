Resign<br>
Due To Doctrinal Repression By A Roman Catholic Superior</strong></font></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">The <em>Washington Times</em> is reporting that an
  evangelical U.S. Navy chaplain serving in Italy was forced to resign from the
  Navy due to a doctrinal dispute with his Roman Catholic superior. Lieutenant
  Commander Philip Veitch, ordained by the Reformed Episcopal Church, had
  preached the following in one of his sermons:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;No saint, no minister, no priest, no person ordained
    or unordained -- no one stands between us and God, but Christ Jesus. Christ
    Jesus, in the Holy of Holies, is the meeting point between the sinner and
    the triune God.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">According to Veitch, his superior, Roman Catholic chaplain
  Ronald Buchmiller, was upset at his sermons because they were allegedly &quot;unpluralistic&quot;
  and &quot;anti-priest.&quot; What that means is that his preaching was
  directly opposed to Roman Catholic theology, which requires a priest be of
  valid apostolic succession for absolution of sin. Protestants teach that
  forgiveness can be obtained directly from Jesus Christ, our true High Priest
  (Heb. 9:11). The Bible also makes clear that there is only one mediator
  between God and man:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
    man Christ Jesus;<br>
    1 Tim 2:6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.<br>
    1 Tim 2:7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the
    truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
    verity.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">As a result of his preaching fundamental Bible-based truths,
  Lieutenant Commander Veitch was charged by the Navy with &quot;disdain,
  insolence, and contempt&quot; towards his senior officer, but according to
  Veitch, the threatened court-martial proceedings against him would be dropped
  if he agreed to resign, which he did. He has now reconsidered his resignation
  and is attempting to withdraw it, saying &quot;I will not have a Roman
  Catholic priest tell me what I can and cannot say.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Another&nbsp;former Navy chaplain, who had also been
  stationed in Italy at the same command, said he had been ordered to stop
  ending his prayers with the phrase &quot;In Jesus' name.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">This kind of doctrinal censorship has no place in the
  chaplaincy of the U.S. military. Not only should Lieutenant Commander Philip
  Veitch be reinstated without prejudice, but his former superior, Roman
  Catholic chaplain Ronald Buchmiller, should be sternly disciplined, and
  permanently removed from <em>any</em> position of authority over non-Catholic
  ministers. <strong>No military chaplain should be subject to any doctrinal
  review or censorship by superiors from another denomination.</strong></font></p>
