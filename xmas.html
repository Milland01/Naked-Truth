<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;If you can't believe that he [Jesus] was born on December 25th, then
  you can't believe anything else in the Bible!&quot;, or so stated a woman
  quoted in the <em>Practice of Ministry in Canada</em> article <em>Enshrining Ignorance<b> </b></em>by
  Jim Taylor. Is December 25th the true date of Christ's birth? How did
  celebrating that date come
  about?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 2:8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
    field, keeping watch over their flock by night.<br>
    Luke 2:9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the
    Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.<br>
    Luke 2:10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
    good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.<br>
    Luke 2:11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
    which is Christ the Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the shepherds were watching over their flocks in the field at night.
  Have you ever thought that it may have been a little cold on a late December
  night in Bethlehem? Well the Bible says nothing about the birth of Jesus being
  at that time of year. Indeed, if the flocks were still in the field, it
  definitely was not during the winter. Since the Bible does not openly declare
  any particular date for the birth of Jesus Christ, just how is it that
  December 25 was selected?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>III. The feast of the Epiphany, which had existed fairly generally in the
    Greek Church even in the third century, is now found in the Latin Church
    also. In migrating, the feast acquired, however, a new meaning. Whilst in
    the East it commemorated more especially Christ's Baptism, in the West it
    came to be a festival in honour of His manifestation to the Gentiles. The
    other meanings of the feast gradually passed into the background, one of
    them, that of Christ's birth, becoming the object of an entirely new
    festival, Christmas. The origin of the latter is by no means clear: the
    Armenian Ananias the 'Computer,' writing at the beginning of the seventh
    century, tells us that it was kept at the imperial court under Constantius
    (337-61); we have also an illusion of the so-called Chronographer of A.D.
    354. If his notice at the head of the <em>Depositio Martyrum</em> is to be
    taken as indicating that December 25 was merely reckoned as Christ's
    birthday, then the feast may have arisen subsequently to 354, but if it
    refers, as quite possibly it may, to a festival, then Christmas must have
    been kept as a feast not only in 354, but, as is clear from a comparison
    with the Chronographer's <em>Depositio Episcoporum</em>, as far back as 336.
    However this may be, the feast certainly existed in Rome before 360, and
    from thence it spread throughout the Church; Justin I [p. 199] (518-27) was,
    nevertheless, obliged to issue decrees making its observation compulsory
    throughout the empire. Armenia alone refused to accept it, and there
    Christ's birth is still commemorated on the Epiphany. December 25 seems to
    have been chosen on account of the Roman custom of keeping this day as the
    festival of Sol Invictus - i.e. of the re-birth of the sun; it was judged
    fitting to substitute for the pagan feast a Christian one commemorating the
    birth of the true Sun of the world and Redeemer of mankind.</p>

  <p>The twelve days of Christmas are the twelve days counted from December 25th
  to January 5, January 6th being the date the Epiphany (Twelfth Night) is
  celebrated, which is when the three Wise Men, or Magi, visited Bethlehem.</p>

  <p><b>Date of Christ's birth uncertain in the 3rd Century.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p. 249] Uncertainty about Jesus’ birthday in the early third century
    is reflected in a disputed passage of the presbyter Hippolytus, who was
    banished to Sardinia by Maximin in 235, and in an authentic statement of
    Clement of Alexandria. While the former favored January second, the learned
    Clem- [p. 250] ent of Alexandria enumerates several dates given by the
    Alexandrian chronographers, notably the twenty-fifth of the Egyptian month
    Pachon (May twentieth) in the twenty-eighth year of Augustus and the
    twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of Pharmuthi (April eighteenth or nineteenth)
    of the year A.D. 1, although he favored May twentieth. This shows that no
    Church festival in honor of the day was established before the middle of the
    third century. Origen at that time in a sermon denounced the idea of keeping
    Jesus’ birthday like that of Pharaoh and said that only sinners such as
    Herod were so honored. Arnobius later similarly ridiculed giving birthdays
    to “gods.” A Latin treatise, <em>De pascha computus</em> (of ca. 243),
    placed Jesus’ birth on March twenty-first since that was the supposed day
    on which God created the Sun (Gen. 1:14–19), thus typifying the “Sun of
    righteousness” as Malachi (4:2) called the expected Messiah. A century
    before Polycarp, martyred in Smyrna in 155, gave the same date for the birth
    and baptism placing it on a Wednesday because of the creation of the Sun on
    that day.</p>

    the month or the day of the event… There is no historical evidence that
    our Lord’s birthday was celebrated during the apostolic or early
    postapostolic times. The uncertainty that existed at the beginning of the
    third century in the minds of Hippolytus and others—Hippolytus earlier
    favored Jan. 2, Clement of Alexanderia (Strom., i. 21) “the 25th day of
    Pachon” (= May 20), while others, according to Clement, fixed upon Apr. 18
    or 19 and Mar. 28—proves that no Christmas festival had been established
    much before the middle of the century. Jan. 6 was earlier fixed upon as the
    date of the baptism or spiritual birth of Christ, and the feast of Epiphany
    … was celebrated by the Basilidian Gnostics in the second century … and
    by catholic Christians by about the beginning of the fourth century. The
    earliest record of the recognition of Dec. 25 as a church festival is in the
    Philocalian Calendar (copied 354 but representing Roman practise in 336).</p>

  <p><b>December 25th instituted as a Christian holy day</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A star cult, sun-worship, became (in the third century A.D.) the dominant
    official creed, paving the road for the ultimate triumph of Judaeo-Christian
    monotheism. So strong was the belief in the Invincible Sun (Sol Invictus)
    that for example Constantine I (d. 337), himself at first a devotee of the
    sun cult, found it, indeed perfectly compatible with his pro-Christian
    sympathies to authorize his own portrayal as Helios. And in 354 the
    ascendant Christian church in the reign of his pious but unsavory son,
    Constantius II, found it prudent to change the celebration of the birth of
    Jesus from the traditional date (January 6) to December 25, in order to
    combat the pagan Sun god’s popularity—his “birthday” being December
    25.</p>

  <p><b>Why is Christmas celebrated on December 25th?</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Although Christmas is celebrated on the 25th day of December each year,
    the exact date of Jesus' birth is unknown. Most biblical scholars agree that
    the birth, in fact, did not take place in December at all, but probably
    occurred during the spring of the year. The Gospel of Luke states that the
    shepherds to whom the announcement of the birth was made were watching
    theirs sheep by night (Luke 2:8) which would suggest the lambing time (the
    spring). Only then did shepherds bother to guard their flocks around the [p.
    206] clock. In winter, for example, the sheep would have been kept in the
    corral.</p>
    <p>Why, then, the 25th of December? Actually, the date was chosen not by the
    Christians, but by Romans, the traditional antagonists of the Early Church.</p>
    <p>Each year as the days became noticeably shorter in November and December,
    the Roman citizens feared that the earth may be &quot;dying&quot;. With the
    &quot;return of the sun&quot; at the end of December resulting in longer
    days, the Romans celebrated the &quot;Feast of the Sol Invictus&quot;
    (Unconquerable Sun&quot;) on December 25. Bishop Liberius of Rome ordered in
    354 that all Christians celebrate the birth of the Christ child on that day.
    Scholars believe that the bishop chose this date so that Christians, still
    members of an &quot;outlaw religion&quot; in the eyes of the Romans, could
    celebrate the birth of their Savior without danger of revealing their
    religious conviction, while their Roman neighbors celebrated another event.</p>

  <p><b>The Winter Solstice - Day of the Sun's birth</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p. 89] A very general observance required that on the 25th of December
    the birth of the “new Sun” should be celebrated, when after the winter
    solstice the days began to lengthen and the “invincible” star triumphed
    again over darkness. It is certain that the date of this Natalis Invicti was
    selected by the Church as the commemoration of the Nativity of Jesus, which
    was previously confused with the Epiphany. In appointing this day,
    universally marked by pious rejoicing, which were as far as possible
    retained,—for instance the old chariot-races were preserved,—the
    ecclesiastical authorities purified in some degree the customs which they
    could not abolish. This substitution, which took place at Rome probably
    between 354 and 360, was adopted throughout the Empire, and that is why we
    still celebrate Christmas on the 25th of December.</p>
    <p>The pre-eminence assigned to the dies Solis also certainly [p. 90]
    contributed to the general recognition of Sunday as a holiday. This is
    connected with a more important fact, namely, the adoption of the week by
    all European nations.</p>

    <p>The reasons for celebrating our major feasts when we do are many and
    varied. In general, however, it is true that many of them have at least an
    indirect connection with the pre-Christian feasts celebrated about the same
    time of year — feasts centering around the harvest, the rebirth of the sun
    at the winter solstice (now Dec. 21, but Dec. 25 in the old Julian
    calendar), the renewal of nature in spring, and so on.</p>

  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="1">
  <p>The above information may come as something of a shock to some people, but
  not to others, I am sure. As you can see, December 25th has absolutely no
  biblical foundation as a day of Christian worship. In fact the evidence from
  the Bible tends to eliminate December (it being the dead of winter) as a
  possible month for the birth of Christ. Just as Sunday keeping is commanded
  only by Catholic Tradition, so Christmas (Christ's Mass) is founded solely on
  the authority of Catholicism, which picked the day so as to coincide with the
  pagan Sun worshipping observance of the Winter Solstice.</p>
  <p>Protestants who observe Christmas, and have Christmas eve midnight
  services, are keeping a holy day of obligation
  decreed by the Papacy, a Roman Catholic Tradition, just as they are doing with Sunday keeping. The Bible says nothing of
  celebrating the birth of Christ, and does not even give us the specific day of
  the year of the event. Why then, is it one of the most celebrated days of the
  &quot;Bible Only&quot; Protestant Christian calendar? Every year you will hear
  people, even pastors, bemoaning the paganization of Christmas - how Santa
  Claus and greed have taken over this most solemn and holy day. Little do they
  apparently know, the 25th of December was <em>never</em> holy to God, but has
  long been a pagan festival season celebrating the birth of the Sun. In keeping
  Christ's Mass, nominal &quot;Bible Only&quot; Protestants are, in practice,
  tacitly acknowledging the authority of Roman Catholic Tradition, which in
  principle they reject.</p>
