  &quot;TO PROCLAIM THE SABBATH MORE FULLY.&quot;
  </font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<font size="2">N</font> &quot;Early 
  Writings,&quot; p. 27, we find the following words:— </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and 
    will be, the separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers, 
    and that the Sabbath is the great question to unite the hearts of God's 
    dear, waiting saints. I saw that God had children who do not see and keep 
    the Sabbath. They have not rejected the light upon it. And at the 
    commencement of the time of trouble, we were filled with the Holy Ghost as 
    we went forth and proclaimed the Sabbath more fully.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This language is commented upon by the 
  author in the &quot;Supplement to Experience and Views,&quot; p. 1, as follows :— </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This view was given in 1847, when 
    there were but very few of the Advent brethren observing the Sabbath, and of 
    these but few supposed that its observance was of sufficient importance to 
    draw a line between the people of God and unbelievers. Now the fulfillment 
    of that view is beginning to be seen. 'The commencement of the time of 
    trouble,' here mentioned, does not refer to the time when the plagues shall 
    begin to be poured out, but to a short period just before they are poured 
    out, while Christ is in the sanctuary. At that time, while the work of 
    salvation is closing, trouble will be coming on the earth, and the nations 
    will be angry, yet held in cheek so as not to prevent the work of the third 
    angel. At that time the 'latter rain,' or refreshing from the presence of 
    the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the third angel, and 
    prepare the saints to stand in the period when the seven last plagues shall 
    be poured out.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is certainly something very 
  remarkable in this language, both as a prediction and in the way in which it 
  is now being fulfilled. The Sabbath truth is here particularly alluded to, and 
  it is said that at the &quot;commencement of the time of trouble,&quot; at the time of 
  the &quot;latter rain,&quot; when power will be given to the loud voice of the third 
  angel, then the people of God will go forth to proclaim &quot;the Sabbath more 
  fully.&quot; <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a people we have always congratulated ourselves on the 
  completeness of the arguments for the Sabbath truth; they have seemed as full 
  as they could well be, and yet <u>here is a time, and it is the present, when it 
  is to be preached &quot;more fully.&quot;</u> Our recent experiences, our institutes and campmeetings, and the additional light we are receiving, is illustrating how 
  this is to be brought about. The true relation of the Sabbath to the people of 
  God as a sign of the creative and regenerating power of Christ, expressing all 
  that Christ is to his people, is a grand truth, the force of which we have not 
  clearly understood in the past. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as it dawns upon our minds, <u>there is 
  a power in the Sabbath truth we have never known before</u>. The same is true of 
  other features of present truth, at least to some extent. And it is under the 
  impulse of these truths thus proclaimed and lived out that the third angel's 
  message is to go with great power. <font face="Times New Roman">— </font>G. C. Tenny, <a href="http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH18930711-V70-28/index.djvu?djvuopts&amp;page=8"><i>Review and
