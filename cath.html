  <p>The following quotes are from The Catholic Encyclopedia, Revised and
  Updated, Published by Thomas Nelson Publishers, Edited by Robert C. Broderick,
  Copyright 1987. It bears the NIHIL OBSTAT and IMPRIMATUR of the Catholic

  <p><b>ANTICHRIST</b> ( page 40)-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is no specific one person or thing indicated by the term. Rather
    the title of Antichrist may be given to any person, idea, or group of
    persons who opposed, are opposing, or intend to oppose Christ and His
    Church. In particular this title is applicable only to the one enemy who
    will appear before the Last Judgment and draw many faithful away before
    being defeated by Christ. St. Paul calls this enemy &quot;the man of
    lawlessness&quot; (2 Thes. 2:3); this is not to be considered literally but
    as apocalyptic language in keeping with Rv. (12:12). In brief, it is the one
    who will attempt to substitute himself for God.</p>
    <p>The opinion of many scholars of Scripture is that the Antichrist is not
    the incarnation of antichristian hostility but rather an eschatological
    personage who will appear at the end of the world. The Church that Christ
    founded is of course guaranteed against any form of Antichrist until the end
    of time.</p>

  <p><b>APOCALYPTIC NUMBER </b>(page 43)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A mystical number, especially 666 as stated in Revelation 13:18, is the
    &quot;number of the beast.&quot; It was an ancient practice to have the
    letters of the Greek or Hebrew alphabets stand for a number (thus A=1).
    Using this formula, a name could be stated as the sum of its letters, as the
    name of Jesus in Greek amounted to 888. The number 666 is explained thus:
    777 being the perfect number and 888 meaning Christ or each unit of 7
    augmented by 1, then 666, or each unit of 7 lessened by 1, was that of
    Antichrist. In the derived name then, it could be the sum of Nero. However,
    the number, apart from the many conjectures, might stand for any
    &quot;Antichrist&quot; or anyone who in the time would stand against Christ.
    This is a condemned form of numerology that has no place in the Christian
    understanding of the message of Christ.</p>

  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="1">
  <p><b>BABEL, TOWER OF</b> (page 63)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This structure was near the site of ancient Babylon, probably at what is
    today Bias-Nimrud. The inhabitants started to build this great stage- tower
    or ziggurat but could not complete it (Gn. 11:1-9). The popular story
    interprets the Hebrew world <em>babel</em>, which means
    &quot;confusion.&quot; In this version, by miraculous intervention God
    introduced different languages among the population (Hebrew word <em>balel</em>)
    and thus effected the stopping of the work, which was one of pride and
    arrogance together with a will to intimidate enemies. The tower had risen to
    a height of 60 feet. It is more accurately accepted that because of discord
    and lack of harmony in settling on a policy, the work was halted and a
    migration started. As early as the fourth century, St. Gregory of Nyssa was
    emphatic in declaring that God did not impose a variety of languages upon
    mankind. Etymologically, the name <em>babel</em> means &quot;gate of
    God.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="20%" align="center" size="1">
  <p>Can you believe it??? The Roman Catholic Church is immune to the
  AntiChrist, investigating 666 in condemned, and the Bible relates a popular
  but unfounded story of God intervening and confusing the speech of the
  Babylonians by introducing the various languages. Clearly St. Gregory of Nyssa
  was THE authority on this matter, wasn't he?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all
    one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained
    from them, which they have imagined to do.<br>
    Gen 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
    may not understand one another's speech.<br>
    Gen 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all
    the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br>
    Gen 11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
    there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD
    scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Bible has just been reduced to that of legend, fable, mythology in an
  officially endorsed publication of the Roman Catholic Church! Why? Simple,
  they don't want Catholics to know the truth about who and what the Catholic
  Church really is..... Mystery Babylon, the very lair of the AntiChrist and the
  source of doctrinal apostasy and confusion!</p>
  <p>2 Tim 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine;
  but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
  itching ears;<br>
  2 Tim 4:4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be
  turned unto fables.</p>
