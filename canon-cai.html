      <tr>
        <td width="100%"><b>3. The New Testament refers to Jewish
scripture as the Law and the Prophets (Matthew 7:12, 22:40, Luke 16:16,
John 1:45, Acts 13:15, Romans 3:21).&nbsp; The Law and the Prophets are
the first two division of the Jewish scripture.&nbsp; Does it show that
it approves the Jewish scripture?&nbsp; Furthermore in Luke 24:44 Jesus
approved the Jewish scripture when He mentioned The Law, the Prophets
and Psalms.</b>&nbsp; The phrase "the Law and the Prophets" indicates
that the Jewish scripture was still open-ended in Jesus time.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Note that both the Septuagint and the Jewish scripture have Law
and Prophets.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Luke 24:44 Jesus said that He <i>fulfilled
the prophecies</i> in the books of Law, the Prophets and
Psalms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Psalms is one book of the Writings of the Jewish
scripture, which also includes Daniel.&nbsp; Jesus identified Himself
to be the Son of Man mentioned in Daniel 7:13, so it is strange that He
did not include this book in Luke 24:44.&nbsp; Luke 24:44 may even
indicate that Jesus placed Daniel as one book of the Prophets, which
means He followed the Septuagint's grouping of books.
        <p><b>4. In </b><span style="color: black;"><b>Luke 11:50-51
Jesus mentioned the names Abel (Genesis 4:8) and Zechariah who is
identified to be the one in 2 Chronicles 24:20-22.&nbsp; Since Genesis
and Chronicles are the first and the last book in the present Jewish
scripture then the above verses prove that the Old Testament of the
Christians is the same with that of the Jews.&nbsp;</b> However there
are a number of persons with the name Zechariah in the Bible.&nbsp;
Parallel verse in Matthew 23:35 says that Zechariah was the son of <i>Barachiah</i>
while Zechariah in 2 Chronicles 24:20-22 was the son of <i>Jehoiada</i>.&nbsp;
More suitable candidate is the prophet Zechariah son of <i>Berechiah</i>
(Zechariah 1:1).&nbsp; Bear also in mind that in Jesus time there were
no books like we have today.&nbsp; All books of the Scripture in that
time were written in scrolls, each book in one scroll.&nbsp; Whilst
grouping them was possible, they had stack of scrolls, i.e. there was
no clear order of the books.&nbsp; Even after Codex (plural Codices)
which resembled modern book was later introduced to replace scrolls,
the arrangement of the books of the Bible might be different with that
of today.&nbsp; Encyclopedia Judaica Volume 4 page 829-830 gives eight
different ancient arrangements of the Writings with Chronicles appears
as the first or the last book.&nbsp; Leningrad Codex, the standard
Masoretic text of the Jewish scripture has Chronicles as the first book
of the Writings.&nbsp; Thus Chronicles is not always the last book of
the Jewish scripture.</span></p>
        <p><b>13. We should let the Jews determine the canon of the Old
Testament (39 books) because they were entrusted with the oracles of
God (Romans 3:8)</b>.&nbsp; Catholics do not deny that God spoke in the
past through Jewish prophets (Hebrews 1:1) and their words were put in
written form by the Jews; that is what Paul meant in Romans 3:8.&nbsp;
Bear in mind that deuterocanonical books were also written by
Jews.&nbsp; During Jesus and His apostles' time the canon of the Old
Testament was still open-ended.&nbsp; They never gave us the list of
inspired books of both the Old and New Testaments.&nbsp; If the Church
later through the guidance of the Holy Spirit defined the canon of the
New Testament then why she could not define the canon of the Old
Testament as well? </p>

  <p><u><b><font size="4">"The Law and the Prophets and the Psalms"</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 24:44 And he said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">These
are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that
all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the <b>law of
Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms</b>, concerning me.</font><br>
Luke 24:45 Then opened he their understanding, <b>that they might
understand the scriptures</b>,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">"The Law and the Prophets"</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 7:12 <font color="#ff0000">Therefore all things whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is <b>the
law and the prophets.</b></font></p>
    <p>Mat 22:40 <font color="#ff0000">On these two commandments hang
all <b>the law and the prophets.</b></font></p>
    <p>Luke 16:16 <font color="#ff0000"><b>The law and the prophets</b>
were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and
every man presseth into it.</font></p>
    <p>John 1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have
found him, of whom Moses in <b>the law, and the prophets</b>, did
write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.<br>
    <br>
Acts 13:15 And after the reading of <b>the law and the prophets</b>
the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and
brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</p>
    <p>Rom 3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is
manifested, being witnessed by <b>the law and the prophets</b>;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Upon reading the above verses, it is evident that "the law and the
prophets" does <i>not</i> convey any uncertainty in the canon of
scripture at all, rather it is clearly an abbreviated or shorthand way
of referring to <i> the entire span of scripture</i>. The phrase "the
law and the prophets" is not exclusionary or indistinct, rather it
includes all of the inspired word of God. There is another similar
phrase with <i>exactly</i> the same meaning:</p>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">"Moses and the Prophets"</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 16:29&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">Abraham saith unto him,
They have <b>Moses and the prophets</b>; let them hear them.</font><br>
    <br>
Luke 16:31&nbsp; <font color="#ff0000">And he said unto him, If they
hear not <b>Moses and the prophets</b>, neither will they be
persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</font><br>
    <br>
Luke 24:27&nbsp; And beginning at <b>Moses and all the prophets</b>,
he expounded unto them <b>in all the scriptures</b> the things
concerning himself.<br>
    <br>
John 1:45&nbsp; Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have
found him, of whom <b>Moses in the law, and the prophets</b>, did
write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.<br>
    <br>
Acts 26:22&nbsp; Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto
this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things
than those which <b>the prophets and Moses</b> did say should come:<br>
    <br>
Acts 28:23&nbsp; And when they had appointed him a day, there came many
to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom
of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of <b>the law of
Moses, and out of the prophets</b>, from morning till evening.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Please take special note of Luke 24:27 above. Did the phrase
"Moses and all the prophets" exclude any of scripture? No, not when it
says that Christ then proceeded to explain from <i>all the scriptures</i>.
If "Moses and all the prophets" covers all of scripture, then so does
"the law and the prophets".</p>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">"The Scriptures"</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 21:42 Jesus saith unto them, <font color="#ff0000">Did ye
never read in <b>the scriptures</b>, The stone which the builders
rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's
doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</font></p>
    <p>Mat 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, <font
 color="#ff0000">Ye do err, not knowing <b>the scriptures</b>, nor the
power of God.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn
within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to
us <b>the scriptures</b>?</p>
    <p>John 5:39 <font color="#ff0000">Search <b>the scriptures</b>;
for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which
testify of me.</font></p>
    <p>Acts 17:2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and
three sabbath days reasoned with them out of <b>the scriptures</b>,<br>
    <font color="#ff0000"><br>
    </font>Acts 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica,
in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched
    <b>the scriptures</b> daily, whether those things were so.</p>
    <p>Acts 18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria,
an eloquent man, and mighty in <b>the scriptures</b>, came to Ephesus.</p>
    <p>Rom 1:1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an
apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,<br>
Rom 1:2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in <b>the holy
scriptures</b>,)</p>
    <p>2 Tim 3:15 And that from a child thou hast known <b>the holy
scriptures</b>, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through
faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The use of "the scriptures" in the above verses from the New
Testament also indicate that the full extent of scripture was known and
understood by <i>both</i> the speaker and audience. And the following
verse testifies to an already defined and accepted Old Testament canon:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 3:14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day
remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of <b>the old
testament</b>; which veil is done away in Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So as the above verses indicate, the Old Testament canon of
scripture in apostolic times was already fixed, understood and accepted
by the Jews, and was <i>anything but</i> open-ended, vague, or poorly
defined.</p>
  <p> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);">
Note that both the Septuagint and the Jewish scripture have Law and
Prophets.</span></p>
  <p>That statement appears to be intentionally ambiguous and
obfuscatory. Let's clarify. Are the same books of the Law and the
Prophets of the Hebrew Canon also found in the Septuagint? Yes, they
most certainly are. However, the Septuagint <i>has never had the
identical division and grouping of the Hebrew Canon into the Law and
Prophets (and Writings)</i>, which is what the above statement seeks to
  <i>conceal</i> from the reader. See the charts in my essay on the <b><a
 href="hebrew-canon.html">Hebrew Canon</a></b>.
There is simply no way the remarks of Christ can be applied to the
Septuagint.</p>
  <p><u><span
 style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);">In
Luke 24:44 Jesus said that He </span><i><span
 style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);"> fulfilled the prophecies</span></i><span
 style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);"> in
the books of Law, the Prophets and Psalms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Psalms is one
book of the Writings of the Jewish scripture, which also includes
Daniel.&nbsp; Jesus identified Himself to be the Son of Man mentioned
in Daniel 7:13, so it is strange that He did not include this book in
Luke 24:44.</span></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 24:44 And he said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">These
are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that
all things must be fulfilled, which were written in <b>the law of
Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms</b>, concerning me.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus is referring here to the three divisions of the Hebrew
Canon, and by saying "<font color="#ff0000">in the law of Moses, and in
the prophets, and in the psalms" </font>he means <i>every</i> book of
the Old Testament, <i> including</i> Daniel. So it is not at all
"strange" that Daniel is not explicitly mentioned in Luke 24:44,
because Daniel is obviously included implicitly in context.</p>
  <p><u><span
 style="font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);">Luke
24:44 may even indicate that Jesus placed Daniel as one book of the
Prophets, which means He followed the Septuagint's grouping of books.</span></u></p>
  <p>That assertion is absolutely devoid of any common sense logic at
all. There is absolutely nothing in the cited verses that in any way
indicate that Christ was endorsing the canon of <i>any</i> version of
the Septuagint (the three oldest versions of the Septuagint all <i>differ</i>
in the books they include, and their sequence!), much less indicating
the placement of the book of Daniel in the Prophets (rather than the
third and last group, the Psalms / Writings). To suggest that Jesus was
referring to the Septuagint is to say that black may in fact really be
white <font face="Times New Roman">&#9472;</font> it is utter nonsense. See
the TaNaKh and<b> </b>Septuagint charts in my essay on the <b> <a

  <i>However there are a number of persons with the name Zechariah in
the Bible.&nbsp; Parallel verse in Matthew 23:35 says that Zechariah
was the son of Barachiah while Zechariah in 2 Chronicles 24:20-22 was
the son of Jehoiada.&nbsp; More suitable candidate is the prophet
Zechariah son of Berechiah (Zechariah 1:1).</i></span></p>
  <p>The writer is totally ignoring the essential characteristic that
identifies the Zechariah in question, that he was<i> martyred in the
temple court:</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 11:51 <font color="#ff0000">From the blood of Abel unto
the blood of <b>Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the
temple</b>: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this
generation.<br>
    </font>Luke 11:52 <font color="#ff0000">Woe unto you, lawyers! for
ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves,
and them that were entering in ye hindered.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 23:35 <font color="#ff0000">That upon you may come all the
righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel
unto the blood of <b>Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between
the temple and the altar.</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is only <i>one</i> Zechariah that scripture tells us was
martyred in the temple's court.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Chr 24:20 And the Spirit of God came upon <b>Zechariah</b>
the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said
unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he
hath also forsaken you.<br>
2 Chr 24:21 And they conspired against him, and <b>stoned him with
stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
LORD</b>.<br>
2 Chr 24:22 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which
Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>King Joash, who had Zechariah stoned within the temple's court (2
Chr 24:20-22), was the 13th king of the northern kingdom of Israel, and
he ruled from 798-782 B.C. There can be no reasonable doubt that this
is <i>precisely</i> the Zechariah that Jesus was referring to, because
of the uniqueness of where he was martyred.</p>
  <p>Now, the author of the Old Testament book of Zechariah lived
during the reign of Darius I :</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Zec 1:1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came
the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of
Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The second year of the reign of Darius I (the great) is dated to
520 B.C., so this Zechariah, who authored the book by the same name,
lived some <i>250 years after</i> the Zechariah that 2 Chr 24:20-22
explicitly tells us was martyred in the temple court, and Chronicles <i>is</i>
the last book of the Hebrew canon, not Zechariah. Jesus was clearly
naming two well known<i> martyrs</i> to indicate the first and last
books of the canonical scriptures. It is simply ridiculous to suggest
that Mat 23:35 indicates the author of the Old Testament book of
Zechariah, when there is absolutely no evidence in scripture that he
was martyred, much less martyred in the temple court. </p>
  <p>That the author of Zechariah was the "son of Berechiah", and the
earlier martyred Zechariah was the "son of Barachias", may simply
indicate that the two had a common ancestor, or it may be that both men
had an ancestor with a similar name.</p>
  <p>The photo reprint of the 1899 Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible that I
have, interestingly enough, acknowledges in the footnotes for <i>both</i>
Matthew 23:35 and Luke 11:51, that the Zechariah martyred in 2
Chronicles is indicated. But a 1950 printing of the Douay-Rheims that I
have has no footnotes for those verses at all! What changed? I think it
has finally dawned on Catholics what the implications of referring to
the Zechariah in 2 Chronicles means, and they now realize they really
do <i>not</i> want to go there, because it clearly and logically
results in an endorsement of the Hebrew Canon of the Old Testament! </p>
  <p>The 1970 New American Bible for Catholics I have, in the footnote
for Matthew 23:35, wrongly asserts that the author of the Old Testament
book of Zechariah is indicated, while curiously it <i>also</i> refers
the reader to the footnote for Luke 11:51, which points rightly to the
Zechariah martyred in 2 Chronicles! So according to the more recent
NAB, <i>two different men</i> are meant in the <i>parallel</i>
passages of Matthew 23:35 and Luke 11:51! Amazing!</p>
  <p> <span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);">
Bear also in mind that in Jesus time there were no books like we have
today.&nbsp; All books of the Scripture in that time were written in
scrolls, each book in one scroll.&nbsp; Whilst grouping them was
possible, they had stack of scrolls, i.e. there was no clear order of
the books.&nbsp; Even after Codex (plural Codices) which resembled
modern book was later introduced to replace scrolls, the arrangement of
the books of the Bible might be different with that of today.</span></p>
  <p>Jesus said what He said, the way He said it, for a clear and
distinct reason. As discussed in my essay on the <b> <a
 href="hebrew-canon.html">Hebrew Canon</a></b>, it
is quite clear that by saying <i>from Able to Zacharias</i>, Jesus was
referring to the entire span of of the Hebrew scriptures, i.e., from
Genesis to 2 Chronicles. The above is nothing but an attempt to muddy
the waters, to obfuscate the truth and dissipate any understanding of
the clear intention of the words of Christ.</p>
  <p> <span
 style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 234);">
Encyclopedia Judaica Volume 4 page 829-830 gives eight different
ancient arrangements of the Writings with Chronicles appears as the
first or the last book.&nbsp; Leningrad Codex, the standard Masoretic
text of the Jewish scripture has Chronicles as the first book of the
Writings.&nbsp; Thus Chronicles is not always the last book of the
Jewish scripture.</span></p>
  <p>As I say in my essay:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Previous to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the two
oldest known complete Hebrew (Masoretic) texts of the Bible were the <a
 href="http://www.imj.org.il/eng/shrine/aleppo.html">Aleppo Codex</a>
dated to the 10th century A.D. and the <a
 href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/biblical_manuscripts/LeningradCodex.shtml">
Leningrad Codex</a>, dated to the early 11th century A.D. Both these
texts, attributed to Ben-Asher, placed Chronicles at the <i>beginning</i>
of the 3rd division, the Ketuvim (Writings). However, modern reprints
of the Leningrad Codex have moved the book of Chronicles back to its
tradition place at the end of the Ketuvim. See <img src="star.gif"
 border="0" height="12" width="16"> <a
 href="http://www.hendrickson.com/html/product/30890.acad.html?category=academic">
    <b>Biblia Hebraica Leningradensia</b></a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That there have been a few variant orderings of the Ketuvim,
placing Chronicles as the first book of the third division, is not
particularly significant, as that bit of trivia in no way impeaches the
very clear intent of the context of Christ's words in Matthew 23:35,
Luke 11:51, and Luke 24:44. Jesus was very clearly and explicitly
referring to the order and divisions of the books in the Hebrew Bible
as the complete span of scripture in His day, and there is no possible
way His words can be taken to mean anything else. I think we have a
deliberate trap set by Jesus Christ to ensnare and expose those who He
knew would attempt to corrupt the Old Testament Hebrew canon by adding
spurious apocryphal books, and the trap has worked marvelously.</p>

  <p>The assertion that the Old Testament canon was still open-ended in
apostolic times is flatly contradicted by the collective words of
Christ in Matthew 23:35, Luke 11:51, and Luke 24:44, which firmly and
unequivocally endorse the content, ordering and divisions of only the
Hebrew canon. The deutero/apocryphal books, while written by Jews, were
never universally accepted as canonical by the majority of the Jewish

  <p>It can be concluded with confidence, from the words of Christ
cited, that every Roman Catholic council that defined the canon,
including the allegedly infallible declaration of the Council of Trent,
was in error, and every Catholic Bible printed contains non-canonical
apocryphal books that are not a part of the inspired Old Testament.</p>

        <p align="left">B. <font color="#ff0000"><i><b>The New
Testament attests conformity to the Jewish Scriptures</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left">6. A twofold conviction is apparent in other
texts: on the one hand, what is written in the Jewish Scriptures must
of necessity be fulfilled because it reveals the plan of God which
cannot fail to be accomplished; on the other hand, the life, death and
resurrection of Christ are fully in accord with the Scriptures.</p>
        <p align="left">1. <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>Necessity of
fulfilling the Scriptures</i></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#ff0000">The clearest
expression of this is found in the words addressed by the risen Christ
to his disciples, in the Gospel of Luke: <i>“These are my words that I
spoke to you while I was still with you — that everything written about
me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must (dei) </i>be
fulfilled” (Lk 24:44).</font></b> This assertion shows the basis of the
necessity (<i>dei, </i>“must”) for the paschal mystery of Jesus,
affirmed in numerous passages in the Gospels: “The Son of Man <i>must </i>undergo
great suffering...and after three days rise again”;<sup>15</sup> “But
how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled which say it <i>must </i>happen
this way?” (Mt 26:54); “This Scripture <i>must </i>be fulfilled in
me” (Lk 22:37).</p>
        <p align="left">Because <font color="#ff0000"><b>what is
written in the Old Testament “must” be fulfilled</b></font>, the events
take place “<i>so that</i>” it is fulfilled. This is what Matthew often
expresses in the infancy narrative, later on in Jesus' public life<sup>16</sup>
and for the whole passion (Mt 26:56). Mark has a parallel to the last
mentioned passage in a powerfully elliptic phrase: “But let the
Scriptures be fulfilled” (Mk 14:49). Luke does not use this expression
but John has recourse to it almost as often as Matthew does.<sup>17</sup>
The Gospels' insistence on the purpose of these events “so that the
Scriptures be fulfilled”<sup>18</sup> attributes the utmost importance
to the Jewish Scriptures. It is clearly understood that these events
would be meaningless if they did not correspond to what the Scriptures
say. It would not be a question there of the realisation of God's plan.

        <p align="left">2.<i> <font color="#ff0000"><b>Conformity to
the Scriptures</b></font></i></p>
        <p align="left">7. ... In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus
appropriates a saying of Isaiah (Lk 4:17-21; Is 61:1-2) to define his
mission as he begins his ministry. The ending of the Gospel expands
this perspective when it speaks of <font color="#ff0000"><b>fulfilling
“all that is written” about Jesus (Lk 24:44).</b></font></p>
        <p align="left">On that point, it is essential, according to
Jesus, to “hear <font color="#ff0000"><b>Moses and the prophets</b></font>”,
the ending of the parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Lk 16:29-31)
drives home the point: without a docile listening, even the greatest
prodigies are of no avail.</p>

        <p align="left">A. <i><b>Christian Understanding of the
relationships between the Old and New Testaments</b></i></p>
        <p align="left">1. <i>Affirmation of a reciprocal relationship</i></p>
        <p align="left">By “Old Testament” the Christian Church has no
wish to suggest that the Jewish Scriptures are outdated or surpassed.<sup>37</sup>
On the contrary, it has always affirmed that the Old Testament and the
New Testament are inseparable. Their first relationship is precisely
that. At the beginning of the second century, when Marcion wished to
discard the Old Testament, he met with vehement resistance from the
post-apostolic Church. Moreover, his rejection of the Old Testament led
him to disregard a major portion of the New — he retained only the
Gospel of Luke and some Pauline Letters — which clearly showed that his
position was indefensible. <font color="#ff0000"><b>It is in the light
of the Old Testament that the New understands the life, death and
glorification of Jesus</b></font> (cf. 1 Co 15:3-4).</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#ff0000">This relationship is
also reciprocal: on the one hand, the New Testament demands to be read
in the light of the Old </font><font color="#111111">[Testament]</font><font
 color="#ff0000">, but it also invites a “re-reading” of the Old </font>
[Testament]<font color="#ff0000"> in the light of Jesus Christ (cf. Lk
24:45). How is this “re-reading” to be done? It extends to “all the
Scriptures” (Lk 24:27) to “everything written in the Law of Moses, the
Prophets and the Psalms” (24:44)</font></b>, but the New Testament only
offers a limited number of examples, not a methodology.</p>

  <p align="left">Now Mr. Hartono would have us believe that the
reference to Psalms in Luke 24:47 is strictly limited to that book
alone, and that the rest of the books of the third division of the
Hebrew canon (Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations,
Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles)
are to be <i>excluded</i>. Were <i>none</i> of these books accepted
as canonical by the Jews in the time of Christ? The Pontifical Bible
Commission, in context, apparently considers Luke 24:44 to refer to the
whole of the Hebrew Old Testament - “all the Scriptures” (Lk 24:27),
and does not specifically exclude any of the other books of the third
division that begins with Psalms. Perhaps Mr. Hartono should write the
commission and inform them of their misinterpretation.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Hartono also makes this assertion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><i> <span
 style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 202);" lang="en-ca">The

refer to list of books known to us as the Old Testament but to the old
covenant of Law from Moses.</span></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Again, continuing with quotes from the Pontifical
Biblical Commission's document:</p>

SCRIPTURES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE ARE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE CHRISTIAN
BIBLE</b></p>
        <p>2. ... </p>
        <p>A perennial manifestation of this link to their beginnings
is the acceptance by Christians of the Sacred Scriptures of the Jewish
people as the Word of God addressed to themselves as well. Indeed, the
Church has accepted as inspired by God all the writings contained in
the Hebrew Bible as well as those in the Greek Bible. <font
 color="#ff0000">The title “Old Testament” given to this collection of
writings is an expression coined by the apostle Paul to designate the
writings attributed to Moses (cf. 2 Co 3:14-15).<b> Its scope has been
extended, since the end of the second century, to include other Jewish
writings in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek.</b></font></p>

        <p align="left">2.<i> <b><font color="#ff0000">Re-reading the
Old Testament in the light of Christ</font></b></i></p>
        <p align="left">The examples given show that different methods
were used, taken from their cultural surroundings, as we have seen
above.<sup>38</sup> The texts speak of typology<sup>39</sup> and of
reading in the light of the Spirit (2 Co 3:14-17). These suggest a
twofold manner of reading, in its original meaning at the time of
writing, and a subsequent interpretation in the light of Christ.</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#ff0000"><b>In Judaism,
re-readings were commonplace. The Old Testament itself points the way.</b></font>
For example, in the episode of the manna, while not denying the
original gift, the meaning is deepened to become a symbol of the Word
through which God continually nourishes his people (cf. Dt 8:2-3). The
Books of Chronicles are a re-reading of the Book of Genesis and the
Books of Samuel and Kings. What is specific to the Christian re-reading
is that it is done, as we have said, in the light of Christ.</p>
        <p align="left">This new interpretation does not negate the
original meaning. <font color="#ff0000"><b>Paul clearly states that
“the very words of God were entrusted” to the Israelites (Rm 3:2) and
he takes it for granted that these words of God could be read and
understood before the coming of Christ. Although he speaks of a
blindness of the Jews with regard to “the reading of the Old Testament”
(2 Co 3:14), he does not mean a total incapacity to read, only an
inability to read it in the light of Christ.</b></font></p>

  </div>
  <p align="left">In context, the Pontifical Biblical Commission is
clearly interpreting 2 Cor. 3:14 to mean the <i>entire Old Testament</i>
of the Jews, and <i>not</i> just the Old Covenant Law from Moses.
Again, it seems that Mr. Hartono should inform Rome of their error.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">2 Cor 3:14 But their minds were blinded: for until
this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old
testament; which veil is done away in Christ.<br>
2 Cor 3:15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon
their heart.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Paul's remarks are not intended to completely exclude
of the rest of the Old Testament. This same "veil" over the Old
Testament is also evident in Luke:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Luke 16:29 <font color="#ff0000">Abraham saith
unto him, They have <b>Moses and the prophets</b>; let them hear them.</font><br>
Luke 16:30 <font color="#ff0000">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but
if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</font><br>
Luke 16:31 <font color="#ff0000">And he said unto him, <b>If they
hear not Moses and the prophets</b>, neither will they be persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">This blindness to the gospel of Jesus Christ for the
Jew applied not only to the writings of Moses (though they are clearly
emphasized by Paul), but to the whole of the Hebrew Old Testament
(Moses and the prophets), the prophecies of which clearly pointed to,
and were fulfilled by only one man, Jesus of Nazareth. And this was
just as true at the time Paul wrote that passage in Corinthians as it
is today, though the Pontifical Biblical Commission maintains it was
not until the second century that this wider understanding of the term
was applied. </p>
  <p align="left">While <i>I</i> do not base what I believe on the
opinions of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, is not a Roman Catholic
subject to, and bound by, their Magisterial authority in such matters?
Or, are Roman Catholics free to give their own private interpretations
regarding scripture, even if it contradicts Magisterial teaching?</p>
