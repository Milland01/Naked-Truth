  <p align="center"><b><i><font SIZE="+1">DIES DOMINI</font></i></b> </p>
  <p align="center">OF THE HOLY FATHER JOHN PAUL II <br>
  TO THE BISHOPS, CLERGY AND FAITHFUL OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH <br>
  ON KEEPING THE LORD'S DAY HOLY &nbsp; <br>
  &nbsp;<a NAME="intro"></a> </p>
  <p align="left"><i>My esteemed Brothers in the Episcopate</i> <br>
  <i>and the Priesthood,</i> <br>
  <i>Dear Brothers and Sisters!</i> </p>
  <p><a name="s1"></a>1. The Lord's Day &#151; as Sunday was called from Apostolic times(<a
  HREF="#1">1</a>)<a name="1b"></a> &#151; has always been accorded special attention in the
  history of the Church because of its close connection with the very core of the Christian
  mystery. In fact, in the weekly reckoning of time Sunday recalls the day of Christ's
  Resurrection. It is <i>Easter</i> which returns week by week, celebrating Christ's victory
  over sin and death, the fulfilment in him of the first creation and the dawn of &quot;the
  new creation&quot; (cf. <i>2 Cor</i> 5:17). It is the day which recalls in grateful
  adoration the world's first day and looks forward in active hope to &quot;the last
  day&quot;, when Christ will come in glory (cf. <i>Acts</i> 1:11; 1 <i>Th</i> 4:13-17) and
  all things will be made new (cf. <i>Rev</i> 21:5). </p>
  <p>Rightly, then, the Psalmist's cry is applied to Sunday: &quot;This is the day which the
  Lord has made: let us rejoice and be glad in it&quot; (<i>Ps</i> 118:24). This invitation
  to joy, which the Easter liturgy makes its own, reflects the astonishment which came over
  the women who, having seen the crucifixion of Christ, found the tomb empty when they went
  there &quot;very early on the first day after the Sabbath&quot; (<i>Mk</i> 16:2). It is an
  invitation to relive in some way the experience of the two disciples of Emmaus, who felt
  their hearts &quot;burn within them&quot; as the Risen One walked with them on the road,
  explaining the Scriptures and revealing himself in &quot;the breaking of the bread&quot;
  (cf. <i>Lk</i> 24:32,35). And it echoes the joy &#151; at first uncertain and then
  overwhelming &#151; which the Apostles experienced on the evening of that same day, when
  they were visited by the Risen Jesus and received the gift of his peace and of his Spirit
  (cf. <i>Jn</i> 20:19-23). </p>
  <p><a name="s2"></a>2. The Resurrection of Jesus is the fundamental event upon which
  Christian faith rests (cf. <i>1 Cor</i> 15:14). It is an astonishing reality, fully
  grasped in the light of faith, yet historically attested to by those who were privileged
  to see the Risen Lord. It is a wondrous event which is not only absolutely unique in human
  history, but which lies <i>at the very heart of the mystery of time</i>. In fact,
  &quot;all time belongs to [Christ] and all the ages&quot;, as the evocative liturgy of the
  Easter Vigil recalls in preparing the Paschal Candle. Therefore, in commemorating the day
  of Christ's Resurrection not just once a year but every Sunday, the Church seeks to
  indicate to every generation the true fulcrum of history, to which the mystery of the
  world's origin and its final destiny leads. </p>
  <p>It is right, therefore, to claim, in the words of a fourth century homily, that
  &quot;the Lord's Day&quot; is &quot;the lord of days&quot;.(<a HREF="#2">2</a>)<a
  name="2b"></a> Those who have received the grace of faith in the Risen Lord cannot fail to
  grasp the significance of this day of the week with the same deep emotion which led Saint
  Jerome to say: &quot;Sunday is the day of the Resurrection, it is the day of Christians,
  it is our day&quot;.(<a HREF="#3">3</a>)<a name="3b"></a> For Christians, Sunday is
  &quot;the fundamental feastday&quot;,(<a HREF="#4">4</a>)<a name="4b"></a> established not
  only to mark the succession of time but to reveal time's deeper meaning. </p>
  <p><a name="s3"></a>3. The fundamental importance of Sunday has been recognized through
  two thousand years of history and was emphatically restated by the Second Vatican Council:
  &quot;Every seven days, the Church celebrates the Easter mystery. This is a tradition
  going back to the Apostles, taking its origin from the actual day of Christ's Resurrection
  &#151; a day thus appropriately designated 'the Lord's Day'.&quot;(<a HREF="#4">5</a>)<a
  name="5b"></a> Paul VI emphasized this importance once more when he approved the new
  General Roman Calendar and the Universal Norms which regulate the ordering of the
  Liturgical Year.(<a HREF="#6">6</a>)<a name="6b"></a> The coming of the Third Millennium,
  which calls believers to reflect upon the course of history in the light of Christ, also
  invites them to rediscover with new intensity the meaning of Sunday: its
  &quot;mystery&quot;, its celebration, its significance for Christian and human life. </p>
  <p>I note with pleasure that in the years since the Council this important theme has
  prompted not only many interventions by you, dear Brother Bishops, as teachers of the
  faith, but also different pastoral strategies which &#151; with the support of your clergy
  &#151; you have developed either individually or jointly. On the threshold of the Great
  Jubilee of the Year 2000, it has been my wish to offer you this Apostolic Letter in order
  to support your pastoral efforts in this vital area. But at the same time I wish to turn
  to all of you, Christ's faithful, as though I were spiritually present in all the
  communities in which you gather with your Pastors each Sunday to celebrate the Eucharist
  and &quot;the Lord's Day&quot;. Many of the insights and intuitions which prompt this
  Apostolic Letter have grown from my episcopal service in Krakow and, since the time when I
  assumed the ministry of Bishop of Rome and Successor of Peter, in the visits to the Roman
  parishes which I have made regularly on the Sundays of the different seasons of the
  Liturgical Year. I see this Letter as continuing the lively exchange which I am always
  happy to have with the faithful, as I reflect with you on the meaning of Sunday and
  underline the reasons for living Sunday as truly &quot;the Lord's Day&quot;, also in the
  changing circumstances of our own times. </p>
  <p><a name="s4"></a>4. Until quite recently, it was easier in traditionally Christian
  countries to keep Sunday holy because it was an almost universal practice and because,
  even in the organization of civil society, Sunday rest was considered a fixed part of the
  work schedule. Today, however, even in those countries which give legal sanction to the
  festive character of Sunday, changes in socioeconomic conditions have often led to
  profound modifications of social behaviour and hence of the character of Sunday. The
  custom of the &quot;weekend&quot; has become more widespread, a weekly period of respite,
  spent perhaps far from home and often involving participation in cultural, political or
  sporting activities which are usually held on free days. This social and cultural
  phenomenon is by no means without its positive aspects if, while respecting true values,
  it can contribute to people's development and to the advancement of the life of society as
  a whole. All of this responds not only to the need for rest, but also to the need for
  celebration which is inherent in our humanity. Unfortunately, when Sunday loses its
  fundamental meaning and becomes merely part of a &quot;weekend&quot;, it can happen that
  people stay locked within a horizon so limited that they can no longer see &quot;the
  heavens&quot;.(<a HREF="#7">7</a>)<a name="7b"></a> Hence, though ready to celebrate, they
  are really incapable of doing so. </p>
  <p>The disciples of Christ, however, are asked to avoid any confusion between the
  celebration of Sunday, which should truly be a way of keeping the Lord's Day holy, and the
  &quot;weekend&quot;, understood as a time of simple rest and relaxation. This will require
  a genuine spiritual maturity, which will enable Christians to &quot;be what they
  are&quot;, in full accordance with the gift of faith, always ready to give an account of
  the hope which is in them (cf. 1 <i>Pt</i> 3:15). In this way, they will be led to a
  deeper understanding of Sunday, with the result that, even in difficult situations, they
  will be able to live it in complete docility to the Holy Spirit. </p>
  <p><a name="s5"></a>5. From this perspective, the situation appears somewhat mixed. On the
  one hand, there is the example of some young Churches, which show how fervently Sunday can
  be celebrated, whether in urban areas or in widely scattered villages. By contrast, in
  other parts of the world, because of the sociological pressures already noted, and perhaps
  because the motivation of faith is weak, the percentage of those attending the Sunday
  liturgy is strikingly low. In the minds of many of the faithful, not only the sense of the
  centrality of the Eucharist but even the sense of the duty to give thanks to the Lord and
  to pray to him with others in the community of the Church, seems to be diminishing. </p>
  <p>It is also true that both in mission countries and in countries evangelized long ago
  the lack of priests is such that the celebration of the Sunday Eucharist cannot always be
  guaranteed in every community. </p>
  <p><a name="s6"></a>6. Given this array of new situations and the questions which they
  prompt, it seems more necessary than ever <i>to recover the deep doctrinal foundations</i>
  underlying the Church's precept, so that the abiding value of Sunday in the Christian life
  will be clear to all the faithful. In doing this, we follow in the footsteps of the
  age-old tradition of the Church, powerfully restated by the Second Vatican Council in its
  teaching that on Sunday &quot;Christian believers should come together, in order to
  commemorate the suffering, Resurrection and glory of the Lord Jesus, by hearing God's Word
  and sharing the Eucharist, and to give thanks to God who has given them new birth to a
  living hope through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (cf. <i>1 Pt</i>
  1:3)&quot;.(<a HREF="#8">8</a>)<a name="8b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s7"></a>7. The duty to keep Sunday holy, especially by sharing in the
  Eucharist and by relaxing in a spirit of Christian joy and fraternity, is easily
  understood if we consider the many different aspects of this day upon which the present
  Letter will focus our attention. </p>
  <p align="left">Sunday is a day which is at the very heart of the Christian life. From the
  beginning of my Pontificate, I have not ceased to repeat: &quot;Do not be afraid! Open,
  open wide the doors to Christ!&quot;.(<a HREF="#9">9</a>)<a name="9b"></a> In the same
  way, today I would strongly urge everyone to rediscover Sunday: <i>Do not be afraid to
  give your time to Christ!</i> Yes, let us open our time to Christ, that he may cast light
  upon it and give it direction. He is the One who knows the secret of time and the secret
  of eternity, and he gives us &quot;his day&quot; as an ever new gift of his love. The
  rediscovery of this day is a grace which we must implore, not only so that we may live the
  demands of faith to the full, but also so that we may respond concretely to the deepest
  human yearnings. Time given to Christ is never time lost, but is rather time gained, so
  that our relationships and indeed our whole life may become more profoundly human. </p>

  &nbsp; CHAPTER I</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp; <br>
  <b><i>DIES DOMINI</i></b> &nbsp; <br>
  <b>The Celebration of the Creator's Work</b> </p>
  <p><a name="1-1"></a>&quot;<b><i>Through him all things were made</i></b>&quot; (<i>Jn</i>
  1:3) </p>
  <p><a name="s8"></a>8. For the Christian, Sunday is above all an Easter celebration,
  wholly illumined by the glory of the Risen Christ. It is the festival of the &quot;new
  creation&quot;. Yet, when understood in depth, this aspect is inseparable from what the
  first pages of Scripture tell us of the plan of God in the creation of the world. It is
  true that the Word was made flesh in &quot;the fullness of time&quot; (<i>Gal</i> 4:4);
  but it is also true that, in virtue of the mystery of his identity as the eternal Son of
  the Father, he is the origin and end of the universe. As John writes in the Prologue of
  his Gospel: &quot;Through him all things were made, and without him was made nothing that
  was made&quot; (1:3). Paul too stresses this in writing to the Colossians: &quot;In him
  all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible .... All things
  were created through him and for him&quot; (1:16). This active presence of the Son in the
  creative work of God is revealed fully in the Paschal Mystery, in which Christ, rising as
  &quot;the first fruits of those who had fallen asleep&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i> 15:20),
  established the new creation and began the process which he himself will bring to
  completion when he returns in glory to &quot;deliver the kingdom to God the Father ..., so
  that God may be everything to everyone&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i> 15:24,28). </p>
  <p>Already at the dawn of creation, therefore, the plan of God implied Christ's
  &quot;cosmic mission&quot;. This <i>Christocentric perspective</i>, embracing the whole
  arc of time, filled God's well-pleased gaze when, ceasing from all his work, he
  &quot;blessed the seventh day and made it holy&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 2:3). According to the
  Priestly writer of the first biblical creation story, then was born the
  &quot;Sabbath&quot;, so characteristic of the first Covenant, and which in some ways
  foretells the sacred day of the new and final Covenant. The theme of &quot;God's
  rest&quot; (cf. <i>Gn</i> 2:2) and the rest which he offered to the people of the Exodus
  when they entered the Promised Land (cf. <i>Ex</i> 33:14; <i>Dt</i> 3:20; 12:9; <i>Jos</i>
  21:44; <i>Ps</i> 95:11) is re-read in the New Testament in the light of the definitive
  &quot;Sabbath rest&quot; (<i>Heb</i> 4:9) into which Christ himself has entered by his
  Resurrection. The People of God are called to enter into this same rest by persevering in
  Christ's example of filial obedience (cf. <i>Heb</i> 4:3-16). In order to grasp fully the
  meaning of Sunday, therefore, we must re-read the great story of creation and deepen our
  understanding of the theology of the &quot;Sabbath&quot;. </p>
  <p><a name="1-2"></a>&quot;<b><i>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth</i></b>&quot;
  (<i>Gn</i> 1:1) </p>
  <p><a name="s9"></a>9. The poetic style of the Genesis story conveys well the awe which
  people feel before the immensity of creation and the resulting sense of adoration of the
  One who brought all things into being from nothing. It is a story of intense religious
  significance, a hymn to the Creator of the universe, pointing to him as the only Lord in
  the face of recurring temptations to divinize the world itself. At the same time, it is a
  hymn to the goodness of creation, all fashioned by the mighty and merciful hand of God. </p>
  <p>&quot;God saw that it was good&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 1:10,12, etc.). Punctuating the story
  as it does, this refrain <i>sheds a positive light upon every element of the universe</i>
  and reveals the secret for a proper understanding of it and for its eventual regeneration:
  the world is good insofar as it remains tied to its origin and, after being disfigured by
  sin, it is again made good when, with the help of grace, it returns to the One who made
  it. It is clear that this process directly concerns not inanimate objects and animals but
  human beings, who have been endowed with the incomparable gift and risk of freedom.
  Immediately after the creation stories, the Bible highlights the dramatic contrast between
  the grandeur of man, created in the image and likeness of God, and the fall of man, which
  unleashes on the world the darkness of sin and death (cf. <i>Gn</i> 3). </p>
  <p><a name="s10"></a>10. Coming as it does from the hand of God, the cosmos bears the
  imprint of his goodness. It is a beautiful world, rightly moving us to admiration and
  delight, but also calling for cultivation and development. At the &quot;completion&quot;
  of God's work, the world is ready for human activity. &quot;On the seventh day God
  finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work
  which he had done&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 2:2). With this anthropomorphic image of God's
  &quot;work&quot;, the Bible not only gives us a glimpse of the mysterious relationship
  between the Creator and the created world, but also casts light upon the task of human
  beings in relation to the cosmos. The &quot;work&quot; of God is in some ways an example
  for man, called not only to inhabit the cosmos, but also to &quot;build&quot; it and thus
  become God's &quot;co-worker&quot;. As I wrote in my Encyclical <i>Laborem Exercens</i>,
  the first chapters of Genesis constitute in a sense the first &quot;gospel of work&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#10">10</a>)<a name="10b"></a> This is a truth which the Second Vatican Council also
  stressed: &quot;Created in God's image, man was commissioned to subdue the earth and all
  it contains, to rule the world in justice and holiness, and, recognizing God as the
  creator of all things, to refer himself and the totality of things to God so that with
  everything subject to God, the divine name would be glorified in all the earth&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#11">11</a>)<a name="11b"></a> </p>
  <p>The exhilarating advance of science, technology and culture in their various forms
  &#151; an ever more rapid and today even overwhelming development &#151; is the historical
  consequence of the mission by which God entrusts to man and woman the task and
  responsibility of filling the earth and subduing it by means of their work, in the
  observance of God's Law. </p>
  <p><a name="1-3"></a><b><i>&quot;Shabbat&quot;: the Creator's joyful rest</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s11"></a>11. If the first page of the Book of Genesis presents God's
  &quot;work&quot; as an example for man, the same is true of God's &quot;rest&quot;:
  &quot;On the seventh day God finished his work which he had done&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 2:2).
  Here too we find an anthropomorphism charged with a wealth of meaning. </p>
  <p>It would be banal to interpret God's &quot;rest&quot; as a kind of divine
  &quot;inactivity&quot;. By its nature, the creative act which founds the world is
  unceasing and God is always at work, as Jesus himself declares in speaking of the Sabbath
  precept: &quot;My Father is working still, and I am working&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 5:17). The
  divine rest of the seventh day does not allude to an inactive God, but emphasizes the
  fullness of what has been accomplished. It speaks, as it were, of God's lingering before
  the &quot;very good&quot; work (<i>Gn</i> 1:31) which his hand has wrought, in order to
  cast upon it <i>a gaze full of joyous delight</i>. This is a &quot;contemplative&quot;
  gaze which does not look to new accomplishments but enjoys the beauty of what has already
  been achieved. It is a gaze which God casts upon all things, but in a special way upon
  man, the crown of creation. It is a gaze which already discloses something of the nuptial
  shape of the relationship which God wants to establish with the creature made in his own
  image, by calling that creature to enter a pact of love. This is what God will gradually
  accomplish, in offering salvation to all humanity through the saving covenant made with
  Israel and fulfilled in Christ. It will be the Word Incarnate, through the eschatological
  gift of the Holy Spirit and the configuration of the Church as his Body and Bride, who
  will extend to all humanity the offer of mercy and the call of the Father's love. </p>
  <p><a name="s12"></a>12. In the Creator's plan, there is both a distinction and a close
  link between the order of creation and the order of salvation. This is emphasized in the
  Old Testament, when it links the &quot;<i>shabbat</i>&quot; commandment not only with
  God's mysterious &quot;rest&quot; after the days of creation (cf. <i>Ex</i> 20:8-11), but
  also with the salvation which he offers to Israel <i>in the liberation from the slavery of
  Egypt</i> (cf. <i>Dt</i> 5:12-15). The God who rests on the seventh day, rejoicing in his
  creation, is the same God who reveals his glory in liberating his children from Pharaoh's
  oppression. Adopting an image dear to the Prophets, one could say that in both cases <i>God
  reveals himself as the bridegroom before the bride</i> (cf. <i>Hos</i> 2:16-24; <i>Jer</i>
  2:2; <i>Is</i> 54:4-8). </p>
  <p>As certain elements of the same Jewish tradition suggest,(<a HREF="#12">12</a>)<a
  name="12b"></a> to reach the heart of the &quot;<i>shabbat</i>&quot;, of God's
  &quot;rest&quot;, we need to recognize in both the Old and the New Testament the nuptial
  intensity which marks the relationship between God and his people. Hosea, for instance,
  puts it thus in this marvelous passage: &quot;I will make for you a covenant on that day
  with the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the ground;
  and I will abolish the bow, the sword, and war from the land; and I will make you lie down
  in safety. And I will betroth you to me for ever; I will betroth you to me in
  righteousness and in justice, in steadfast love and in mercy. I will betroth you to me in
  faithfulness; and you shall know the Lord&quot; (2:18-20). </p>
  <p><a name="1-4"></a>&quot;<b><i>God blessed the seventh day and made it holy</i></b>&quot;
  (<i>Gn</i> 2:3) </p>
  <p><a name="s13"></a>13. The Sabbath precept, which in the first Covenant prepares for the
  Sunday of the new and eternal Covenant, is therefore rooted in the depths of God's plan.
  This is why, unlike many other precepts, it is set not within the context of strictly
  cultic stipulations but within the Decalogue, the &quot;ten words&quot; which represent
  the very pillars of the moral life inscribed on the human heart. In setting this
  commandment within the context of the basic structure of ethics, Israel and then the
  Church declare that they consider it not just a matter of community religious discipline
  but <i>a defining and indelible expression of our relationship with God</i>, announced and
  expounded by biblical revelation. This is the perspective within which Christians need to
  rediscover this precept today. Although the precept may merge naturally with the human
  need for rest, it is faith alone which gives access to its deeper meaning and ensures that
  it will not become banal and trivialized. </p>
  <p><a name="s14"></a>14. In the first place, therefore, <u><font color="#FF0000">Sunday</font></u>
  is the day of rest because it is the day &quot;blessed&quot; by God and &quot;made
  holy&quot; by him, set apart from the other days to be, among all of them, &quot;the
  Lord's Day&quot;. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>[</strong>The above sentence is <strong><em>mistranslated</em></strong>
    from the Latin. It should read:</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">14. In the first place, therefore, the <strong>day of rest</strong>
    (the Sabbath) is such because it is the day &quot;blessed&quot; by God and &quot;made
    holy&quot; by him, set apart from the other days to be, among all of them, &quot;the
    Lord's Day&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">The Latin text reads as follows (Sunday in Latin is
    &quot;Dominica&quot;):</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">14. <strong>Quietis</strong> itaque <strong>dies</strong> idcirco
    ante omnia talis est quod dies est a Deo « benedictus » ab Eoque «<br>
    sanctificatus » scilicet ab aliis diebus segregatus ut inter omnes « dies sit Domini ».<strong>]</strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In order to grasp fully what the first of the biblical creation accounts means by
  keeping the Sabbath &quot;holy&quot;, we need to consider the whole story, which shows
  clearly how every reality, without exception, must be referred back to God. Time and space
  belong to him. He is not the God of one day alone, but the God of all the days of
  humanity. </p>
  <p>Therefore, if God &quot;sanctifies&quot; the seventh day with a special blessing and
  makes it &quot;his day&quot; <i>par excellence</i>, this must be understood within the
  deep dynamic of the dialogue of the Covenant, indeed the dialogue of &quot;marriage&quot;.
  This is the dialogue of love which knows no interruption, yet is never monotonous. In
  fact, it employs the different registers of love, from the ordinary and indirect to those
  more intense, which the words of Scripture and the witness of so many mystics do not
  hesitate to describe in imagery drawn from the experience of married love. </p>
  <p><a name="s15"></a>15. All human life, and therefore all human time, must become praise
  of the Creator and thanksgiving to him. But man's relationship with God also <i>demands
  times of explicit prayer</i>, in which the relationship becomes an intense dialogue,
  involving every dimension of the person. &quot;The Lord's Day&quot; is the day of this
  relationship <i>par excellence</i> when men and women raise their song to God and become
  the voice of all creation. </p>
  <p>This is precisely why it is also <i>the day of rest</i>. Speaking vividly as it does of
  &quot;renewal&quot; and &quot;detachment&quot;, the interruption of the often oppressive
  rhythm of work expresses the dependence of man and the cosmos upon God. <i>Everything
  belongs to God!</i> The Lord's Day returns again and again to declare this principle
  within the weekly reckoning of time. The &quot;Sabbath&quot; has therefore been
  interpreted evocatively as a determining element in the kind of &quot;sacred
  architecture&quot; of time which marks biblical revelation.(<a HREF="#13">13</a>)<a
  name="13b"></a> It recalls that <i>the universe and history belong to God</i>; and without
  a constant awareness of that truth, man cannot serve in the world as co-worker of the
  Creator. </p>
  <p><a name="1-5"></a><b><i>To &quot;keep holy&quot; by &quot;remembering&quot;</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s16"></a>16. The commandment of the Decalogue by which God decrees the Sabbath
  observance is formulated in the Book of Exodus in a distinctive way: &quot;Remember the
  Sabbath day in order to keep it holy&quot; (20:8). And the inspired text goes on to give
  the reason for this, recalling as it does the work of God: &quot;For in six days the Lord
  made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day;
  therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy&quot; (v. 11). Before
  decreeing that something be <i>done</i>, the commandment urges that something be <i>remembered</i>.
  It is a call to awaken remembrance of the grand and fundamental work of God which is
  creation, a remembrance which must inspire the entire religious life of man and then fill
  the day on which man is called to <i>rest</i>. Rest therefore acquires a sacred value: the
  faithful are called to rest not only <i>as</i> God rested, but to rest <i>in</i> the Lord,
  bringing the entire creation to him, in praise and thanksgiving, intimate as a child and
  friendly as a spouse. </p>
  <p><a name="s17"></a>17. The connection between Sabbath rest and the theme of
  &quot;remembering&quot; God's wonders is found also in the Book of Deuteronomy (5:12-15),
  where the precept is grounded less in the work of creation than in the work of liberation
  accomplished by God in the Exodus: &quot;You shall remember that you were a slave in the
  land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with mighty hand and
  outstretched arm; therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day&quot;
  (<i>Dt</i> 5:15). </p>
  <p>This formulation complements the one we have already seen; and taken together, the two
  reveal the meaning of &quot;the Lord's Day&quot; within a single theological vision which
  fuses creation and salvation. Therefore, the main point of the precept is not just any
  kind of <i>interruption</i> of work, but the <i>celebration</i> of the marvels which God
  has wrought. </p>
  <p>Insofar as this &quot;remembrance&quot; is alive, <i>full of thanksgiving and of the
  praise of God</i>, human rest on the Lord's Day takes on its full meaning. It is then that
  man enters the depths of God's &quot;rest&quot; and can experience a tremor of the
  Creator's joy when, after the creation, he saw that all he had made &quot;was very
  good&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 1:31). </p>
  <p><a name="1-6"></a><b><i>From the Sabbath to Sunday</i></b> </p>
  <p align="left"><a name="s18"></a>18. Because the Third Commandment depends upon the
  remembrance of God's saving works and because Christians saw the definitive time
  inaugurated by Christ as a new beginning, they made the first day after the Sabbath a
  festive day, for that was the day on which the Lord rose from the dead. The Paschal
  Mystery of Christ is the full revelation of the mystery of the world's origin, the climax
  of the history of salvation and the anticipation of the eschatological fulfilment of the
  world. What God accomplished in Creation and wrought for his People in the Exodus has
  found its fullest expression in Christ's Death and Resurrection, though its definitive
  fulfilment will not come until the <i>Parousia</i>, when Christ returns in glory. In him,
  the &quot;spiritual&quot; meaning of the Sabbath is fully realized, as Saint Gregory the
  Great declares: &quot;For us, the true Sabbath is the person of our Redeemer, our Lord
  Jesus Christ&quot;.(<a HREF="#14">14</a>)<a name="14b"></a> This is why the joy with which
  God, on humanity's first Sabbath, contemplates all that was created from nothing, is now
  expressed in the joy with which Christ, on Easter Sunday, appeared to his disciples,
  bringing the gift of peace and the gift of the Spirit (cf. <i>Jn</i> 20:19-23). It was in
  the Paschal Mystery that humanity, and with it the whole creation, &quot;groaning in
  birth-pangs until now&quot; (<i>Rom</i> 8:22), came to know its new &quot;exodus&quot;
  into the freedom of God's children who can cry out with Christ, &quot;Abba, Father!&quot;
  (<i>Rom</i> 8:15; <i>Gal</i> 4:6). In the light of this mystery, the meaning of the Old
  Testament precept concerning the Lord's Day is recovered, perfected and fully revealed in
  the glory which shines on the face of the Risen Christ (cf. <i>2 Cor</i> 4:6). We move
  from the &quot;Sabbath&quot; to the &quot;first day after the Sabbath&quot;, from the
  seventh day to the first day: the <i>dies Domini</i> becomes the <i>dies Christi</i>! </p>

  <b>The Day of the Risen Lord</b> <b>and of the Gift</b> <b>of the Holy Spirit</b> </p>
  <p><a name="2-1"></a><b><i>The weekly Easter</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s19"></a>19. &quot;We celebrate Sunday because of the venerable Resurrection
  of our Lord Jesus Christ, and we do so not only at Easter but also at each turning of the
  week&quot;: so wrote Pope Innocent I at the beginning of the fifth century,(<a HREF="#15">15</a>)<a
  name="15b"></a> testifying to an already well established practice which had evolved from
  the early years after the Lord's Resurrection. Saint Basil speaks of &quot;holy Sunday,
  honoured by the Lord's Resurrection, the first fruits of all the other days&quot;;(<a
  HREF="#16">16</a>)<a name="16b"></a> and Saint Augustine calls Sunday &quot;a sacrament of
  Easter&quot;.(<a HREF="#17">17</a>)<a name="17b"></a> </p>
  <p>The intimate bond between Sunday and the Resurrection of the Lord is strongly
  emphasized by all the Churches of East and West. In the tradition of the Eastern Churches
  in particular, every Sunday is the <i>anastàsimos hemèra</i>, the day of Resurrection,(<a
  HREF="#18">18</a>)<a name="18b"></a> and this is why it stands at the heart of all
  worship. </p>
  <p>In the light of this constant and universal tradition, it is clear that, although the
  Lord's Day is rooted in the very work of creation and even more in the mystery of the
  biblical &quot;rest&quot; of God, it is nonetheless to the Resurrection of Christ that we
  must look in order to understand fully the Lord's Day. This is what the Christian Sunday
  does, leading the faithful each week to ponder and live the event of Easter, true source
  of the world's salvation. </p>
  <p><a name="s20"></a>20. According to the common witness of the Gospels, the Resurrection
  of Jesus Christ from the dead took place on &quot;the first day after the Sabbath&quot; (<i>Mk</i>
  16:2,9; <i>Lk</i> 24:1; <i>Jn</i> 20:1). On the same day, the Risen Lord appeared to the
  two disciples of Emmaus (cf. <i>Lk</i> 24:13-35) and to the eleven Apostles gathered
  together (cf. <i>Lk</i> 24:36; <i>Jn</i> 20:19). A week later &#151; as the Gospel of John
  recounts (cf. 20:26) &#151; the disciples were gathered together once again, when Jesus
  appeared to them and made himself known to Thomas by showing him the signs of his Passion.
  The day of Pentecost &#151; the first day of the eighth week after the Jewish Passover
  (cf. <i>Acts</i> 2:1), when the promise made by Jesus to the Apostles after the
  Resurrection was fulfilled by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (cf. <i>Lk</i> 24:49; <i>Acts</i>
  1:4-5) &#151; also fell on a <u><font color="#FF0000">Sunday. This was the day</font></u>
  of the first proclamation and the first baptisms: Peter announced to the assembled crowd
  that Christ was risen and &quot;those who received his word were baptized&quot; (<i>Acts</i>
  2:41). This was the epiphany of the Church, revealed as the <u><font color="#FF0000">people
  </font></u><font color="#000000">into which</font><u><font color="#FF0000"> are gathered
  in unity, beyond all their differences,</font></u> the scattered children of God. </p>
  <p><a name="2-2"></a><b><i>The first day of the week</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s21"></a>21. It was for this reason that, from Apostolic times, &quot;the
  first day after the Sabbath&quot;, the first day of the week, began to shape the rhythm of
  life for Christ's disciples (cf. <i>1 Cor</i> 16:2). &quot;The first day after the
  Sabbath&quot; was also the day upon which the faithful of Troas were gathered &quot;for
  the breaking of bread&quot;, when Paul bade them farewell and miraculously restored the
  young Eutychus to life (cf. <i>Acts</i> 20:7-12). The Book of Revelation gives evidence of
  the practice of calling the first day of the week &quot;the Lord's Day&quot; (1:10). This
  would now be a characteristic distinguishing Christians from the world around them. As
  early as the beginning of the second century, it was noted by Pliny the Younger, governor
  of Bithynia, in his report on the Christian practice &quot;of gathering together on a set
  day before sunrise and singing among themselves a hymn to Christ as to a god&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#19">19</a>)<a name="19b"></a> And when Christians spoke of the &quot;Lord's
  Day&quot;, they did so giving to this term the full sense of the Easter proclamation:
  &quot;Jesus Christ is Lord&quot; (<i>Phil</i> 2:11; cf. <i>Acts</i> 2:36; <i>1 Cor</i>
  12:3). Thus Christ was given the same title which the Septuagint used to translate what in
  the revelation of the Old Testament was the unutterable name of God: YHWH. </p>
  <p><a name="s22"></a>22. In those early Christian times, the weekly rhythm of days was
  generally not part of life in the regions where the Gospel spread, and the festive days of
  the Greek and Roman calendars did not coincide with the Christian Sunday. For Christians,
  therefore, it was very difficult to observe the Lord's Day on a set day each week. This
  explains why the faithful had to gather before sunrise.(<a HREF="#20">20</a>)<a name="20b"></a>
  Yet fidelity to the weekly rhythm became the norm, since it was based upon the New
  Testament and was tied to Old Testament revelation. This is eagerly underscored by the
  Apologists and the Fathers of the Church in their writings and preaching where, in
  speaking of the Paschal Mystery, they use the same Scriptural texts which, according to
  the witness of Saint Luke (cf. 24:27, 44-47), the Risen Christ himself would have
  explained to the disciples. In the light of these texts, the celebration of the day of the
  Resurrection acquired a doctrinal and symbolic value capable of expressing the entire
  Christian mystery in all its newness. </p>
  <p><a name="2-3"></a><b><i>Growing distinction from the Sabbath</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s23"></a>23. It was this newness which the catechesis of the first centuries
  stressed as it sought to show the prominence of Sunday relative to the Jewish Sabbath. It
  was on the Sabbath that the Jewish people had to gather in the synagogue and to rest in
  the way prescribed by the Law. The Apostles, and in particular Saint Paul, continued
  initially to attend the synagogue so that there they might proclaim Jesus Christ,
  commenting upon &quot;the words of the prophets which are read every Sabbath&quot; (<i>Acts</i>
  13:27). Some communities observed the Sabbath while also celebrating Sunday. Soon,
  however, the two days began to be distinguished ever more clearly, in reaction chiefly to
  the insistence of those Christians whose origins in Judaism made them inclined to maintain
  the obligation of the old Law. Saint Ignatius of Antioch writes: &quot;If those who were
  living in the former state of things have come to a new hope, no longer observing the
  Sabbath but keeping <u><font color="#FF0000">the Lord's Day</font></u>, the day on which
  our life has appeared through him and his death ..., that mystery from which we have
  received our faith and in which we persevere in order to be judged disciples of Christ,
  our only Master, how could we then live without him, given that the prophets too, as his
  disciples in the Spirit, awaited him as master?&quot;.(<a HREF="#21">21</a>)<a name="21b"></a>
  Saint Augustine notes in turn: <u><font color="#FF0000">&quot;Therefore the Lord too has
  placed his seal on his day</font></u>, which is <u><font color="#FF0000">the third after
  the Passion</font></u>. In the weekly cycle, however, it is the eighth day after the
  seventh, that is after the Sabbath, and the first day of the week&quot;.(<a HREF="#22">22</a>)<a
  name="22b"></a> The distinction of Sunday from the Jewish Sabbath grew ever stronger in
  the mind of the Church, even though there have been times in history when, because the
  obligation of Sunday rest was so emphasized, the Lord's Day tended to become more like the
  Sabbath. Moreover, there have always been groups within Christianity which observe both
  the Sabbath and Sunday as &quot;two brother days&quot;.(<a HREF="#23">23</a>)<a name="23b"></a>
  </p>
  <p><a name="2-4"></a><b><i>The day of the new creation</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s24"></a>24. A comparison of the Christian Sunday with the Old Testament
  vision of the Sabbath prompted theological insights of great interest. In particular,
  there emerged the unique connection between the Resurrection and Creation. Christian
  thought spontaneously linked the Resurrection, which took place on &quot;the first day of
  the week&quot;, with the first day of that cosmic week (cf. <i>Gn</i> 1:1 - 2:4) which
  shapes the creation story in the Book of Genesis: the day of the creation of light (cf.
  1:3-5). This link invited an understanding of the Resurrection as the beginning of a new
  creation, the first fruits of which is the glorious Christ, &quot;the first born of all
  creation&quot; (<i>Col</i> 1:15) and &quot;the first born from the dead&quot; (<i>Col</i>
  1:18). </p>
  <p><a name="s25"></a>25. In effect, Sunday is the day above all other days which summons
  Christians to remember the salvation which was given to them in baptism and which has made
  them new in Christ. &quot;You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also
  raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead&quot; (<i>Col</i>
  2:12; cf. <i>Rom</i> 6:4-6). The liturgy underscores this baptismal dimension of Sunday,
  both in calling for the celebration of baptisms &#151; as well as at the Easter Vigil
  &#151; on the day of the week &quot;when the Church commemorates the Lord's
  Resurrection&quot;,(<a HREF="#24">24</a>)<a name="24b"></a> and in suggesting as an
  appropriate penitential rite at the start of Mass the sprinkling of holy water, which
  recalls the moment of Baptism in which all Christian life is born.(<a HREF="#25">25</a>)<a
  name="25b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="2-5"></a><b><i>The eighth day: image of eternity</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s26"></a>26. By contrast, the Sabbath's position as the seventh day of the
  week suggests for the Lord's Day a complementary symbolism, much loved by the Fathers.
  Sunday is not only the first day, it is also &quot;the eighth day&quot;, set within the
  sevenfold succession of days in a unique and transcendent position which evokes not only
  the beginning of time but also its end in &quot;the age to come&quot;. Saint Basil
  explains that Sunday symbolizes that truly singular day which will follow the present
  time, the day without end which will know neither evening nor morning, the imperishable
  age which will never grow old; Sunday is the ceaseless foretelling of life without end
  which renews the hope of Christians and encourages them on their way.(<a HREF="#26">26</a>)<a
  name="26b"></a> Looking towards the last day, which fulfils completely the eschatological
  symbolism of the Sabbath, Saint Augustine concludes the Confessions describing the <i>Eschaton</i>
  as &quot;the peace of quietness, the peace of the Sabbath, a peace with no evening&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#27">27</a>)<a name="27b"></a> In celebrating Sunday, both the &quot;first&quot; and
  the &quot;eighth&quot; day, the Christian is led towards the goal of eternal life.(<a
  HREF="#28">28</a>)<a name="28b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="2-6"></a><b><i>The day of Christ-Light</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s27"></a>27. This Christocentric vision sheds light upon another symbolism
  which Christian reflection and pastoral practice ascribed to the Lord's Day. <u><font
  color="#FF0000">Wise pastoral intuition suggested to the Church the christianization of
  the notion of Sunday as &quot;the day of the sun&quot;, which was the Roman name for the
  day and which is retained in some modern languages.</font></u>(<a HREF="#29">29</a>)<a
  name="29b"></a> <u><font color="#FF0000">This was in order to draw the faithful away from
  the seduction of cults which worshipped the sun, and to direct the celebration of the day
  to Christ, humanity's true &quot;sun&quot;.</font></u> Writing to the pagans, Saint Justin
  uses the language of the time to note that Christians gather together &quot;on the day
  named after the sun&quot;,(<a HREF="#30">30</a>)<a name="30b"></a> but for believers the
  expression had already assumed a new meaning which was unmistakably rooted in the Gospel.(<a
  HREF="#31">31</a>)<a name="31b"></a> Christ is the light of the world (cf. <i>Jn</i> 9:5;
  also 1:4-5, 9), and, in the weekly reckoning of time, the day commemorating his
  Resurrection is the enduring reflection of the epiphany of his glory. The theme of Sunday
  as the day illuminated by the triumph of the Risen Christ is also found in the Liturgy of
  the Hours(<a HREF="#32">32</a>)<a name="32b"></a> and is given special emphasis in the <i>Pannichida</i>,
  the vigil which in the Eastern liturgies prepares for Sunday. From generation to
  generation as she gathers on this day, the Church makes her own the wonderment of
  Zechariah as he looked upon Christ, seeing in him the dawn which gives &quot;light to
  those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death&quot; (<i>Lk</i> 1:78-79), and she
  echoes the joy of Simeon when he takes in his arms the divine Child who has come as the
  &quot;light to enlighten the Gentiles&quot; (<i>Lk</i> 2:32). </p>
  <p><a name="2-7"></a><b><i>The day of the gift of the Spirit</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s28"></a>28. Sunday, the day of light, could also be called the day of
  &quot;fire&quot;, in reference to the Holy Spirit. The light of Christ is intimately
  linked to the &quot;fire&quot; of the Spirit, and the two images together reveal the
  meaning of the Christian Sunday.(<a HREF="#33">33</a>)<a name="33b"></a> When he appeared
  to the Apostles on the evening of Easter, Jesus breathed upon them and said: &quot;Receive
  the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins
  of any, they are retained&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 20:22-23). The outpouring of the Spirit was the
  great gift of the Risen Lord to his disciples on Easter Sunday. It was again Sunday when,
  fifty days after the Resurrection, the Spirit descended in power, as &quot;a mighty
  wind&quot; and &quot;fire&quot; (<i>Acts</i> 2:2-3), upon the Apostles gathered with Mary.
  Pentecost is not only the founding event of the Church, but is also the mystery which for
  ever gives life to the Church.(<a HREF="#34">34</a>)<a name="34b"></a> Such an event has
  its own powerful liturgical moment in the annual celebration which concludes &quot;the
  great Sunday&quot;,(<a HREF="#35">35</a>)<a name="35b"></a> but it also remains a part of
  the deep meaning of every Sunday, because of its intimate bond with the Paschal Mystery.
  The &quot;weekly Easter&quot; thus becomes, in a sense, the &quot;weekly Pentecost&quot;,
  when Christians relive the Apostles' joyful encounter with the Risen Lord and receive the
  life-giving breath of his Spirit. </p>
  <p><a name="2-8"></a><b><i>The day of faith</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s29"></a>29. Given these different dimensions which set it apart, Sunday
  appears as the supreme <i>day of faith</i>. It is the day when, by the power of the Holy
  Spirit, who is the Church's living &quot;memory&quot; (cf. <i>Jn</i> 14:26), the first
  appearance of the Risen Lord becomes an event renewed in the &quot;today&quot; of each of
  Christ's disciples. Gathered in his presence in the Sunday assembly, believers sense
  themselves called like the Apostle Thomas: &quot;Put your finger here, and see my hands.
  Put out your hand, and place it in my side. Doubt no longer, but believe&quot; (<i>Jn</i>
  20:27). Yes, Sunday is the day of faith. This is stressed by the fact that the Sunday
  Eucharistic liturgy, like the liturgy of other solemnities, includes the Profession of
  Faith. Recited or sung, the Creed declares the baptismal and Paschal character of Sunday,
  making it the day on which in a special way the baptized renew their adherence to Christ
  and his Gospel in a rekindled awareness of their baptismal promises. Listening to the word
  and receiving the Body of the Lord, the baptized contemplate the Risen Jesus present in
  the &quot;holy signs&quot; and confess with the Apostle Thomas: &quot;My Lord and my
  God!&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 20:28). </p>
  <p><a name="2-9"></a><b><i>An indispensable day!</i></b> </p>
  <p align="left"><a name="s30"></a>30. It is clear then why, even in our own difficult
  times, the identity of this day must be protected and above all must be lived in all its
  depth. An Eastern writer of the beginning of the third century recounts that as early as
  then the faithful in every region were keeping Sunday holy on a regular basis.(<a
  HREF="#36">36</a>)<a name="36b"></a> <u><font color="#FF0000">What began as a spontaneous
  practice later became a juridically sanctioned norm.</font></u> The Lord's Day has
  structured the history of the Church through two thousand years: how could we think that
  it will not continue to shape her future? The pressures of today can make it harder to
  fulfil the Sunday obligation; and, with a mother's sensitivity, the Church looks to the
  circumstances of each of her children. In particular, she feels herself called to a new
  catechetical and pastoral commitment, in order to ensure that, in the normal course of
  life, none of her children are deprived of the rich outpouring of grace which the
  celebration of the Lord's Day brings. It was in this spirit that the Second Vatican
  Council, making a pronouncement on the possibility of reforming the Church calendar to
  match different civil calendars, declared that the Church &quot;is prepared to accept only
  those arrangements which preserve a week of seven days with a Sunday&quot;.(<a HREF="#37">37</a>)<a
  name="37b"></a> Given its many meanings and aspects, and its link to the very foundations
  of the faith, the celebration of the Christian Sunday remains, on the threshold of the
  Third Millennium, an indispensable element of our Christian identity. </p>

  &nbsp;CHAPTER III &nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center"><b><i>DIES ECCLESIAE</i></b> &nbsp; <br>
  <b>The Eucharistic Assembly:</b> <b>Heart of Sunday</b> </p>
  <p><a name="3-1"></a><b><i>The presence of the Risen Lord</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s31"></a>31. &quot;I am with you always, to the end of the age&quot; (<i>Mt</i>
  28:20). This promise of Christ never ceases to resound in the Church as the fertile secret
  of her life and the wellspring of her hope. As the day of Resurrection, Sunday is not only
  the remembrance of a past event: it is a celebration of the living presence of the Risen
  Lord in the midst of his own people. </p>
  <p>For this presence to be properly proclaimed and lived, it is not enough that the
  disciples of Christ pray individually and commemorate the death and Resurrection of Christ
  inwardly, in the secrecy of their hearts. Those who have received the grace of baptism are
  not saved as individuals alone, but as members of the Mystical Body, having become part of
  the People of God.(<a HREF="#38">38</a>)<a name="38b"></a> It is important therefore that
  they come together to express fully the very identity of the Church, the <i>ekklesia</i>,
  the assembly called together by the Risen Lord who offered his life &quot;to reunite the
  scattered children of God&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 11:52). They have become &quot;one&quot; in
  Christ (cf. <i>Gal</i> 3:28) through the gift of the Spirit. This unity becomes visible
  when Christians gather together: it is then that they come to know vividly and to testify
  to the world that they are the people redeemed, drawn &quot;from every tribe and language
  and people and nation&quot; (<i>Rev</i> 5:9). The assembly of Christ's disciples embodies
  from age to age the image of the first Christian community which Luke gives as an example
  in the Acts of the Apostles, when he recounts that the first baptized believers
  &quot;devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of
  bread and the prayers&quot; (2:42). </p>
  <p><a name="3-2"></a><b><i>The Eucharistic assembly</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s32"></a>32. The Eucharist is not only a particularly intense expression of
  the reality of the Church's life, but also in a sense its &quot;fountain-head&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#39">39</a>)<a name="39b"></a> The Eucharist feeds and forms the Church:
  &quot;Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the
  one bread&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i> 10:17). Because of this vital link with the sacrament of the
  Body and Blood of the Lord, the mystery of the Church is savoured, proclaimed, and lived
  supremely in the Eucharist.(<a HREF="#40">40</a>)<a name="40b"></a> </p>
  <p>This ecclesial dimension intrinsic to the Eucharist is realized in every Eucharistic
  celebration. But it is expressed most especially on the day when the whole community comes
  together to commemorate the Lord's Resurrection. Significantly, the Catechism of the
  Catholic Church teaches that &quot;the Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his
  Eucharist is at the heart of the Church's life&quot;.(<a HREF="#41">41</a>)<a name="41b"></a>
  </p>
  <p><a name="s33"></a>33. At Sunday Mass, Christians relive with particular intensity the
  experience of the Apostles on the evening of Easter when the Risen Lord appeared to them
  as they were gathered together (cf. <i>Jn</i> 20:19). In a sense, the People of God of all
  times were present in that small nucleus of disciples, the first fruits of the Church.
  Through their testimony, every generation of believers hears the greeting of Christ, rich
  with the messianic gift of peace, won by his blood and offered with his Spirit:
  &quot;Peace be with you!&quot; Christ's return among them &quot;a week later&quot; (<i>Jn</i>
  20:26) can be seen as a radical prefiguring of the Christian community's practice of
  coming together every seven days, on &quot;the Lord's Day&quot; or Sunday, in order to
  profess faith in his Resurrection and to receive the blessing which he had promised:
  &quot;Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 20:29). This
  close connection between the appearance of the Risen Lord and the Eucharist is suggested
  in the Gospel of Luke in the story of the two disciples of Emmaus, whom Christ approached
  and led to understand the Scriptures and then sat with them at table. They recognized him
  when he &quot;took the bread, said the blessing, broke it and gave it to them&quot;
  (24:30). The gestures of Jesus in this account are his gestures at the Last Supper, with
  the clear allusion to the &quot;breaking of bread&quot;, as the Eucharist was called by
  the first generation of Christians. </p>
  <p><a name="3-3"></a><b><i>The Sunday Eucharist</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s34"></a>34. It is true that, in itself, the Sunday Eucharist is no different
  from the Eucharist celebrated on other days, nor can it be separated from liturgical and
  sacramental life as a whole. By its very nature, the Eucharist is an epiphany of the
  Church;(<a HREF="#42">42</a>)<a name="42b"></a> and this is most powerfully expressed when
  the diocesan community gathers in prayer with its Pastor: &quot;The Church appears with
  special clarity when the holy People of God, all of them, are actively and fully sharing
  in the same liturgical celebrations &#151; especially when it is the same Eucharist &#151;
  sharing one prayer at one altar, at which the Bishop is presiding, surrounded by his
  presbyters and his ministers&quot;.(<a HREF="#43">43</a>)<a name="43b"></a> This
  relationship with the Bishop and with the entire Church community is inherent in every
  Eucharistic celebration, even when the Bishop does not preside, regardless of the day of
  the week on which it is celebrated. The mention of the Bishop in the Eucharistic Prayer is
  the indication of this. </p>
  <p>But because of its special solemnity and <u><font color="#FF0000">the obligatory
  presence of the community</font></u>, and because it is celebrated &quot;on the day when
  Christ conquered death and gave us a share in his immortal life&quot;,(<a HREF="#44">44</a>)<a
  name="44b"></a> the Sunday Eucharist expresses with greater emphasis its inherent
  ecclesial dimension. It becomes the paradigm for other Eucharistic celebrations. Each
  community, gathering all its members for the &quot;breaking of the bread&quot;, becomes
  the place where the mystery of the Church is concretely made present. <u><font
  color="#FF0000">In celebrating the Eucharist, the community opens itself to communion with
  the universal Church,</font></u>(<a HREF="#45">45</a>)<a name="45b"></a> imploring the
  Father to &quot;remember the Church throughout the world&quot; <u><font color="#FF0000">and
  make her grow in the unity of all the faithful with the Pope</font></u> and with the
  Pastors of the particular Churches, until love is brought to perfection. </p>
  <p><a name="3-4"></a><b><i>The day of the Church</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s35"></a>35. Therefore, the <i>dies Domini</i> is also the <i>dies Ecclesiae</i>.
  This is why on the pastoral level the community aspect of the Sunday celebration should be
  particularly stressed. As I have noted elsewhere, among the many activities of a parish,
  &quot;none is as vital or as community-forming as the Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day
  and his Eucharist&quot;.(<a HREF="#46">46</a>)<a name="46b"></a> Mindful of this, the
  Second Vatican Council recalled that efforts must be made to ensure that there is
  &quot;within the parish, a lively sense of community, in the first place through the
  community celebration of Sunday Mass&quot;.(<a HREF="#47">47</a>)<a name="47b"></a>
  Subsequent liturgical directives made the same point, asking that on Sundays and holy days
  the Eucharistic celebrations held normally in other churches and chapels be coordinated
  with the celebration in the parish church, in order &quot;to foster the sense of the
  Church community, which is nourished and expressed in a particular way by the community
  celebration on Sunday, whether around the Bishop, especially in the Cathedral, or in the
  parish assembly, in which the pastor represents the Bishop&quot;.(<a HREF="#48">48</a>)<a
  name="48b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s36"></a>36. <u><font color="#FF0000">The Sunday assembly is the privileged
  place of unity: it is the setting for the celebration of the <i>sacramentum unitatis</i>
  which profoundly marks the Church</font></u> as a people gathered &quot;by&quot; and
  &quot;in&quot; the unity of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.(<a HREF="#49">49</a>)<a
  name="49b"></a> For Christian families, the Sunday assembly is one of the most outstanding
  expressions of their identity and their &quot;ministry&quot; as &quot;domestic
  churches&quot;,(<a HREF="#50">50</a>)<a name="50b"></a> when parents share with their
  children at the one Table of the word and of the Bread of Life. We do well to recall in
  this regard that it is first of all the parents who must teach their children to
  participate in Sunday Mass; they are assisted in this by catechists, who are to see to it
  that initiation into the Mass is made a part of the formation imparted to the children
  entrusted to their care, explaining the important reasons behind the obligatory nature of
  the precept. When circumstances suggest it, the celebration of Masses for Children, in
  keeping with the provisions of the liturgical norms,(<a HREF="#51">51</a>)<a name="51b"></a>
  can also help in this regard. </p>
  <p>At Sunday Masses in parishes, insofar as parishes are &quot;Eucharistic
  communities&quot;,(<a HREF="#52">52</a>)<a name="52b"></a> it is normal to find different
  groups, movements, associations and even the smaller religious communities present in the
  parish. This allows everyone to experience in common what they share most deeply, beyond
  the particular spiritual paths which, by discernment of Church authority,(<a HREF="#53">53</a>)<a
  name="53b"></a> legitimately distinguish them. This is why on Sunday, the day of
  gathering, small group Masses are not to be encouraged: it is not only a question of
  ensuring that parish assemblies are not without the necessary ministry of priests, but
  also of ensuring that the life and unity of the Church community are fully safeguarded and
  promoted.(<a HREF="#54">54</a>)<a name="54b"></a> Authorization of possible and clearly
  restricted exceptions to this general guideline will depend upon the wise discernment of
  the Pastors of the particular Churches, in view of special needs in the area of formation
  and pastoral care, and keeping in mind the good of individuals or groups &#151; especially
  the benefits which such exceptions may bring to the entire Christian community. </p>
  <p><a name="3-5"></a><b><i>A pilgrim people</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s37"></a>37. As the Church journeys through time, the reference to Christ's
  Resurrection and the weekly recurrence of this solemn memorial help to remind us of <i>the
  pilgrim and eschatological character of the People of God</i>. Sunday after Sunday the
  Church moves towards the final &quot;Lord's Day&quot;, that Sunday which knows no end. The
  expectation of Christ's coming is inscribed in the very mystery of the Church(<a
  HREF="#55">55</a>)<a name="55b"></a> and is evidenced in every Eucharistic celebration.
  But, with its specific remembrance of the glory of the Risen Christ, the Lord's Day
  recalls with greater intensity the future glory of his &quot;return&quot;. This makes
  Sunday the day on which the Church, showing forth more clearly her identity as
  &quot;Bride&quot;, anticipates in some sense the eschatological reality of the heavenly
  Jerusalem. Gathering her children into the Eucharistic assembly and teaching them to wait
  for the &quot;divine Bridegroom&quot;, she engages in a kind of &quot;exercise of
  desire&quot;,(<a HREF="#56">56</a>)<a name="56b"></a> receiving a foretaste of the joy of
  the new heavens and new earth, when the holy city, the new Jerusalem, will come down from
  God, &quot;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&quot; (<i>Rev</i> 21:2). </p>
  <p><a name="3-6"></a><b><i>The day of hope</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s38"></a>38. Viewed in this way, Sunday is not only the day of faith, but is
  also <i>the day of Christian hope</i>. To share in &quot;the Lord's Supper&quot; is to
  anticipate the eschatological feast of the &quot;marriage of the Lamb&quot; (<i>Rev</i>
  19:9). Celebrating this memorial of Christ, risen and ascended into heaven, the Christian
  community waits &quot;in joyful hope for the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#57">57</a>)<a name="57b"></a> Renewed and nourished by this intense weekly rhythm,
  Christian hope becomes the leaven and the light of human hope. This is why the Prayer of
  the Faithful responds not only to the needs of the particular Christian community but also
  to those of all humanity; and the Church, coming together for the Eucharistic celebration,
  shows to the world that she makes her own &quot;the joys and hopes, the sorrows and
  anxieties of people today, especially of the poor and all those who suffer&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#58">58</a>)<a name="58b"></a> With the offering of the Sunday Eucharist, the Church
  crowns the witness which her children strive to offer every day of the week by proclaiming
  the Gospel and practising charity in the world of work and in all the many tasks of life;
  thus she shows forth more plainly her identity &quot;as a sacrament, or sign and
  instrument of intimate union with God and of the unity of the entire human race&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#59">59</a>)<a name="59b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="3-7"></a><b><i>The table of the word</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s39"></a>39. As in every Eucharistic celebration, the Risen Lord is
  encountered in the Sunday assembly at the twofold table of the word and of the Bread of
  Life. The table of the word offers the same understanding of the history of salvation and
  especially of the Paschal Mystery which the Risen Jesus himself gave to his disciples: it
  is Christ who speaks, present as he is in his word &quot;when Sacred Scripture is read in
  the Church&quot;.(<a HREF="#60">60</a>)<a name="60b"></a> At the table of the Bread of
  Life, the Risen Lord becomes really, substantially and enduringly present through the
  memorial of his Passion and Resurrection, and the Bread of Life is offered as a pledge of
  future glory. The Second Vatican Council recalled that &quot;the Liturgy of the Word and
  the Liturgy of the Eucharist are so closely joined together that they form a single act of
  worship&quot;.(<a HREF="#60">61</a>)<a name="61b"></a> The Council also urged that
  &quot;the table of the word of God be more lavishly prepared for the faithful, opening to
  them more abundantly the treasures of the Bible&quot;.(<a HREF="#62">62</a>)<a name="62b"></a>
  It then decreed that, in Masses of Sunday and holy days of obligation, the homily should
  not be omitted except for serious reasons.(<a HREF="#62">63</a>)<a name="63b"></a> These
  timely decrees were faithfully embodied in the liturgical reform, about which Paul VI
  wrote, commenting upon the richer offering of biblical readings on Sunday and holy days:
  &quot;All this has been decreed so as to foster more and more in the faithful 'that hunger
  for hearing the word of the Lord' (<i>Am</i> 8:11) which, under the guidance of the Holy
  Spirit, spurs the People of the New Covenant on towards the perfect unity of the
  Church&quot;.(<a HREF="#64">64</a>)<a name="64b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s40"></a>40. In considering the Sunday Eucharist more than thirty years after
  the Council, we need to assess how well the word of God is being proclaimed and how
  effectively the People of God have grown in knowledge and love of Sacred Scripture.(<a
  HREF="#65">65</a>)<a name="65b"></a> There are two aspects of this &#151; that of <i>celebration</i>
  and that of <i>personal appropriation</i> &#151; and they are very closely related. At the
  level of celebration, the fact that the Council made it possible to proclaim the word of
  God in the language of the community taking part in the celebration must awaken a new
  sense of responsibility towards the word, allowing &quot;the distinctive character of the
  sacred text&quot; to shine forth &quot;even in the mode of reading or singing&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#66">66</a>)<a name="66b"></a> At the level of personal appropriation, the hearing
  of the word of God proclaimed must be well prepared in the souls of the faithful by an apt
  knowledge of Scripture and, where pastorally possible, by <i>special initiatives designed
  to deepen understanding of the biblical readings</i>, particularly those used on Sundays
  and holy days. If Christian individuals and families are not regularly drawing new life
  from the reading of the sacred text in a spirit of prayer and docility to the Church's
  interpretation,(<a HREF="#67">67</a>)<a name="67b"></a> then it is difficult for the
  liturgical proclamation of the word of God alone to produce the fruit we might expect.
  This is the value of initiatives in parish communities which bring together during the
  week those who take part in the Eucharist &#151; priest, ministers and faithful(<a
  HREF="#68">68</a>)<a name="68b"></a> &#151; in order to prepare the Sunday liturgy,
  reflecting beforehand upon the word of God which will be proclaimed. The objective sought
  here is that the entire celebration &#151; praying, singing, listening, and not just the
  preaching &#151; should express in some way the theme of the Sunday liturgy, so that all
  those taking part may be penetrated more powerfully by it. Clearly, much depends on those
  who exercise the ministry of the word. It is their duty to prepare the reflection on the
  word of the Lord by prayer and study of the sacred text, so that they may then express its
  contents faithfully and apply them to people's concerns and to their daily lives. </p>
  <p><a name="s41"></a>41. It should also be borne in mind that <i>the liturgical
  proclamation of the word of God</i>, especially in the Eucharistic assembly, is not so
  much a time for meditation and catechesis as <i>a dialogue between God and his People</i>,
  a dialogue in which the wonders of salvation are proclaimed and the demands of the
  Covenant are continually restated. On their part, the People of God are drawn to respond
  to this dialogue of love by giving thanks and praise, also by demonstrating their fidelity
  to the task of continual &quot;conversion&quot;. The Sunday assembly commits us therefore
  to an inner renewal of our baptismal promises, which are in a sense implicit in the
  recitation of the Creed, and are an explicit part of the liturgy of the Easter Vigil and
  whenever Baptism is celebrated during Mass. In this context, the proclamation of the word
  in the Sunday Eucharistic celebration takes on the solemn tone found in the Old Testament
  at moments when the Covenant was renewed, when the Law was proclaimed and the community of
  Israel was called &#151; like the People in the desert at the foot of Sinai (cf. <i>Ex</i>
  19:7-8; 24:3,7) &#151; to repeats its &quot;yes&quot;, renewing its decision to be
  faithful to God and to obey his commandments. In speaking his word, God awaits our
  response: a response which Christ has already made for us with his &quot;Amen&quot; (cf. <i>2
  Cor</i> 1:20-22), and which echoes in us through the Holy Spirit so that what we hear may
  involve us at the deepest level.(<a HREF="#69">69</a>)<a name="69b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="3-8"></a><b><i>The table of the Body of Christ</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s42"></a>42. The table of the word leads naturally to the table of the
  Eucharistic Bread and prepares the community to live its many aspects, which in the Sunday
  Eucharist assume an especially solemn character. As the whole community gathers to
  celebrate &quot;the Lord's Day&quot;, the Eucharist appears more clearly than on other
  days as the great &quot;thanksgiving&quot; in which the Spirit-filled Church turns to the
  Father, becoming one with Christ and speaking in the name of all humanity. The rhythm of
  the week prompts us to gather up in grateful memory the events of the days which have just
  passed, to review them in the light of God and to thank him for his countless gifts,
  glorifying him &quot;through Christ, with Christ and in Christ, in the unity of the Holy
  Spirit&quot;. The Christian community thus comes to a renewed awareness of the fact that
  all things were created through Christ (cf. <i>Col</i> 1:16; <i>Jn</i> 1:3), and that in
  Christ, who came in the form of a slave to take on and redeem our human condition, all
  things have been restored (cf. <i>Eph</i> 1:10), in order to be handed over to God the
  Father, from whom all things come to be and draw their life. Then, giving assent to the
  Eucharistic doxology with their &quot;Amen&quot;, the People of God look in faith and hope
  towards the eschatological end, when Christ &quot;will deliver the kingdom to God the
  Father ... so that God may be everything to everyone&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i> 15:24, 28). </p>
  <p><a name="s43"></a>43. This &quot;ascending&quot; movement is inherent in every
  Eucharistic celebration and makes it a joyous event, overflowing with gratitude and hope.
  But it emerges particularly at Sunday Mass because of its special link with the
  commemoration of the Resurrection. By contrast, this &quot;Eucharistic&quot; rejoicing
  which &quot;lifts up our hearts&quot; is the fruit of God's &quot;descending&quot;
  movement towards us, which remains for ever etched in the essential sacrificial element of
  the Eucharist, the supreme expression and celebration of the mystery of the <i>kenosis</i>,
  the descent by which Christ &quot;humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even
  death on a Cross&quot; (<i>Phil</i> 2:8). </p>
  <p>The Mass in fact <i>truly makes present the sacrifice of the Cross</i>. Under the
  species of bread and wine, upon which has been invoked the outpouring of the Spirit who
  works with absolutely unique power in the words of consecration, Christ offers himself to
  the Father in the same act of sacrifice by which he offered himself on the Cross. &quot;In
  this divine sacrifice which is accomplished in the Mass, the same Christ who offered
  himself once and for all in a bloody manner on the altar of the Cross is contained and is
  offered in an unbloody manner&quot;.(<a HREF="#70">70</a>)<a name="70b"></a> To his
  sacrifice Christ unites the sacrifice of the Church: &quot;In the Eucharist the sacrifice
  of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the members of his Body. The lives of the
  faithful, their praise, sufferings, prayer and work, are united with those of Christ and
  with his total offering, and so acquire a new value&quot;.(<a HREF="#71">71</a>)<a
  name="71b"></a> The truth that the whole community shares in Christ's sacrifice is
  especially evident in the Sunday gathering, which makes it possible to bring to the altar
  the week that has passed, with all its human burdens. </p>
  <p><a name="3-9"></a><b><i>Easter banquet and fraternal gathering</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s44"></a>44. The communal character of the Eucharist emerges in a special way
  when it is seen as the Easter banquet, in which Christ himself becomes our nourishment. In
  fact, &quot;for this purpose Christ entrusted to the Church this sacrifice: so that the
  faithful might share in it, both spiritually, in faith and charity, and sacramentally, in
  the banquet of Holy Communion. Sharing in the Lord's Supper is always communion with
  Christ, who offers himself for us in sacrifice to the Father&quot;.(<a HREF="#72">72</a>)<a
  name="72b"></a> This is why the Church <i>recommends that the faithful receive communion
  when they take part in the Eucharist</i>, provided that they are properly disposed and, if
  aware of grave sin, have received God's pardon in the Sacrament of Reconciliation,(<a
  HREF="#73">73</a>)<a name="73b"></a> in the spirit of what Saint Paul writes to the
  community at Corinth (cf. <i>1 Cor</i> 11:27-32). Obviously, the invitation to Eucharistic
  communion is more insistent in the case of Mass on Sundays and holy days. </p>
  <p>It is also important to be ever mindful that communion with Christ is deeply tied to
  communion with our brothers and sisters. The Sunday Eucharistic gathering is <i>an
  experience of brotherhood</i>, which the celebration should demonstrate clearly, while
  ever respecting the nature of the liturgical action. All this will be helped by gestures
  of welcome and by the tone of prayer, alert to the needs of all in the community. The sign
  of peace &#151; in the Roman Rite significantly placed before Eucharistic communion &#151;
  is a particularly expressive gesture which the faithful are invited to make as a
  manifestation of the People of God's acceptance of all that has been accomplished in the
  celebration(<a HREF="#74">74</a>)<a name="74b"></a> and of the commitment to mutual love
  which is made in sharing the one bread, with the demanding words of Christ in mind:
  &quot;If you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has
  something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled
  with your brother, and then come and offer your gift&quot; (<i>Mt</i> 5:23-24). </p>
  <p><a name="3-10"></a><b><i>From Mass to &quot;mission&quot;</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s45"></a>45. Receiving the Bread of Life, the disciples of Christ ready
  themselves to undertake with the strength of the Risen Lord and his Spirit <i>the tasks
  which await them in their ordinary life</i>. For the faithful who have understood the
  meaning of what they have done, the Eucharistic celebration does not stop at the church
  door. Like the first witnesses of the Resurrection, Christians who gather each Sunday to
  experience and proclaim the presence of the Risen Lord are called <i>to evangelize and
  bear witness</i> in their daily lives. Given this, the Prayer after Communion and the
  Concluding Rite &#151; the Final Blessing and the Dismissal &#151; need to be better
  valued and appreciated, so that all who have shared in the Eucharist may come to a deeper
  sense of the responsibility which is entrusted to them. Once the assembly disperses,
  Christ's disciples return to their everyday surroundings with the commitment to make their
  whole life a gift, a spiritual sacrifice pleasing to God (cf. <i>Rom</i> 12:1). They feel
  indebted to their brothers and sisters because of what they have received in the
  celebration, not unlike the disciples of Emmaus who, once they had recognized the Risen
  Christ &quot;in the breaking of the bread&quot; (cf. <i>Lk</i> 24:30-32), felt the need to
  return immediately to share with their brothers and sisters the joy of meeting the Lord
  (cf. <i>Lk</i> 24:33-35). </p>
  <p><a name="3-11"></a><b><i>The Sunday obligation</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s46"></a>46. Since the Eucharist is the very heart of Sunday, it is clear why,
  from the earliest centuries, the Pastors of the Church have not ceased to remind the
  faithful of <i>the need to take part in the liturgical assembly</i>. &quot;Leave
  everything on the Lord's Day&quot;, urges the third century text known as the <i>Didascalia</i>,
  &quot;and run diligently to your assembly, because it is your praise of God. Otherwise,
  what excuse will they make to God, those who do not come together on the Lord's Day to
  hear the word of life and feed on the divine nourishment which lasts forever?&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#75">75</a>)<a name="75b"></a> The faithful have generally accepted this call of the
  Pastors with conviction of soul and, although there have been times and situations when
  this duty has not been perfectly met, one should never forget the genuine heroism of
  priests and faithful who have fulfilled this obligation even when faced with danger and
  the denial of religious freedom, as can be documented from the first centuries of
  Christianity up to our own time. </p>
  <p>In his first Apology addressed to the Emperor Antoninus and the Senate, Saint Justin
  proudly described the Christian practice of the Sunday assembly, which gathered in one
  place Christians from both the city and the countryside.(<a HREF="#76">76</a>)<a
  name="76b"></a> When, during the persecution of Diocletian, their assemblies were banned
  with the greatest severity, many were courageous enough to defy the imperial decree and
  accepted death rather than miss the Sunday Eucharist. This was the case of the martyrs of
  Abitina, in Proconsular Africa, who replied to their accusers: &quot;Without fear of any
  kind we have celebrated the Lord's Supper, because it cannot be missed; that is our
  law&quot;; &quot;We cannot live without the Lord's Supper&quot;. As she confessed her
  faith, one of the martyrs said: &quot;Yes, I went to the assembly and I celebrated the
  Lord's Supper with my brothers and sisters, because I am a Christian&quot;.(<a HREF="#77">77</a>)<a
  name="77b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s47"></a>47. Even if in the earliest times it was not judged necessary to be
  prescriptive, the Church has not ceased to confirm this obligation of conscience, which
  rises from the inner need felt so strongly by the Christians of the first centuries. It
  was only later, faced with the half-heartedness or negligence of some, that the Church had
  to make explicit the duty to attend Sunday Mass: more often than not, this was done in the
  form of exhortation, but at times the Church had to resort to specific canonical precepts.
  This was the case in a number of local Councils from the fourth century onwards (as at the
  Council of Elvira of 300, which speaks not of an obligation but of penalties after three
  absences)(<a HREF="#78">78</a>)<a name="78b"></a> and most especially from the sixth
  century onwards (as at the Council of Agde in 506).(<a HREF="#79">79</a>)<a name="79b"></a>
  These decrees of local Councils led to a universal practice, the obligatory character of
  which was taken as something quite normal.(<a HREF="#80">80</a>)<a name="80b"></a> </p>
  <p>The Code of Canon Law of 1917 for the first time gathered this tradition into a
  universal law.(<a HREF="#81">81</a>)<a name="81b"></a> The present Code reiterates this,
  saying that &quot;on Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to
  attend Mass&quot;.(<a HREF="#82">82</a>)<a name="82b"></a> This legislation has normally
  been understood as entailing a grave obligation: this is the teaching of the Catechism of
  the Catholic Church,(<a HREF="#83">83</a>)<a name="83b"></a> and it is easy to understand
  why if we keep in mind how vital Sunday is for the Christian life. </p>
  <p><a name="s48"></a>48. Today, as in the heroic times of the beginning, many who wish to
  live in accord with the demands of their faith are being faced with difficult situations
  in various parts of the world. They live in surroundings which are sometimes decidedly
  hostile and at other times &#151; more frequently in fact &#151; indifferent and
  unresponsive to the Gospel message. If believers are not to be overwhelmed, they must be
  able to count on the support of the Christian community. This is why they must be
  convinced that it is crucially important for the life of faith that they should come
  together with others on Sundays to celebrate the Passover of the Lord in the sacrament of
  the New Covenant. It is the special responsibility of the Bishops, therefore, &quot;to
  ensure that Sunday is appreciated by all the faithful, kept holy and celebrated as truly
  'the Lord's Day', on which the Church comes together to renew the remembrance of the
  Easter mystery in hearing the word of God, in offering the sacrifice of the Lord, in
  keeping the day holy by means of prayer, works of charity and abstention from work&quot;.(<a
  HREF="#84">84</a>)<a name="84b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s49"></a>49. Because the faithful are obliged to attend Mass unless there is a
  grave impediment, Pastors have the corresponding duty to offer to everyone the real
  possibility of fulfilling the precept. The provisions of Church law move in this
  direction, as for example in the faculty granted to priests, with the prior authorization
  of the diocesan Bishop, to celebrate more than one Mass on Sundays and holy days,(<a
  HREF="#85">85</a>)<a name="85b"></a> the institution of evening Masses(<a HREF="#86">86</a>)<a
  name="86b"></a> and the provision which allows the obligation to be fulfilled from
  Saturday evening onwards, starting at the time of First Vespers of Sunday.(<a HREF="#87">87</a>)<a
  name="87b"></a> From a liturgical point of view, in fact, holy days begin with First
  Vespers.(<a HREF="#88">88</a>)<a name="88b"></a> Consequently, the liturgy of what is
  sometimes called the &quot;Vigil Mass&quot; is in effect the &quot;festive&quot; Mass of
  Sunday, at which the celebrant is required to preach the homily and recite the Prayer of
  the Faithful. </p>
  <p>Moreover, Pastors should remind the faithful that when they are away from home on
  Sundays they are to take care to attend Mass wherever they may be, enriching the local
  community with their personal witness. At the same time, these communities should show a
  warm sense of welcome to visiting brothers and sisters, especially in places which attract
  many tourists and pilgrims, for whom it will often be necessary to provide special
  religious assistance.(<a HREF="#89">89</a>)<a name="89b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="3-12"></a><b><i>A joyful celebration in song</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s50"></a>50. Given the nature of Sunday Mass and its importance in the lives
  of the faithful, it must be prepared with special care. In ways dictated by pastoral
  experience and local custom in keeping with liturgical norms, efforts must be made to
  ensure that the celebration has the festive character appropriate to the day commemorating
  the Lord's Resurrection. To this end, it is important to devote attention to the <i>songs
  used by the assembly</i>, since singing is a particularly apt way to express a joyful
  heart, accentuating the solemnity of the celebration and fostering the sense of a common
  faith and a shared love. Care must be taken to ensure the quality, both of the texts and
  of the melodies, so that what is proposed today as new and creative will conform to
  liturgical requirements and be worthy of the Church's tradition which, in the field of
  sacred music, boasts a priceless heritage. </p>
  <p><a name="3-13"></a><b><i>A celebration involving all</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s51"></a>51. There is a need too to ensure that all those present, children
  and adults, take an active interest, by encouraging their involvement at those points
  where the liturgy suggests and recommends it.(<a HREF="#90">90</a>)<a name="90b"></a> Of
  course, it falls only to those who exercise the priestly ministry to effect the
  Eucharistic Sacrifice and to offer it to God in the name of the whole people.(<a
  HREF="#91">91</a>)<a name="91b"></a> This is the basis of the distinction, which is much
  more than a matter of discipline, between the task proper to the celebrant and that which
  belongs to deacons and the non-ordained faithful.(<a HREF="#92">92</a>)<a name="92b"></a>
  Yet the faithful must realize that, because of the common priesthood received in Baptism,
  &quot;they participate in the offering of the Eucharist&quot;.(<a HREF="#93">93</a>)<a
  name="93b"></a> Although there is a distinction of roles, they still &quot;offer to God
  the divine victim and themselves with him. Offering the sacrifice and receiving holy
  communion, they take part actively in the liturgy&quot;,(<a HREF="#93">94</a>)<a
  name="94b"></a> finding in it light and strength to live their baptismal priesthood and
  the witness of a holy life. </p>
  <p><a name="3-14"></a><b><i>Other moments of the Christian Sunday</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s52"></a>52. Sharing in the Eucharist is the heart of Sunday, but the duty to
  keep Sunday holy cannot be reduced to this. In fact, the Lord's Day is lived well if it is
  marked from beginning to end by grateful and active remembrance of God's saving work. This
  commits each of Christ's disciples to shape the other moments of the day &#151; those
  outside the liturgical context: family life, social relationships, moments of relaxation
  &#151; in such a way that the peace and joy of the Risen Lord will emerge in the ordinary
  events of life. For example, the relaxed gathering of parents and children can be an
  opportunity not only to listen to one another but also to share a few formative and more
  reflective moments. Even in lay life, when possible, why not make provision for special <i>times
  of prayer</i> &#151; especially the solemn celebration of Vespers, for example &#151; or <i>moments
  of catechesis</i>, which on the eve of Sunday or on Sunday afternoon might prepare for or
  complete the gift of the Eucharist in people's hearts? </p>
  <p>This rather traditional way of keeping Sunday holy has perhaps become more difficult
  for many people; but the Church shows her faith in the strength of the Risen Lord and the
  power of the Holy Spirit by making it known that, today more than ever, she is unwilling
  to settle for minimalism and mediocrity at the level of faith. She wants to help
  Christians to do what is most correct and pleasing to the Lord. And despite the
  difficulties, there are positive and encouraging signs. In many parts of the Church, a new
  need for prayer in its many forms is being felt; and this is a gift of the Holy Spirit.
  There is also a rediscovery of ancient religious practices, such as pilgrimages; and often
  the faithful take advantage of Sunday rest to visit a Shrine where, with the whole family
  perhaps, they can spend time in a more intense experience of faith. These are moments of
  grace which must be fostered through evangelization and guided by genuine pastoral wisdom.
  </p>
  <p><a name="3-15"></a><b><i>Sunday assemblies without a priest</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s53"></a>53. There remains the problem of parishes which do not have the
  ministry of a priest for the celebration of the Sunday Eucharist. This is often the case
  in young Churches, where one priest has pastoral responsibility for faithful scattered
  over a vast area. However, emergency situations can also arise in countries of
  long-standing Christian tradition, where diminishing numbers of clergy make it impossible
  to guarantee the presence of a priest in every parish community. In situations where the
  Eucharist cannot be celebrated, the Church recommends that the Sunday assembly come
  together even without a priest,(<a HREF="#95">95</a>)<a name="95b"></a> in keeping with
  the indications and directives of the Holy See which have been entrusted to the Episcopal
  Conferences for implementation.(<a HREF="#96">96</a>)<a name="96b"></a> Yet the objective
  must always remain the celebration of the Sacrifice of the Mass, the one way in which the
  Passover of the Lord becomes truly present, the only full realization of the Eucharistic
  assembly over which the priest presides <i>in persona Christi</i>, breaking the bread of
  the word and the Eucharist. At the pastoral level, therefore, everything has to be done to
  ensure that the Sacrifice of the Mass is made available as often as possible to the
  faithful who are regularly deprived of it, either by arranging the presence of a priest
  from time to time, or by taking every opportunity to organize a gathering in a central
  location accessible to scattered groups. </p>
  <p><a name="3-16"></a><b><i>Radio and television</i></b> </p>
  <p align="left"><a name="s54"></a>54. Finally, the faithful who, because of sickness,
  disability or some other serious cause, are prevented from taking part, should as best
  they can unite themselves with the celebration of Sunday Mass from afar, preferably by
  means of the readings and prayers for that day from the Missal, as well as through their
  desire for the Eucharist.(<a HREF="#97">97</a>)<a name="97b"></a> In many countries, radio
  and television make it possible to join in the Eucharistic celebration broadcast from some
  sacred place.(<a HREF="#98">98</a>)<a name="98b"></a> Clearly, this kind of broadcast does
  not in itself fulfil the Sunday obligation, which requires participation in the fraternal
  assembly gathered in one place, where Eucharistic communion can be received. But for those
  who cannot take part in the Eucharist and who are therefore excused from the obligation,
  radio and television are a precious help, especially if accompanied by the generous
  service of extraordinary ministers who bring the Eucharist to the sick, also bringing them
  the greeting and solidarity of the whole community. Sunday Mass thus produces rich fruits
  for these Christians too, and they are truly enabled to experience Sunday as &quot;the
  Lord's Day&quot; and &quot;the Church's day&quot;. </p>

  &nbsp;CHAPTER IV &nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center"><b><i>DIES HOMINIS</i></b> &nbsp; <br>
  <b>Sunday: Day of Joy, Rest and Solidarity</b> </p>
  <p><a name="4-1"></a><b><i>The &quot;full joy&quot; of Christ</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s55"></a>55. &quot;Blessed be he who has raised the great day of Sunday above
  all other days. The heavens and the earth, angels and of men give themselves over to
  joy&quot;.(<a HREF="#99">99</a>)<a name="99b"></a> This cry of the Maronite liturgy
  captures well the intense acclamations of joy which have always characterized Sunday in
  the liturgy of both East and West. Moreover, historically &#151; even before it was seen
  as a day of rest, which in any case was not provided for in the civil calendar &#151;
  Christians celebrated the weekly day of the Risen Lord primarily as a day of joy. &quot;On
  the first day of the week, you shall all rejoice&quot;, urges the <i>Didascalia</i>. (<a
  HREF="#100">100</a>)<a name="100b"></a> This was also emphasized by liturgical practice,
  through the choice of appropriate gestures. (<a HREF="#101">101</a>)<a name="101b"></a>
  Voicing an awareness widespread in the Church, Saint Augustine describes the joy of the
  weekly Easter: &quot;Fasting, is set aside and prayers are said standing, as a sign of the
  Resurrection, which is also why the Alleluia is sung on every Sunday&quot;. (<a
  HREF="#102">102</a>)<a name="102b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s56"></a>56. Beyond particular ritual forms, which can vary in time depending
  upon Church discipline, there remains the fact that Sunday, as a weekly echo of the first
  encounter with the Risen Lord, is unfailingly marked by the joy with which the disciples
  greeted the Master: &quot;The disciples rejoiced to see the Lord&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 20:20).
  This was the confirmation of the words which Jesus spoke before the Passion and which
  resound in every Christian generation: &quot;You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will
  turn to joy&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 16:20). Had not he himself prayed for this, that the
  disciples would have &quot;the fullness of his joy&quot; (cf. <i>Jn</i> 17:13)? The
  festive character of the Sunday Eucharist expresses the joy that Christ communicates to
  his Church through the gift of the Spirit. Joy is precisely one of the fruits of the Holy
  Spirit(cf. <i>Rom</i> 14:17; <i>Gal</i> 5:22). </p>
  <p><a name="s57"></a>57. Therefore, if we wish to rediscover the full meaning of Sunday,
  we must rediscover this aspect of the life of faith. Certainly, Christian joy must mark
  the whole of life, and not just one day of the week. But in virtue of its significance as <i>the
  day of the Risen Lord</i>, celebrating God's work of creation and &quot;new
  creation&quot;, Sunday is the day of joy in a very special way, indeed the day most
  suitable for learning how to rejoice and to rediscover the true nature and deep roots of
  joy. This joy should never be confused with shallow feelings of satisfaction and pleasure,
  which inebriate the senses and emotions for a brief moment, but then leave the heart
  unfulfilled and perhaps even embittered. In the Christian view, joy is much more enduring
  and consoling; as the saints attest, it can hold firm even in the dark night of suffering.
  (<a HREF="#103">103</a>)<a name="103b"></a> It is, in a certain sense, a
  &quot;virtue&quot; to be nurtured. </p>
  <p><a name="s58"></a>58. Yet there is no conflict whatever between Christian joy and true
  human joys, which in fact are exalted and find their ultimate foundation precisely in the
  joy of the glorified Christ, the perfect image and revelation of man as God intended. As
  my revered predecessor Paul VI wrote in his Exhortation on Christian joy: &quot;In
  essence, Christian joy is a sharing in the unfathomable joy, at once divine and human,
  found in the heart of the glorified Christ&quot;. (<a HREF="#104">104</a>)<a name="104b"></a>
  Pope Paul concluded his Exhortation by asking that, on the Lord's Day, the Church should
  witness powerfully to the joy experienced by the Apostles when they saw the Lord on the
  evening of Easter. To this end, he urged pastors to insist &quot;upon the need for the
  baptized to celebrate the Sunday Eucharist in joy. How could they neglect this encounter,
  this banquet which Christ prepares for us in his love? May our sharing in it be most
  worthy and joyful! It is Christ, crucified and glorified, who comes among his disciples,
  to lead them all together into the newness of his Resurrection. This is the climax, here
  below, of the covenant of love between God and his people: the sign and source of
  Christian joy, a stage on the way to the eternal feast&quot;. (<a HREF="#104">105</a>)<a
  name="105b"></a> This vision of faith shows <u><font color="#FF0000">the Christian Sunday
  to be a true &quot;time for celebration&quot;, a day given by God to men and women for
  their full human and spiritual growth.</font></u> </p>
  <p><a name="4-2"></a><b><i>The fulfilment of the Sabbath</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s59"></a>59. This aspect of <u><font color="#FF0000">the Christian Sunday
  shows in a special way how it is the fulfilment of the Old Testament Sabbath.</font></u>
  On the Lord's Day, which &#151; as we have already said &#151; the Old Testament links to
  the work of creation (cf. <i>Gn</i> 2:1-3; <i>Ex</i> 20:8-11) and the Exodus (cf. <i>Dt</i>
  5:12-15), the Christian is called to proclaim the new creation and the new covenant
  brought about in the Paschal Mystery of Christ. Far from being abolished, the celebration
  of creation becomes more profound within a Christocentric perspective, being seen in the
  light of the God's plan &quot;to unite all things in [Christ], things in heaven and things
  on earth&quot; (<i>Eph</i> 1:10). The remembrance of the liberation of the Exodus also
  assumes its full meaning as it becomes a remembrance of the universal redemption
  accomplished by Christ in his Death and Resurrection. More than a &quot;replacement&quot;
  for the Sabbath, therefore, Sunday is its fulfilment, and in a certain sense its extension
  and full expression in the ordered unfolding of the history of salvation, which reaches
  its culmination in Christ. </p>
  <p><a name="s60"></a>60. In this perspective, <u><font color="#FF0000">the biblical
  theology of the &quot;Sabbath&quot; can be recovered in full, without compromising the
  Christian character of Sunday</font></u>. It is a theology which leads us ever anew and in
  unfailing awe to the mystery of the beginning, when the eternal Word of God, by a free
  decision of love, created the world from nothing. The work of creation was sealed by the
  blessing and consecration of the day on which God ceased &quot;from all the work which he
  had done in creation&quot; (<i>Gn</i> 2:3). This day of God's rest confers meaning upon
  time, which in the sequence of weeks assumes not only a chronological regularity but also,
  in a manner of speaking, a theological resonance. The constant return of the &quot;<i>shabbat</i>&quot;
  ensures that there is no risk of time being closed in upon itself, since, in welcoming God
  and his <i>kairoi</i> &#151; the moments of his grace and his saving acts &#151; time
  remains open to eternity. </p>
  <p><a name="s61"></a>61. As the seventh day blessed and consecrated by God, the
  &quot;shabbat&quot; concludes the whole work of creation, and is therefore immediately
  linked to the work of the sixth day when God made man &quot;in his image and
  likeness&quot; (cf. <i>Gn</i> 1:26). This very close connection between the &quot;day of
  God&quot; and the &quot;day of man&quot; did not escape the Fathers in their meditation on
  the biblical creation story. Saint Ambrose says in this regard: &quot;Thanks, then, to the
  Lord our God who accomplished a work in which he might find rest. He made the heavens, but
  I do not read that he found rest there; he made the stars, the moon, the sun, and neither
  do I read that he found rest in them. I read instead that he made man and that then he
  rested, finding in man one to whom he could offer the forgiveness of sins&quot;. (<a
  HREF="#106">106</a>)<a name="106b"></a> Thus there will be for ever a direct link between
  the &quot;day of God&quot; and the &quot;day of man&quot;. When the divine commandment
  declares: &quot;Remember the Sabbath day in order to keep it holy&quot; (<i>Ex</i> 20:8),
  the rest decreed in order to honour the day dedicated to God is not at all a burden
  imposed upon man, but rather an aid to help him to recognize his life-giving and
  liberating dependence upon the Creator, and at the same time his calling to cooperate in
  the Creator's work and to receive his grace. In honouring God's &quot;rest&quot;, man
  fully discovers himself, and <u><font color="#FF0000">thus the Lord's Day bears the
  profound imprint of God's blessing</font></u> (cf. <i>Gn</i> 2:3), by virtue of which, we
  might say, it is endowed in a way similar to the animals and to man himself, with a kind
  of &quot;fruitfulness&quot; (cf. <i>Gn</i> 1:22, 28). This &quot;fruitfulness&quot; is
  apparent above all in filling and, in a certain sense, &quot;multiplying&quot; time
  itself, deepening in men and women the joy of living and the desire to foster and
  communicate life. </p>
  <p><a name="s62"></a>62. It is the duty of Christians therefore to remember that, although
  the practices of the Jewish Sabbath are gone, surpassed as they are by the
  &quot;fulfilment&quot; which Sunday brings, the underlying reasons for keeping &quot;the
  Lord's Day&quot; holy &#151; inscribed solemnly in <u><font color="#FF0000">the Ten
  Commandments &#151; remain valid, though they need to be reinterpreted in the light of the
  theology and spirituality of Sunday</font></u>: &quot;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
  holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labour, and do all your work;
  but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. Then you shall do no work, you, or
  your son, or your daughter, or your servant, or your maid, or your ox, or your ass, or any
  of your beasts, or the foreigner within your gates, that your servant and maid may rest as
  well as you. You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord
  your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore
  the Lord your God commanded that you keep the Sabbath day&quot; (<i>Dt</i> 5:12-15). Here
  the Sabbath observance is closely linked with the liberation which God accomplished for
  his people. </p>
  <p><a name="s63"></a>63. Christ came to accomplish a new &quot;exodus&quot;, to restore
  freedom to the oppressed. <u><font color="#FF0000">He performed many healings on the
  Sabbath (cf. <i>Mt</i> 12:9-14 and parallels), certainly not to violate the Lord's Day,
  but to reveal its full meaning: &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the
  Sabbath&quot;</font></u> (<i>Mk</i> 2:27). Opposing the excessively legalistic
  interpretation of some of his contemporaries, and developing the true meaning of the
  biblical Sabbath, Jesus, as &quot;Lord of the Sabbath&quot; (<i>Mk</i> 2:28), restores to
  the Sabbath observance its liberating character, carefully safeguarding the rights of God
  and the rights of man. This is why <u><font color="#FF0000">Christians, called as they are
  to proclaim the liberation won by the blood of Christ, felt that they had the authority to
  transfer the meaning of the Sabbath to the day of the Resurrection.</font></u> The
  Passover of Christ has in fact liberated man from a slavery more radical than any weighing
  upon an oppressed people &#151; the slavery of sin, which alienates man from God, and
  alienates man from himself and from others, constantly sowing within history the seeds of
  evil and violence. </p>
  <p><a name="4-3"></a><b><i>The day of rest</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s64"></a>64. For several centuries, Christians observed Sunday simply as a day
  of worship, without being able to give it the specific meaning of Sabbath rest. Only in
  the fourth century did the civil law of the Roman Empire recognize the weekly recurrence,
  determining that on &quot;the day of the sun&quot; the judges, the people of the cities
  and the various trade corporations would not work. (<a HREF="#107">107</a>)<a name="107b"></a>
  <u><font color="#FF0000">Christians rejoiced to see thus removed the obstacles which until
  then had sometimes made observance of the Lord's Day heroic.</font></u> They could now
  devote themselves to prayer in common without hindrance. (<a HREF="#108">108</a>)<a
  name="108b"></a> </p>
  <p><u><font color="#FF0000">It would therefore be wrong to see in this legislation of the
  rhythm of the week a mere historical circumstance with no special significance for the
  Church and which she could simply set aside.</font></u> Even after the fall of the Empire,
  the Councils did not cease to insist upon the arrangements regarding Sunday rest. In
  countries where Christians are in the minority and where the festive days of the calendar
  do not coincide with Sunday, it is still Sunday which remains the Lord's Day, the day on
  which the faithful come together for the Eucharistic assembly. But this involves real
  sacrifices. For Christians it is not normal that Sunday, the day of joyful celebration,
  should not also be a day of rest, and it is difficult for them to keep Sunday holy if they
  do not have enough free time. </p>
  <p><a name="s65"></a>65. By contrast, the link between the Lord's Day and the day of rest
  in civil society has a meaning and importance which go beyond the distinctly Christian
  point of view. The alternation between work and rest, built into human nature, is willed
  by God himself, as appears in the creation story in the Book of Genesis (cf. 2:2-3; <i>Ex</i>
  20:8-11): rest is something &quot;sacred&quot;, because it is man's way of withdrawing
  from the sometimes excessively demanding cycle of earthly tasks in order to renew his
  awareness that everything is the work of God. There is a risk that the prodigious power
  over creation which God gives to man can lead him to forget that God is the Creator upon
  whom everything depends. It is all the more urgent to recognize this dependence in our own
  time, when science and technology have so incredibly increased the power which man
  exercises through his work. </p>
  <p><a name="s66"></a>66. Finally, it should not be forgotten that even in our own day work
  is very oppressive for many people, either because of miserable working conditions and
  long hours &#151; especially in the poorer regions of the world &#151; or because of the
  persistence in economically more developed societies of too many cases of injustice and
  exploitation of man by man. <u><font color="#FF0000">When, through the centuries, she has
  made laws concerning Sunday rest, (<a HREF="#109">109</a>)<a name="109b"></a> the Church
  has had in mind above all the work of servants and workers</font></u>, certainly not
  because this work was any less worthy when compared to the spiritual requirements of
  Sunday observance, but rather because it needed greater regulation to lighten its burden
  and thus enable everyone to keep the Lord's Day holy. In this matter, my predecessor <u><font
  color="#FF0000">Pope Leo XIII in his Encyclical <i>Rerum Novarum</i> spoke of Sunday rest
  as a worker's right which the State must guarantee.</font></u> (<a HREF="#110">110</a>)<a
  name="110b"></a> </p>
  <p>In our own historical context there remains the obligation to ensure that everyone can
  enjoy the freedom, rest and relaxation which human dignity requires, together with the
  associated religious, family, cultural and interpersonal needs which are difficult to meet
  if there is no guarantee of at least one day of the week on which people can <i>both</i>
  rest and celebrate. Naturally, this right of workers to rest presupposes their right to
  work and, as we reflect on the question of the Christian understanding of Sunday, we
  cannot but recall with a deep sense of solidarity the hardship of countless men and women
  who, because of the lack of jobs, are forced to remain inactive on workdays as well. </p>
  <p><a name="s67"></a>67. Through Sunday rest, daily concerns and tasks can find their
  proper perspective: the material things about which we worry give way to spiritual values;
  in a moment of encounter and less pressured exchange, we see the true face of the people
  with whom we live. Even the beauties of nature &#151; too often marred by the desire to
  exploit, which turns against man himself &#151; can be rediscovered and enjoyed to the
  full. As the day on which man is at peace with God, with himself and with others, Sunday
  becomes a moment when people can look anew upon the wonders of nature, allowing themselves
  to be caught up in that marvelous and mysterious harmony which, in the words of Saint
  Ambrose, weds the many elements of the cosmos in a &quot;bond of communion and peace&quot;
  by &quot;an inviolable law of concord and love&quot;. (<a HREF="#111">111</a>)<a
  name="111b"></a> Men and women then come to a deeper sense, as the Apostle says, that
  &quot;everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received
  with thanksgiving, for then it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer&quot; (<i>1
  Tim</i> 4:4-5). If after six days of work &#151; reduced in fact to five for many people
  &#151; people look for time to relax and to pay more attention to other aspects of their
  lives, this corresponds to an authentic need which is in full harmony with the vision of
  the Gospel message. Believers are therefore called to satisfy this need in a way
  consistent with the manifestation of their personal and community faith, as expressed in
  the celebration and sanctification of the Lord's Day. </p>
  <p>Therefore, also in the particular circumstances of our own time, <u><font
  color="#FF0000">Christians will naturally strive to ensure that civil legislation respects
  their duty to keep Sunday holy</font></u>. In any case, they are obliged in conscience to
  arrange their Sunday rest in a way which allows them to take part in the Eucharist,
  refraining from work and activities which are incompatible with the sanctification of the
  Lord's Day, with its characteristic joy and necessary rest for spirit and body. (<a
  HREF="#112">112</a>)<a name="112b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s68"></a>68. In order that rest may not degenerate into emptiness or boredom,
  it must offer spiritual enrichment, greater freedom, opportunities for contemplation and
  fraternal communion. Therefore, among the forms of culture and entertainment which society
  offers, the faithful should choose those which are most in keeping with a life lived in
  obedience to the precepts of the Gospel. <u><font color="#FF0000">Sunday rest then becomes
  &quot;prophetic&quot;, affirming </font></u><font color="#000000">not only</font><u><font
  color="#FF0000"> the absolute primacy of God,</font></u> but also the primacy and dignity
  of the person with respect to the demands of social and economic life, and anticipating in
  a certain sense the &quot;new heavens&quot; and the &quot;new earth&quot;, in which
  liberation from slavery to needs will be final and complete. In short, <u><font
  color="#FF0000">the Lord's Day thus becomes in the truest sense <i>the day of man</i> as
  well.</font></u> </p>
  <p><a name="4-4"></a><b><i>A day of solidarity</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s69"></a>69. Sunday should also give the faithful an opportunity to devote
  themselves to works of mercy, charity and apostolate. To experience the joy of the Risen
  Lord deep within is to share fully the love which pulses in his heart: there is no joy
  without love! Jesus himself explains this, linking the &quot;new commandment&quot; with
  the gift of joy: &quot;If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I
  have kept the Father's commandments and remain in his love. I have told you this that my
  own joy may be in you and your joy may be complete. This is my commandment: that you love
  one another as I have loved you&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 15:10-12). </p>
  <p>The Sunday Eucharist, therefore, not only does not absolve the faithful from the duties
  of charity, but on the contrary commits them even more &quot;to all the works of charity,
  of mercy, of apostolic outreach, by means of which it is seen that the faithful of Christ
  are not of this world and yet are the light of the world, giving glory to the Father in
  the presence of men&quot;. (<a HREF="#113">113</a>)<a name="113b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s70"></a>70. Ever since Apostolic times, the Sunday gathering has in fact been
  for Christians a moment of fraternal sharing with the very poor. &quot;On the first day of
  the week, each of you is to put aside and save whatever extra you earn&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i>
  16:2), says Saint Paul referring to the collection organized for the poor Churches of
  Judaea. In the Sunday Eucharist, the believing heart opens wide to embrace all aspects of
  the Church. But the full range of the apostolic summons needs to be accepted: far from
  trying to create a narrow &quot;gift&quot; mentality, Paul calls rather for a demanding <i>culture
  of sharing</i>, to be lived not only among the members of the community itself but also in
  society as a whole. (<a HREF="#114">114</a>)<a name="114b"></a> More than ever, we need to
  listen once again to the stern warning which Paul addresses to the community at Corinth,
  guilty of having humiliated the poor in the fraternal <i>agape</i> which accompanied
  &quot;the Lord's Supper&quot;: &quot;When you meet together, it is not the Lord's Supper
  that you eat. For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and
  another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the
  Church of God and humiliate those who have nothing?&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i> 11:20-22). James
  is equally forceful in what he writes: &quot;If a man with gold rings and in fine clothing
  comes into your assembly and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, and you pay
  attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, 'Take a seat here, please',
  while you say to the poor man, 'Stand there', or, 'Sit at my feet', have you not made
  distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?&quot; (2:2-4). </p>
  <p><a name="s71"></a>71. The teachings of the Apostles struck a sympathetic chord from the
  earliest centuries, and evoked strong echoes in the preaching of the Fathers of the
  Church. Saint Ambrose addressed words of fire to the rich who presumed to fulfil their
  religious obligations by attending church without sharing their goods with the poor, and
  who perhaps even exploited them: &quot;You who are rich, do you hear what the Lord God
  says? Yet you come into church not to give to the poor but to take instead&quot;. (<a
  HREF="#115">115</a>)<a name="115b"></a> Saint John Chrysostom is no less demanding:
  &quot;Do you wish to honour the body of Christ? Do not ignore him when he is naked. Do not
  pay him homage in the temple clad in silk only then to neglect him outside where he
  suffers cold and nakedness. He who said: 'This is my body' is the same One who said: 'You
  saw me hungry and you gave me no food', and 'Whatever you did to the least of my brothers
  you did also to me' ... What good is it if the Eucharistic table is overloaded with golden
  chalices, when he is dying of hunger? Start by satisfying his hunger, and then with what
  is left you may adorn the altar as well&quot;. (<a HREF="#116">116</a>)<a name="116b"></a>
  </p>
  <p>These words effectively remind the Christian community of the duty to make the
  Eucharist the place where fraternity becomes practical solidarity, where the last are the
  first in the minds and attentions of the brethren, where Christ himself &#151; through the
  generous gifts from the rich to the very poor &#151; may somehow prolong in time the
  miracle of the multiplication of the loaves. (<a HREF="#117">117</a>)<a name="117b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s72"></a>72. The Eucharist is an event and programme of true brotherhood. From
  the Sunday Mass there flows a tide of charity destined to spread into the whole life of
  the faithful, beginning by inspiring the very way in which they live the rest of Sunday.
  If Sunday is a day of joy, Christians should declare by their actual behaviour that we
  cannot be happy &quot;on our own&quot;. They look around to find people who may need their
  help. It may be that in their neighbourhood or among those they know there are sick
  people, elderly people, children or immigrants who precisely on Sundays feel more keenly
  their isolation, needs and suffering. It is true that commitment to these people cannot be
  restricted to occasional Sunday gestures. But presuming a wider sense of commitment, why
  not make the Lord's Day a more intense time of sharing, encouraging all the inventiveness
  of which Christian charity is capable? Inviting to a meal people who are alone, visiting
  the sick, providing food for needy families, spending a few hours in voluntary work and
  acts of solidarity: these would certainly be ways of bringing into people's lives the love
  of Christ received at the Eucharistic table. </p>
  <p align="left"><a name="s73"></a>73. Lived in this way, not only the Sunday Eucharist but
  the whole of Sunday becomes a great school of charity, justice and peace. The presence of
  the Risen Lord in the midst of his people becomes an undertaking of solidarity, a
  compelling force for inner renewal, an inspiration to change the structures of sin in
  which individuals, communities and at times entire peoples are entangled. Far from being
  an escape, the Christian Sunday is a &quot;prophecy&quot; inscribed on time itself, a
  prophecy obliging the faithful to follow in the footsteps of the One who came &quot;to
  preach good news to the poor, to proclaim release to captives and new sight to the blind,
  to set at liberty those who are oppressed, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the
  Lord&quot; (<i>Lk</i> 4:18-19). In the Sunday commemoration of Easter, believers learn
  from Christ, and remembering his promise: &quot;I leave you peace, my peace I give
  you&quot; (<i>Jn</i> 14:27), they become in their turn <i>builders of peace</i>. </p>

  &nbsp;CHAPTER V &nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center"><b><i>DIES DIERUM</i></b> &nbsp; <br>
  <b>Sunday: the Primordial Feast,</b> <br>
  <b>Revealing the Meaning of Time</b> </p>
  <p><a name="5-1"></a><b><i>Christ the Alpha and Omega of time</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s74"></a>74. &quot;In Christianity time has a fundamental importance. Within
  the dimension of time the world was created; within it the history of salvation unfolds,
  finding its culmination in the 'fullness of time' of the Incarnation, and its goal in the
  glorious return of the Son of God at the end of time. In Jesus Christ, the Word made
  flesh, time becomes a dimension of God, who is himself eternal&quot;. (<a HREF="#118">118</a>)<a
  name="118b"></a> </p>
  <p>In the light of the New Testament, the years of Christ's earthly life truly constitute
  the <i>centre of time</i>; this centre reaches its apex in the Resurrection. It is true
  that Jesus is God made man from the very moment of his conception in the womb of the
  Blessed Virgin, but only in the Resurrection is his humanity wholly transfigured and
  glorified, thus revealing the fullness of his divine identity and glory. In his speech in
  the synagogue at Antioch in Pisidia (cf. <i>Acts</i> 13:33), Paul applies the words of
  Psalm 2 to the Resurrection of Christ: &quot;You are my Son, this day I have begotten
  you&quot; (v. 7). It is precisely for this reason that, in celebrating the Easter Vigil,
  the Church acclaims the Risen Christ as &quot;the Beginning and End, the Alpha and
  Omega&quot;. These are the words spoken by the celebrant as he prepares the Paschal
  candle, which bears the number of the current year. These words clearly attest that
  &quot;Christ is the Lord of time; he is its beginning and its end; every year, every day
  and every moment are embraced by his Incarnation and Resurrection, and thus become part of
  the 'fullness of time'&quot;. (<a HREF="#118">119</a>)<a name="119b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s75"></a>75. Since Sunday is the weekly Easter, recalling and making present
  the day upon which Christ rose from the dead, it is also the day which reveals the meaning
  of time. It has nothing in common with the cosmic cycles according to which natural
  religion and human culture tend to impose a structure on time, succumbing perhaps to the
  myth of eternal return. The Christian Sunday is wholly other! Springing from the
  Resurrection, it cuts through human time, the months, the years, the centuries, like a
  directional arrow which points them towards their target: Christ's Second Coming. Sunday
  foreshadows the last day, the day of the <i>Parousia</i>, which in a way is already
  anticipated by Christ's glory in the event of the Resurrection. </p>
  <p>In fact, everything that will happen until the end of the world will be no more than an
  extension and unfolding of what happened on the day when the battered body of the
  Crucified Lord was raised by the power of the Spirit and became in turn the wellspring of
  the Spirit for all humanity. Christians know that there is no need to wait for another
  time of salvation, since, however long the world may last, they are already living in <i>the
  last times</i>. Not only the Church, but the cosmos itself and history are ceaselessly
  ruled and governed by the glorified Christ. It is this life-force which propels creation,
  &quot;groaning in birth-pangs until now&quot; (<i>Rom</i> 8:22), towards the goal of its
  full redemption. Mankind can have only a faint intuition of this process, but Christians
  have the key and the certainty. Keeping Sunday holy is the important witness which they
  are called to bear, so that every stage of human history will be upheld by hope. </p>
  <p><a name="5-2"></a><b><i>Sunday in the Liturgical Year</i></b> </p>
  <p><a name="s76"></a>76. <font color="#FF0000"><u>With its weekly recurrence, the Lord's
  Day is rooted in the most ancient tradition of the Church</u></font> and is vitally
  important for the Christian. But there was another rhythm which soon established itself: <i>the
  annual liturgical cycle</i>. Human psychology in fact desires the celebration of
  anniversaries, associating the return of dates and seasons with the remembrance of past
  events. When these events are decisive in the life of a people, their celebration
  generally creates a festive atmosphere which breaks the monotony of daily routine. </p>
  <p>Now, by God's design, the great saving events upon which the Church's life is founded
  were closely linked to the annual Jewish feasts of Passover and Pentecost, and were
  prophetically foreshadowed in them. Since the second century, the annual celebration of
  Easter by Christians &#151; having been added to the weekly Easter celebration &#151;
  allowed a more ample meditation on the mystery of Christ crucified and risen. Preceded by
  a preparatory fast, celebrated in the course of a long vigil, extended into the fifty days
  leading to Pentecost, the feast of Easter &#151; &quot;solemnity of solemnities&quot;
  &#151; became the day <i>par excellence</i> for the initiation of catechumens. Through
  baptism they die to sin and rise to a new life because Jesus &quot;was put to death for
  our sins and raised for our justification&quot; (<i>Rom</i> 4:25; cf. 6:3-11). Intimately
  connected to the Paschal Mystery, the Solemnity of Pentecost takes on special importance,
  celebrating as it does the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles gathered with Mary
  and inaugurating the mission to all peoples. (<a HREF="#120">120</a>)<a name="120b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s77"></a>77. A similar commemorative logic guided the arrangement of the
  entire Liturgical Year. As the Second Vatican Council recalls, the Church wished to extend
  throughout the year &quot;the entire mystery of Christ, from the Incarnation and Nativity
  to the Ascension, to the day of Pentecost and to the waiting in blessed hope for the
  return of the Lord. Remembering in this way the mysteries of redemption, the Church opens
  to the faithful the treasury of the Lord's power and merits, making them present in some
  sense to all times, so that the faithful may approach them and be filled by them with the
  grace of salvation&quot;. (<a HREF="#121">121</a>)<a name="121b"></a> </p>
  <p>After Easter and Pentecost, the most solemn celebration is undoubtedly the Nativity of
  the Lord, when Christians ponder the mystery of the Incarnation and contemplate the Word
  of God who deigns to assume our humanity in order to give us a share in his divinity. </p>
  <p><a name="s78"></a>78. Likewise, &quot;in celebrating this annual cycle of the mysteries
  of Christ, the holy Church venerates with special love the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of
  God, united forever with the saving work of her Son&quot;. (<a HREF="#121">122</a>)<a
  name="122b"></a> In a similar way, by inserting into the annual cycle the commemoration of
  the martyrs and other saints on the occasion of their anniversaries, &quot;the Church
  proclaims the Easter mystery of the saints who suffered with Christ and with him are now
  glorified&quot;. (<a HREF="#121">123</a>)<a name="123b"></a> When celebrated in the true
  spirit of the liturgy, the commemoration of the saints does not obscure the centrality of
  Christ, but on the contrary extols it, demonstrating as it does the power of the
  redemption wrought by him. As Saint Paulinus of Nola sings, &quot;all things pass, but the
  glory of the saints endures in Christ, who renews all things, while he himself remains
  unchanged&quot;. (<a HREF="#124">124</a>)<a name="124b"></a> The intrinsic relationship
  between the glory of the saints and that of Christ is built into the very arrangement of
  the Liturgical Year, and is expressed most eloquently in the fundamental and sovereign
  character of Sunday as the Lord's Day. Following the seasons of the Liturgical Year in the
  Sunday observance which structures it from beginning to end, the ecclesial and spiritual
  commitment of Christians comes to be profoundly anchored in Christ, in whom believers find
  their reason for living and from whom they draw sustenance and inspiration. </p>
  <p><a name="s79"></a>79. Sunday emerges therefore as the natural model for understanding
  and celebrating these feast-days of the Liturgical Year, which are of such value for the
  Christian life that the Church has chosen to emphasize their importance by making it
  obligatory for the faithful to attend Mass and to observe a time of rest, even though
  these feast-days may fall on variable days of the week. (<a HREF="#125">125</a>)<a
  name="125b"></a> Their number has been changed from time to time, taking into account
  social and economic conditions, as also how firmly they are established in tradition, and
  how well they are supported by civil legislation. (<a HREF="#126">126</a>)<a name="126b"></a>
  </p>
  <p>The present canonical and liturgical provisions allow each Episcopal Conference,
  because of particular circumstances in one country or another, to reduce the list of Holy
  Days of obligation. Any decision in this regard needs to receive the special approval of
  the Apostolic See, (<a HREF="#127">127</a>)<a name="127b"></a> and in such cases the
  celebration of a mystery of the Lord, such as the Epiphany, the Ascension or the Solemnity
  of the Body and Blood of Christ, must be transferred to Sunday, in accordance with
  liturgical norms, so that the faithful are not denied the chance to meditate upon the
  mystery. (<a HREF="#128">128</a>)<a name="128b"></a> Pastors should also take care to
  encourage the faithful to attend Mass on other important feast-days celebrated during the
  week. (<a HREF="#129">129</a>)<a name="129b"></a> </p>
  <p><a name="s80"></a>80. There is a need for special pastoral attention to the many
  situations where there is a risk that the popular and cultural traditions of a region may
  intrude upon the celebration of Sundays and other liturgical feast-days, mingling the
  spirit of genuine Christian faith with elements which are foreign to it and may distort
  it. In such cases, catechesis and well-chosen pastoral initiatives need to clarify these
  situations, eliminating all that is incompatible with the Gospel of Christ. At the same
  time, it should not be forgotten that these traditions &#151; and, by analogy, some recent
  cultural initiatives in civil society &#151; often embody values which are not difficult
  to integrate with the demands of faith. It rests with the discernment of Pastors to
  preserve the genuine values found in the culture of a particular social context and
  especially in popular piety, so that liturgical celebration &#151; above all on Sundays
  and holy days &#151; does not suffer but rather may actually benefit. (<a HREF="#129">130</a>)<a
  name="130b"></a> </p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;<a NAME="conclusion"></a> <b>CONCLUSION</b> </p>
  <p><a name="s81"></a>81. <u><font color="#FF0000">The spiritual and pastoral riches of
  Sunday, as it has been handed on to us by tradition</font></u>, are truly great. When its
  significance and implications are understood in their entirety, Sunday in a way becomes a
  synthesis of the Christian life and a condition for living it well. It is clear therefore
  why the observance of the Lord's Day is so close to the Church's heart, and why in the
  Church's discipline it remains a real obligation. Yet more than as a precept, the
  observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is
  crucially important that all the faithful should be convinced that they cannot live their
  faith or share fully in the life of the Christian community unless they take part
  regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly. The Eucharist is the full realization of the
  worship which humanity owes to God, and it cannot be compared to any other religious
  experience. A particularly efficacious expression of this is the Sunday gathering of the
  entire community, obedient to the voice of the Risen Lord who calls the faithful together
  to give them the light of his word and the nourishment of his Body as the perennial
  sacramental wellspring of redemption. The grace flowing from this wellspring renews
  mankind, life and history. </p>
  <p><a name="s82"></a>82. It is with this strong conviction of faith, and with awareness of
  the heritage of human values which the observance of Sunday entails, that Christians today
  must face the enticements of a culture which has accepted the benefits of rest and free
  time, but which often uses them frivolously and is at times attracted by morally
  questionable forms of entertainment. Certainly, Christians are no different from other
  people in enjoying the weekly day of rest; but at the same time they are keenly aware of
  the uniqueness and originality of Sunday, the day on which they are called to celebrate
  their salvation and the salvation of all humanity. Sunday is the day of joy and the day of
  rest precisely because it is &quot;the Lord's Day&quot;, the day of the Risen Lord. </p>
  <p><a name="s83"></a>83. Understood and lived in this fashion, Sunday in a way becomes the
  soul of the other days, and in this sense we can recall the insight of Origen that the
  perfect Christian &quot;is always in the Lord's Day, and is always celebrating
  Sunday&quot;. (<a HREF="#131">131</a>)<a name="131b"></a> Sunday is a true school, an
  enduring programme of Church pedagogy &#151; an irreplaceable pedagogy, especially with
  social conditions now marked more and more by a fragmentation and cultural pluralism which
  constantly test the faithfulness of individual Christians to the practical demands of
  their faith. In many parts of the world, we see a &quot;diaspora&quot; Christianity, which
  is put to the test because the scattered disciples of Christ can no longer easily maintain
  contact with one another, and lack the support of the structures and traditions proper to
  Christian culture. In a situation of such difficulty, the opportunity to come together on
  Sundays with fellow believers, exchanging gifts of brother- hood, is an indispensable
  help. </p>
  <p><a name="s84"></a>84. Sustaining Christian life as it does, Sunday has the additional
  value of being a testimony and a proclamation. As a day of prayer, communion and joy,
  Sunday resounds throughout society, emanating vital energies and reasons for hope. Sunday
  is the proclamation that time, in which he who is the Risen Lord of history makes his
  home, is not the grave of our illusions but the cradle of an ever new future, an
  opportunity given to us to turn the fleeting moments of this life into seeds of eternity.
  Sunday is an invitation to look ahead; it is the day on which the Christian community
  cries out to Christ, &quot;<i>Maranatha</i>: Come, O Lord!&quot; (<i>1 Cor</i> 16:22).
  With this cry of hope and expectation, the Church is the companion and support of human
  hope. From Sunday to Sunday, enlightened by Christ, she goes forward towards the unending
  Sunday of the heavenly Jerusalem, which &quot;has no need of the sun or moon to shine upon
  it, for the glory of God is its light and its lamp is the Lamb&quot; (<i>Rev</i> 21:23). </p>
  <p><a name="s85"></a>85. As she strains towards her goal, the Church is sustained and
  enlivened by the Spirit. It is he who awakens memory and makes present for every
  generation of believers the event of the Resurrection. He is the inward gift uniting us to
  the Risen Lord and to our brothers and sisters in the intimacy of a single body, reviving
  our faith, filling our hearts with charity and renewing our hope. The Spirit is
  unfailingly present to every one of the Church's days, appearing unpredictably and
  lavishly with the wealth of his gifts. But it is in the Sunday gathering for the weekly
  celebration of Easter that the Church listens to the Spirit in a special way and reaches
  out with him to Christ in the ardent desire that he return in glory: &quot;The Spirit and
  the Bride say, 'Come!'&quot; (<i>Rev</i> 22:17). Precisely in consideration of the role of
  the Spirit, I have wished that this exhortation aimed at rediscovering the meaning of
  Sunday should appear in this year which, in the immediate preparation for the Jubilee, is
  dedicated to the Holy Spirit. </p>
  <p><a name="s86"></a>86. I entrust this Apostolic Letter to the intercession of the
  Blessed Virgin, that it may be received and put into practice by the Christian community.
  Without in any way detracting from the centrality of Christ and his Spirit, Mary is always
  present in the Church's Sunday. It is the mystery of Christ itself which demands this:
  indeed, how could she who is <i>Mater Domini</i> and <i>Mater Ecclesiae</i> fail to be
  uniquely present on the day which is both <i>dies Domini</i> and <i>dies Ecclesiae</i>? </p>
  <p><u><font color="#FF0000">As they listen to the word proclaimed in the Sunday assembly,
  the faithful look to the Virgin Mary</font></u>, learning from her to keep it and ponder
  it in their hearts (cf. <i>Lk</i> 2:19). With Mary, they learn to stand at the foot of the
  Cross, offering to the Father the sacrifice of Christ and joining to it the offering of
  their own lives. With Mary, they experience the joy of the Resurrection, making their own
  the words of the Magnificat which extol the inexhaustible gift of divine mercy in the
  inexorable flow of time: &quot;His mercy is from age to age upon those who fear him&quot;
  (<i>Lk</i> 1:50). <u><font color="#FF0000">From Sunday to Sunday, the pilgrim people
  follow in the footsteps of Mary, and her maternal intercession gives special power</font></u>
  and fervour to the prayer which rises from the Church to the Most Holy Trinity. </p>
  <p><a name="s87"></a>87. Dear Brothers and Sisters, the imminence of the Jubilee invites
  us to a deeper spiritual and pastoral commitment. Indeed, this is its true purpose. In the
  Jubilee year, much will be done to give it the particular stamp demanded by the ending of
  the Second Millennium and the beginning of the Third since the Incarnation of the Word of
  God. But this year and this special time will pass, as we look to other jubilees and other
  solemn events. As the weekly &quot;solemnity&quot;, however, Sunday will continue to shape
  the time of the Church's pilgrimage, until that Sunday which will know no evening. </p>
  <p>Therefore, dear Brother Bishops and Priests, I urge you to work tirelessly with the
  faithful to ensure that the value of this sacred day is understood and lived ever more
  deeply. This will bear rich fruit in Christian communities, and will not fail to have a
  positive influence on civil society as a whole. </p>
  <p>In coming to know the Church, which every Sunday joyfully celebrates the mystery from
  which she draws her life, may the men and women of the Third Millennium come to know the
  Risen Christ. And constantly renewed by the weekly commemoration of Easter, may Christ's
  disciples be ever more credible in proclaiming the Gospel of salvation and ever more
  effective in building the civilization of love. </p>
  <p>My blessing to you all! </p>
