</center></strong>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Revelation is the only book of the Bible that specifically mentions a 
  period of one thousand years, or millennium, in connection with the end of 
  time. It is first mentioned in Chapter 20-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the 
    bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<br>
    Rev 20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the 
    Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,<br>
    Rev 20:3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a 
    seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand 
    years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So at the very beginning of the 1000 years Satan will be restrained, or 
  bound, unable to deceive anyone for the entire period. </p>
  <p>Let's back up a little and see what immediately precedes the millennium-
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that 
    sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth 
    judge and make war.<br>
    Rev 19:12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many 
    crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.<br>
    Rev 19:13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is 
    called The Word of God.<br>
    Rev 19:14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white 
    horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.<br>
    Rev 19:15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should 
    smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he 
    treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.<br>
    Rev 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING 
    OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is an unmistakable description of the second coming of Jesus Christ as 
  the KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. Look what is described as happening at 
  the second coming-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 19:17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a 
    loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come 
    and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;<br>
    Rev 19:18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and 
    the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on 
    them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.<br>
    Rev 19:19 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, 
    gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against 
    his army.<br>
    Rev 19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that 
    wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received 
    the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were 
    cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.<br>
    Rev 19:21 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the 
    horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled 
    with their flesh.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This describes all the wicked of the earth being slain at the second 
  coming, and the destruction of the beast and false prophet. This event is also 
  mentioned elsewhere in scripture as follows-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall 
    consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness 
    of his coming:<br>
    (This was the beast of Rev 19:20)</p>
    <p>2 Th 2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all 
    power and signs and lying wonders,<br>
    (This was the false prophet of Rev 19:20) </p>
    <p>2 Th 2:10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that 
    perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be 
    saved.<br>
    2 Th 2:11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they 
    should believe a lie:<br>
    2 Th 2:12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had 
    pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>
    (This was the rest of the wicked, who loved not the truth, the remnant of 
    Rev 19:21) </p>
    <p>Psa 37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall 
    be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume 
    away. </p>
    <p>Psa 46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his 
    voice, the earth melted.<br>
    Psa 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. 
    Selah.<br>
    Psa 46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made 
    in the earth. </p>
    <p>Psa 110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the 
    day of his wrath.<br>
    Psa 110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with 
    the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries. </p>
    <p>Isa 13:6 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a 
    destruction from the Almighty.<br>
    Isa 13:7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall 
    melt:<br>
    Isa 13:8 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of 
    them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed 
    one at another; their faces shall be as flames.<br>
    Isa 13:9 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and 
    fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners 
    thereof out of it. </p>
    <p>Isa 24:1 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, 
    and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.<br>
    Isa 24:2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with 
    the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as 
    with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the 
    borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.<br>
    Isa 24:3 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the 
    LORD hath spoken this word.<br>
    Isa 24:4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and 
    fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.<br>
    Isa 24:5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because 
    they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the 
    everlasting covenant.<br>
    Isa 24:6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell 
    therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and 
    few men left. </p>
    <p>Isa 66:15 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his 
    chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke 
    with flames of fire.<br>
    Isa 66:16 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: 
    and the slain of the LORD shall be many. </p>
    <p>Jer 4:23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and 
    the heavens, and they had no light.<br>
    Jer 4:24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills 
    moved lightly.<br>
    Jer 4:25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the 
    heavens were fled.<br>
    Jer 4:26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the 
    cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his 
    fierce anger.<br>
    Jer 4:27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet 
    will I not make a full end. </p>
    <p>Jer 25:33 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of 
    the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, 
    neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. </p>
    <p>Zep 1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver 
    them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by 
    the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all 
    them that dwell in the land. </p>
    <p>Mal 4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all 
    the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that 
    cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them 
    neither root nor branch.<br>
    Mal 4:2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise 
    with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of 
    the stall.<br>
    Mal 4:3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under 
    the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the LORD of 
    hosts. </p>
    <p>Mat 13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast 
    into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<br>
    Mat 13:48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and 
    gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.<br>
    Mat 13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come 
    forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,<br>
    Mat 13:50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be 
    wailing and gnashing of teeth. </p>
    <p>Luke 17:29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and 
    brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.<br>
    Luke 17:30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So at the second coming, all the wicked living at the time will be slain. 
  This is why Satan is restrained or bound for the 1000 years. He will have no 
  one to deceive! The world will not have a living person left on it! This was 
  also illustrated in the sanctuary service with the scapegoat-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live 
    goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and 
    all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of 
    the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the 
    wilderness:<br>
    Lev 16:22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land 
    not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The scapegoat represented Satan, put into an uninhabited land, bearing all 
  the sins of the world, which he is responsible for. </p>
  <p>So, if the wicked are all dead, the earth barren but for Satan and his 
  angels, then what of the righteous? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, 
    with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in 
    Christ shall rise first:<br>
    1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together 
    with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever 
    be with the Lord.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>First the righteous dead from all time will be raised from the grave, then 
  the righteous living will be changed, and together all the righteous from all 
  time with join with Jesus in the air. This is the rapture you hear so much 
  about. Please note that no one living is left on earth to wonder what just 
  happened. The wicked are all dead, and the righteous have met the Lord Jesus 
  Christ in the air. What happens next? Let's return to Rev 20 for the answer-
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was 
    given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the 
    witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the 
    beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their 
    foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a 
    thousand years.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The righteous will live and reign with Jesus in heaven for the period of 
  1000 years, and judge the wicked. How do I know this happens in heaven and not 
  on earth? Good question-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 14:2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I 
    would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.<br>
    John 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and 
    receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At the second coming Jesus returns to earth to gather the righteous, that 
  they may return with him to live in heaven in the mansions He has made for us.
  </p>
  <p>So for the 1000 years, the books of all the wicked dead are open and 
  available to the righteous, that they may be reviewed and judged. Now back to 
  Rev 20- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand 
    years were finished. This is the first resurrection.<br>
    Rev 20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on 
    such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of 
    Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly there are two resurrections. The first happened at the second 
  coming and consisted of the righteous from all time, and they live with God in 
  heaven for 1000 years. These people are immune from the second death, the fate 
  of the wicked. </p>
  <p>At the close of the 1000 years, Jesus and all the saints return in the New 
  Jerusalem to earth- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jude 1:14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, 
    saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,<br>
    Jude 1:15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly 
    among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and 
    of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.</p>
    <p>Zec 14:4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, 
    which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave 
    in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be 
    a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, 
    and half of it toward the south. </p>
    <p>Rev 20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed 
    out of his prison, </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>How is Satan loosed at the end of the 1000 years? There is the second 
  resurrection at the end of the of the 1000 years of all the wicked of the 
  world, to ultimately face the execution of judgment, and perish in the second 
  death. Satan again has wicked people to deceive! And what does Satan do when 
  he is loosed?-</p>
  <p>(The New Jerusalem [Rev 3:12] with all the saints inside, will have come to 
  rest in the newly formed valley caused by the splitting of the mount of 
  Olives.) </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed 
    out of his prison,<br>
    Rev 20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four 
    quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the 
    number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<br>
    Rev 20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the 
    camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God 
    out of heaven, and devoured them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Satan will lead the wicked in assaulting the New Jerusalem, in the final 
  battle of Armageddon, but he will not succeed in taking the city. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the 
    books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: 
    and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the 
    books, according to their works.<br>
    Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell 
    (the grave) delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged 
    every man according to their works.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that the dead are being judged by their works? This is speaking of 
  the spiritually dead, being judged by their works, since they lacked a saving 
  faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 14:11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall 
    bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.<br>
    Rom 14:12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At this time even the wicked will acknowledge the righteousness of God's 
  judgment regarding them and confess him as God. With the conclusion of the 
  &quot;Great White throne judgment of the wicked&quot; the sentence of the second death 
  is carried out upon the wicked- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire 
    and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be 
    tormented day and night for ever and ever.<br>
    Rev 20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the 
    second death.<br>
    Rev 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast 
    into the lake of fire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>After Satan is cast into the lake of fire, he will exist no more.<br>
  After death is cast into the lake of fire, it will exist no more.<br>
  After hell (the grave) is cast into the lake of fire, it will exist no more.<br>
  After the wicked are cast into the lake of fire, they will exist no more.<br>
  That is the second death. Non-existance, or obliteration.</p>
  <p>Oh, but you say, verse 10 says torment for ever and ever not obliteration. 
  The word translated as forever in this verse is listed in Strong's as follows-
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>65. aion, ahee-ohn'; from the same as G104; prop. an age; by extens. 
    perpetuity (also past); by impl. the world; spec. (Jewish) a Messianic 
    period (present or future):--age, course, eternal, (for) ever (-more), 
    [n-]ever, (beginning of the, while the) world (began, without end). Comp. 
    G5550.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We get the word eon from it. Eon is used in geology to specify an 
  indeterminate period of time, an age, but an eon does have a beginning and an 
  end. It is not necessarily the eternity that Rev 20:10 would seem to indicate. 
  Need more proof? Note the following passage in Ezekiel, where Satan's fate is 
  quite clear- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone 
    was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, 
    and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the 
    workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day 
    that thou wast created.<br>
    Ezek 28:14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee 
    so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in 
    the midst of the stones of fire.<br>
    Ezek 28:15 Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast 
    created, till iniquity was found in thee.<br>
    Ezek 28:16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of 
    thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as 
    profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering 
    cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.<br>
    Ezek 28:17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast 
    corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the 
    ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.<br>
    Ezek 28:18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine 
    iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a 
    fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to 
    ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.<br>
    Ezek 28:19 All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at 
    thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This passage relates the fate of Satan, to be consumed by fire and reduced 
  to ashes, and he shall never be any more. This happens in the lake of fire of 
  Revelation 20. So clearly, Hell as taught by the Roman Catholic Church, and 
  most of Christianity does not exist. Satan will not rule in a place called 
  Hell, he will be destroyed by God and so will all the wicked! </p>
  <p>And then what? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and 
    the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.<br>
    Rev 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God 
    out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br>
    Rev 21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the 
    tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall 
    be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.<br>
    Rev 21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall 
    be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any 
    more pain: for the former things are passed away.<br>
    Rev 21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things 
    new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The earth made new will be the dwelling place of God and His people for 
  eternity! </p>
  <p>So, as a result of this study, it should be clear that anyone who advocates 
  that Jesus will reign on this earth for the millennium, and that the rapture 
  will leave living people on the earth to endure seven years of tribulation / 
  antichrist, have no case. Scripture clearly describes a barren desolate planet 
  after the rapture of the church, where the wicked dead are left unburied and 
  Satan is left to contemplate his rebellion against God for 1000 years. That IS 
  the Biblical truth about the millennium that so very few churches teach today.
