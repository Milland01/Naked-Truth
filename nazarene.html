Proof of Catholic Tradition?</font></b></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
    be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a
    Nazarene.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is a verse that Roman Catholics are likely to quote in an effort to
  support Tradition. Where is the Old Testament scripture that makes this
  prophecy?... they will ask. See! This confirms the validity of Tradition since
  this prophecy was NEVER recorded by the Old Testament!... they will say. An
  ironclad example of Catholic Tradition in action?</p>
  <p>But it was ultimately recorded in scripture wasn't it? Matthew recorded it
  in his Gospel and that is sufficient to validate that there was a prophecy,
  and that it was fulfilled by Jesus. Try doing that with any Roman Catholic
  Traditions! But that is not all-</p>
  <p>From Holman's Bible Dictionary-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>NAZARETH, NAZARENE - Place name meaning, &quot;branch.&quot; Nazareth did
    not enjoy a place of prominence until its association with Jesus. It does
    not appear in the Old Testament.</p>
    <p>Holman's Bible Dictionary for Windows, version 1.0g, copyright Parson's
    Technology, 1994.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From Smith's Bible Dictionary-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>NAZARENE - an inhabitant of Nazareth. This appellative is applied to
    Jesus in many passages in the New Testament. This name, made striking in so
    many ways, and which, if first given in scorn, was adopted and glorified in
    by the disciples, we are told in Matt. 2:23 posesses a prophetic
    significance. Its application to Jesus, in consequence of the providential
    arrangements by which his parents were led to take up their abode in
    Nazareth, was the filling out of the predictions in which the promised
    Messiah is described as <em>a netser, i.e. a shoot, sprout,</em> of Jesse, a
    humble and despised descendant of the decayed royal family. Once, Acts 24:5,
    the term <em>Nazarene</em> is applied to the followers of Jesus by way of
    contempt. The name still exists in Arabic as the ordinary designation of
    Christians.</p>
    <p>Dictionary of the Bible, by William Smith, L.L.D., published by Thomas
    Nelson Publishers, copyright 1986, ISBN 0-8407-3085-3.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The word for Nazarene is thought to be derived from-</p>
  <p>5342. netser, nay'-tser; from H5341 in the sense of greenness as a striking
  color; a shoot: fig. a descendant:--branch.</p>
  <p>Far from being a recent discovery, this apparent relationship between
  netser and Nazareth was proposed by Eusebius' (260-341 A.D.) Onomasticon and
  Jerome's (345-420 A.D.) Ad Marcellam, Epist. 46:</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center">From Jerome's Letter XLVI,<br>
  PAULA AND EUSTOCHIUM TO MARCELLA,<br>
  Paragraph 13:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If only you will come, we shall go to see Nazareth, as its name denotes,
    the flower of Galilee.</p>
  </blockquote>

  Epistle 46 </a></b>online at Christian Classics Ethereal Library, Wheaton
  college.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>So even early church fathers 1500 years ago were familiar with it.</p>
  <p>So the place name Nazareth means branch, isn't that interesting ... well
  note these prophetic verses-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 11:1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
    Branch shall grow out of his roots:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The same Hebrew word &quot;netser&quot; (H5342) that the word Nazarene is
  thought to be derived from, appears in the above verse and is translated
  &quot;Branch&quot;.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 23:5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto
    David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall
    execute judgment and justice in the earth.<br>
    Jer 23:6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely:
    and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</p>
    <p>Jer 33:15 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
    righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and
    righteousness in the land.<br>
    Jer 33:16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell
    safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our
    righteousness.</p>
    <p>Zec 3:8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
    sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring
    forth my servant the BRANCH.</p>
    <p>Zec 6:12 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
    saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of
    his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Each of the above verses is well recogized as a Messianic prophecy, with
  Jesus being the Branch in each case. I am sure Matthew was well aware of these
  scriptures, and the meaning of the name Nazareth, which made the association
  clear to Matthew. Can this be mere coincidence? In my personal opinion, no. It
  has every indication of a precise fulfillment of scripture. So who now wants
  to make a case for Tradition from Matthew 2:23 by doubting that the three
  different prophets and five different verses are the very ones that Matthew is
  referring to?</p>
  <p>Which is more likely, a precisely fulfilled and <em>scriptural</em> Old
  Testament prophecy, or Catholic Tradition?</p>
