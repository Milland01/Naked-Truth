  <hr>
  <p align="left">At the invitation of Joao Machado, a Roman Catholic, the

  <p>God's Ten Commandments did <u>not</u> change from the Old Testament to the 
  New Testament. Their presence on tables of stone in the Ark of the Covenant, 
  in the Holy of Holies of the Hebrew Tabernacle, shows they are the standard by

  <p>So the statement is being made that the change from Sabbath to Sunday was a 
  non-issue until about 1750 A.D., but this is easily proved to be an erroneous 
  assertion.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF2-14/2ancyra/Laocns.htm">
    Council of Laodicea</a> in Phrygia Pacatiana, 343-381 A.D., in its 29th 
    canon, anathematized (cursed) those who kept the Saturday Sabbath rather 
    than Sunday.</li>
    <li><strong style="font-weight: 400">Pope Gregory I the Great, 590–604 A.D., 
    was so annoyed by preachers of Saturday Sabbath-keeping that he
    <a href="gregory1.html">condemned them as Antichrist.
    </a></strong></li>
    <li>Pope Eugene IV (1431-1447), also perturbed by Saturday Sabbath keepers, 
    declared that they could not be saved in his Papal Bull <i>
    <a href="cantate.html">Cantate Domino,</a></i> dated 
    February 4th, 1442.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Clearly those who taught and kept the seventh day (Saturday) Sabbath have 
  been a persistent problem for the Catholic Church from its beginning.</p>

        note, that Christian Sabbath worship recently started in a country 
        completely isolated from the resources of the Christian History. With 
        the Bible as the only source of ecclesial education and maybe a couple 
        of self proclaimed prophets, certain denominations started to form

  <p>The change from Sabbath to Sunday was indeed an issue discussed by the 
  reformers of the 16th century:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... They (those who assert church authority) also refer to the example of 
    the Apostles, who commanded to abstain from blood and from things strangled, 
    Acts 15, 29. They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the 
    Lord's Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it seems. Neither is there any 
    example whereof they make more than concerning the changing of the 
    Sabbath-day. Great, say they, is the power of the Church, since it has 
    dispensed with one of the Ten Commandments!</p>

        But keep in mind there have always been groups within Christianity that 
        have kept the Sabbath and Sunday together. In many non-Catholic 
        Christian groups, Sunday is seen as the Sabbath, but the Catholic 
        Church, Latin and Eastern Rites see the Sabbath has never changed, it is 
        still the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the week. </font></b></td>

  </div>
  <p>Well, there certainly is no biblical support for making Sunday a Sabbath 
  day, since no where does the New Testament declare the first day of the week 
  to be the new Sabbath, nor does it set forth any rules or penalties regarding 
  keeping or profaning Sunday. See: <a href="notsun.html">
  Sunday is NOT the Sabbath</a>. So the Catholic Church would be quite correct 
  in maintaining that the Sabbath day was and still is Saturday, the seventh 
  day, not Sunday, the first day of the week. Yet even the Catholic Church 
  attempts to transfer the Sabbath rest to Sunday. See
  <a href="http://198.62.75.12/www1/CDHN/comm2.html#DAY">Catechism of the 
  Catholic Church #2185</a>.</p>

  that the phrase &quot;the Lord's day&quot; in Revelation 1:10 meant Sunday. See:

  on the eighth day when cleansing is completed. It is nonsense to assert that 
  this &quot;eighth day&quot; was a Sunday. Since a man might suffer this defilement on 
  any day of the week, the offering made the eighth day (after cleansing for 
  seven days) could also be any day of the week.</p>

  <p>Leviticus 23:34-43 speaks about the Feast of Tabernacles, which begins on 
  the 15th day of Tishri, and extends for 8 days. Since the months begin with 
  the sighting of the new moon, which could be any day of the week, so the first 
  day, and eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles could be on any day of the 
  week. Only someone <u>totally unfamiliar</u> with the Hebrew calendar and the 
  biblical festivals could assert that the first day in Lev. 23:35 and the 
  eighth day in Lev. 23:36 refer to Sundays.</p>

  <p>Note the severity of the punishment mentioned for profaning the seventh day 
  Sabbath, which is holy to the Lord! Note also that keeping the seventh day 
  Sabbath is a sign between God and His people, a&nbsp; perpetual covenant, an 
  acknowledgment by His people that He is the true creator God. Where does the 
  New Testament transfer this to Sunday? It doesn't. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that

  <p>Does God bless and sanctify the first day of the week as a holy day, a day 
  of rest? No, not in the Bible. Saturday, the seventh day of the week is holy 
  to the Lord, Saturday is truly the Lord's day, and he asks us to Remember it 
  to keep it holy.</p>

        work, and the Torah contains a number of specific laws about it. There 
        are Christians who believe that they are not only obligated to keep the 
        Sabbath, they also interpret it as a commandment to attend church. The 
        problem is that if they drive a car to church, they have broken the 
        Sabbath to keep it, because driving a car involves igniting an internal 
        combustion engine, which violates the law against starting a fire on the 
        Sabbath!</font><span style="font-style: normal"><font size="2"> </font>

  <p>In a similar manner, the Pharisees accused Jesus and His disciples of 
  breaking the Sabbath by picking and eating grain as they walked through a 
  field (Matt 12:1-8, Mark 2:23-28, Luke 6:1-5).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath 
    of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath 
    of the LORD in all your dwellings.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since the seventh day Sabbath is declared by God to be a convocation day, 
  the people of God are <i>commanded</i> to assemble on that day for worship. 
  Starting your car to attend church on the Sabbath is perfectly permissible, 
  and is in the same category as David and his men eating the showbread, which 
  is to say there is <i>nothing</i> wrong with it. The Pharisee, however, seeks 
  to make the Sabbath a burden on people, rather than a delight. </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that in answer to the question regarding eternal life, Jesus omits 
  those commandments dealing with worship of God. Can we logically conclude that 
  because of its omission the commandment regarding worship of other gods (Exo. 
  20:3) had been abolished? No, it would be foolish to assume that. Had the 
  commandment against bowing down before idols (Exo. 20:4-5) also been 
  abolished? No. Had the commandment forbidding taking the name of God in vain (Exo. 
  20:7) been abolished? No. It is absurd to conclude these commandments were 
  abolished by Jesus simply because He did not mention them. How can anyone 
  conclude, then, that the one commandment that calls us to <i>remember the 
  sabbath day to keep it holy</i> is not included when Jesus said, in answer to 
  the question <font color="#FF0000">&quot;if thou wilt enter into life, keep the 
  commandments.&quot; </font>Surely it <i>was</i> included implicitly as a 
  commandment to be kept, therefore Jesus <u>did</u> teach the keeping of the 
  seventh day Sabbath when He said <font color="#FF0000">&quot;keep the 
  commandments.&quot;</font></p>
  <p>See: <a href="covenant-seal.html">The Seal of God in 
  the Old and New Covenants.</a></p>
  <p>Jesus also taught this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 5:18 <font color="#FF0000">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and 
    earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till 
    all be fulfilled.</font><br>
    Mat 5:19 <font color="#FF0000">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these 
    least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in 
    the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall 
    be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Yet the Catholic Church would have us believe that they have abolished one 
  of the Ten Commandments of God, and replaced it with a Tradition of men?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 15:8 <font color="#FF0000">This people draweth nigh unto me with 
    their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from

  <p>That John means Sunday in Revelation 1:10 is nothing but pure speculation. 
  While Sunday has become known through Tradition as the Lord's day, scripture 
  does not designate it as such, but we can find the following, referring to the 
  Saturday Sabbath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 12:8 <font color="#ff0000">For the Son of man is Lord even of the 
    sabbath day.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 2:28 <font color="#ff0000">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of 
    the sabbath.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 6:5 And he said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">That the Son of man 
    is Lord also of the sabbath.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the above verses it is quite clear that Jesus Christ is the Lord of the 
  Sabbath day, referring to the biblical sabbath, the sabbath instituted at 
  creation and written on tables of stone by the finger of God (Exo. 20:8-11). 
  The only day of the week John would have considered to be &quot;the Lord's day&quot; was 
  not Sunday, but the biblical seventh day Saturday Sabbath spoken of by Jesus 
  Himself.</p>

  holy day, ... the holy of the LORD&quot;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Isa 58:12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old 
    waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and 
    thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to

    Isa 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy 
    pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the 
    LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor 
    finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:<br>
    Isa 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee 
    to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage 
    of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Clearly, <u>the Lord's Holy Day</u> is the seventh day 
  (Saturday) Sabbath! The mouth of the LORD has spoken it!</p>
  <p align="left"><b>Conclusion:</b> The substitution of Sunday for the seventh 
  day Sabbath has no biblical warrant, it is not taught in scripture. Neither 
  does scripture call the first day of the week &quot;the eighth day&quot; or &quot;the Lord's 
  day.&quot;</p>
