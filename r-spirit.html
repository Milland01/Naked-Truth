to my article on <a href="prison.html">Limbo&nbsp; and The Apostle's Creed</a></font></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><b><u>Mario's thesis:</u></b></p>
  <p>Departed Christians and Old Testament saints are really alive, and not just
  asleep in the grave until Christ raises their bodies up again.</p>
  <p><b><u>Satan's lie:</u></b></p>
  <p>Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:<br>
  Gen 3:5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
  be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Matthew 17:1-5</u></b></p>
  <p>Mario suggests that this passage proves that the righteous dead go
  immediately to heaven:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now, this was kind of difficult for Moses and Elijah if they were
    &quot;dead&quot; in their graves, as Michael Scheifler claims, still waiting
    to come to life again through Christ Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As most any student of the Bible knows, Elijah never died. He was taken up
  into heaven in a chariot of fire <nobr>(2 Kings 2:11)</nobr>, so he is hardly
  proof of the state of the dead. Moses on the other hand surely did die and was
  buried (Deut 34:5,6), but his later bodily resurrection is plainly alluded to
  in Jude 9. The point being that Moses did <em>not</em> go heaven immediately 
  upon his death, but rather he was later <i>raised from the dead</i> so he 
  could be present at the transfiguration of Jesus. </p>
  <p>In his revised rebuttal, Mario concedes that since Elijah never died, he
  cannot be used to prove the state of the dead. Now, using Acts 26:23, Mario
  proposes that Jesus was the very first to have ever been resurrected from the
  dead. Here is his statement:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If what Mike said is true, then we would have to conclude that Moses was
    resurrected before Christ died on the Cross. However, Jesus is the first one
    to ever have risen <nobr>(Acts 26:23),</nobr> and therefore Moses'
    Resurrection must have occurred after Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross. Thus,
    Moses showed up with Elijah while he was not yet resurrected, so that proves
    the Catholic point, because Moses cannot be sleeping and showing up at the
    Transfiguration at the same time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A simple review of scripture shows that Jesus was clearly not the first to
  be resurrected as Mario claims:
  <ul>
    <li>Elijah raises the son of the widow woman - 1 Kings 17:17-22</li>
    <li>Elisha raises the son of the Shunammite woman - 2 Kings 4:32-35</li>
    <li>The bones of Elisha raises a man - 2 Kings 13:21</li>
    <li>Jesus raises Lazarus - John 11:1-45</li>
    <li>Jesus raises the widows son - Luke 7:12-16</li>
    <li>Jesus raises the daughter of Jarius - Luke 8:49-56</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that these resurrections from the dead all happened prior to the
  resurrection of Jesus. So is Acts 26:23 in error?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 26:23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first
    that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto the people, and
    to the Gentiles.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since Jesus was <em>not</em> the first to be raised from the dead, (Moses 
  was, as pointed out above) how does
  one interpret this verse? Clearly it means Jesus was the first in preeminence to be
  resurrected, or the first in importance, but not the first in chronological
  sequence. This is supported by the meaning of the Greek word translated as
  &quot;first&quot; as defined in Strong's:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>G4413. protos, pro'-tos; contr. superl. of G4253; foremost (in time,
    place, order or importance): --before, beginning, best, chief (-est), first
    (of all), former.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Moses in Jude 9 was apparently the first person to be raised from the
  dead, in chronology, and this is why he was able to appear at the
  transfiguration of Jesus, who shortly thereafter was the most preeminent
  (first in importance among men) to ever be resurrected, as indicated in Acts
  26:23.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Mark 12:19-27</u></b></p>
  <p>Jesus is asked by the Sadducees (who did not believe in a resurrection) a
  hypothetical case of a woman who has seven consecutive brothers as husbands:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
    resurrection; and they asked him, saying,<br>
    Mark 12:19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave
    his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his
    wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<br>
    Mark 12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
    dying left no seed.<br>
    Mark 12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and
    the third likewise.<br>
    Mark 12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
    died also.<br>
    Mark 12:23 <strong>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise</strong>,
    whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.<br>
    Mark 12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Do ye
    not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of
    God?</font><br>
    Mark 12:25 <font color="#FF0000">For <strong>when they shall rise from the
    dead</strong>, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the
    angels which are in heaven.</font><br>
    Mark 12:26 <font color="#FF0000"><strong>And as touching the dead, that they
    rise</strong>: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God
    spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
    the God of Jacob?</font><br>
    Mark 12:27 <font color="#FF0000">He is not the God of the dead, but the God
    of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that both the question of the Sadducees, and the answer Jesus gives,
  deal with <i>after</i> the resurrection? If as Catholicism (and much of
  Christianity) teaches, people went immediately to heaven after death, then the
  focus of the conversation would have been on the recent dead, not those who
  are<i> resurrected</i> from death at some point in the future. Note that Jesus
  rebukes the Sadducees for not knowing the teaching of scripture, or the power
  of God with respect to raising the dead. Jesus is affirming to the Sadducees
  that there will indeed be a resurrection from death, that there is victory
  over the grave!</p>
  <p>Verse 26, however, does not prove that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive
  in heaven, but rather, because of their faith, they will indeed be resurrected
  and then be rewarded with eternal life, something the Sadducees rejected (v.
  18). Note that Jesus begins verse 26 with - <i>and as touching the dead, that
  they rise</i> - Jesus then goes on to present Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as
  prime examples of those who will be raised from the dead, despite the false
  beliefs of the Sadducees. The Sadducees rejected the resurrection from the
  dead, and Jesus in verse 27 is saying that God will not be the God of the dead
  and buried, but the God of the living, the resurrected, as he makes clear at
  the beginning of verse 26.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Luke 15:7</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 15:7 <font color="#FF0000">I say unto you, that likewise joy shall
    be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine
    just persons, which need no repentance.</font></p>
    <p>Mario comments:</p>
    <p>This, too, is rather difficult to do if there is no one in Heaven right
    now, as &quot;Mr. Bible Light&quot; claims.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>First, I make no such claim that no one is in Heaven. <nobr>Enoch (Gen
  5:24),</nobr> <nobr>Moses (Matt 17:3, Jude 9) </nobr>and <nobr>Elijah (2
  Kings:11)</nobr> are clearly in heaven, in addition to 24 elders <nobr>(Rev
  5:8),</nobr> which are probably some of the saints mentioned as resurrected
  from the dead in Matthew 27:52. But then heaven is also full of the heavenly
  host of angels, who needless to say, rejoice at one sinner repenting. As a
  result, Luke 15:7 does absolutely nothing to prove the state of the dead one
  way or another.</p>
  <p>In his revised rebuttal, Mario concedes that Luke 15:7 proves nothing about
  the state of the dead.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Matthew 27:52</u></b></p>
  <p>In his revised rebuttal Mario points to Matthew 27:52 as &quot;proof&quot;
  of Catholic teaching:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... what are those elders doing in Heaven? Aren't they &quot;asleep&quot;
    in their grace, waiting to be resurrected on the Last Day? Indeed, Matthew
    27:52 completely refutes SDA thinking. It reads, &quot;...the bodies of many
    saints who had fallen asleep were raised.&quot; See, this is just what
    Catholicism teaches. When Jesus died, all those who had died in a state of
    grace from the Old Testament were resurrected and went to Heaven, and from
    that time on (Jesus' own Resurrection), anyone who died in a state of grace
    could go to Heaven immediately.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I have already pointed to six other instances of resurrections that
  occurred before that of Jesus (seven if you include Moses). But, just as Moses
  was taken up to heaven at his resurrection, so probably were the many saints
  after Jesus was resurrected. These saints were not held alive in some place
  called Sheol, but dead and buried, dust, before their resurrection. They were
  taken to heaven to demonstrate Christ's absolute power over death. Catholicism
  does <em>not</em> teach a general bodily resurrection of all the righteous
  dead at Jesus' resurrection, contrary to Mario's claim and one need only to
  read his later quote from the Vatican Catechism to verify this.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If SDA were true, then those saints in Mt 27:52 could not have been
    raised, but would have had to wait in their graves till Christ pronounces
    judgment upon the earth on the Last Day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The saints raised from the dead in Matthew 27:52 are firstfruits of the
  resurrection from the dead, and are already in heaven to demonstrate what the
  rest of us have to look forward to. Though we may die, and be buried, we will
  surely be resurrected as they were, and join them in heaven, but for us that
  will not happen until the second coming. Until then, our death will be like a
  sleep in the grave. So Matthew 27:52 does not present any contradiction or
  problem, nor does it validate Roman Catholic teaching on the state of the
  dead.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Luke 16:19-24</u></b></p>
  <p>Many will try to use Luke 16:19-31 as proof that there is conscious life
  after death, and that there is a place of eternal torment (Hell). It is
  important to point out that Luke 16:19-31 is the fifth in a series of parables
  as follows:
  <ul>
    <p>1. The lost sheep - Luke 15:3-7<br>
    2. The lost coin - Luke 15:8-10<br>
    3. The lost boy - Luke 15:11-32<br>
    4. The unjust steward - Luke 16:1-13<br>
    5. The rich man and Lazarus - Luke 16:19-31</p>
  </ul>
  <p>Parables are designed to teach great moral principles. Each feature of the
  parable is not to be taken absolutely literally. The question in each parable
  is what are the great moral lessons. We get into deep trouble if we attempt to
  take each detail of the parable literally rather than seek the lesson that
  Jesus is trying to teach. Let's go ahead and assume for a moment that the
  parable of the rich man and Lazarus is a literally true story-
  <ul>
    <li>Do people actually have conversations between Heaven and Hell?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Can those in heaven see people burning in Hell?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Can they hear their screams?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Would a finger dipped in water actually lessen the torment of another?<br>
    </li>
    <li>Abraham must have a very large bosom to contain all the individuals who
      go there!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Heaven would be a terrible place if we beheld the constant, ever present
  suffering of our friends for all of eternity. So, why did Jesus use this story
  and tell it as He did? What lesson(s) was He trying to teach?</p>
  <p>The Jews had a common story describing death as passing through a valley of
  darkness and they pictured salvation as fleeing to the security of Abraham's
  bosom. The Jews also believed that riches were a sign of God's favor and
  poverty a sign of His displeasure. Surely the poverty of Lazarus was an
  indication he had committed some grave sin, the Jews thought. But, the rich
  man in the story, whom the Jews thought blessed of God, ends up in Hell, while
  the poor man is in heaven. Jesus had reversed the outcome from what the Jews
  expected. This is why Jesus used the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in
  the way he did. It was not intended to convey the exact circumstances of
  Heaven or Hell, but rather to show to the Jews that they had grave
  misconceptions about who was saved and who was lost.</p>
  <p>These are the main points the parable teaches:</p>
  <p>1. Riches gained by greed, dishonesty or oppressing the poor are not a sign
  of God's favor. Wealth is simply not an indicator of one's salvation.</p>
  <p>2. The parable describes a great fixed gulf between the saved and the lost.
  Jesus clearly communicated that there is no second chance after death. The
  decision made in life determines our eternal destiny, and it simply cannot be
  changed after death.</p>
  <p>3. Jesus points out that if the Pharisees rejected the clear teachings of
  God's word regarding salvation, they would also reject such a mighty,
  supernatural spectacular miracle as one being raised from the dead.</p>
  <p>Note that a short while later in John 11:11-14, 43, 44 Jesus raised Lazarus
  from the dead. As a result the Jews were threatened and attempted to kill
  Lazarus (John 12:10). They also became so angry with Jesus that they plotted
  to destroy Him as well. So the words of Jesus in Luke 16:31 were indeed
  prophetic and fulfilled.</p>
  <p>So parables are not meant to be taken literally as written. You must read
  beyond the literal text to see the important principle or lesson(s) being
  taught.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Acts 2:29-34</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
    David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto
    this day.<br>
    Acts 2:30 Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an
    oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he
    would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;<br>
    Acts 2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that
    his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.<br>
    Acts 2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we are all witnesses.<br>
    Acts 2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
    received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth
    this, which ye now see and hear.<br>
    Acts 2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,
    The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<br>
    Acts 2:35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.<br>
    Acts 3:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
    hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Please note that David is <i>not</i> in heaven (not even in some alleged
  spirit form). According to verse 34, he is still dead, still in the grave.
  While he was living, David spoke of the resurrection of Jesus, that Jesus
  would not be left in the grave (hell), but rather, God would raise Jesus from
  the dead and He would be exalted as Lord and Christ. It is this victory over
  death and the grave that Jesus Christ offers us if we will have faith in Him.
  But this reward is something we receive <i>after</i> our resurrection, not
  before:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:12 <font color="#FF0000">And behold, I come quickly; and my reward
    is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</font><br>
    Rev 22:13 <font color="#FF0000">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
    end, the first and the last.</font><br>
    Rev 22:14 <font color="#FF0000">Blessed are they that do his commandments,
    that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the
    gates into the city.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We do not get access to the tree of life and live forever until after the
  second coming, at which time the righteous will be resurrected, and enter the
  New Jerusalem. That is when we will be given the opportunity to eat from the
  tree of life.</p>
  <p><b><u>On 1 Peter 4:1-6</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
    yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the
    flesh hath ceased from sin;<br>
    1 Pet 4:2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to
    the lusts of men, but to the will of God.<br>
    1 Pet 4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the
    will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of
    wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:<br>
    1 Pet 4:4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run riot, speaking evil of
    you:<br>
    1 Pet 4:5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and
    the dead.<br>
    1 Pet 4:6 For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead,
    that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according
    to God in the spirit.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This does not speak of preaching to dead people in the grave in the
  physical sense. In context it is speaking of preaching to the Gentiles, the
  unbelievers, the spiritually dead, that they too might hear and believe the
  Gospel message. Another example of this is found in the book of John:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 5:25 <font color="#FF0000">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour
    is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God:
    and they that hear shall live.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At the time, Jesus was speaking of those people hearing His voice at that
  instant. Those that were spiritually dead in the crowd that heard and believed
  Him, would inherit eternal life. This is exactly what 1 Peter 4:6 is saying as
  well. Until the resurrection, however, those in the grave hear nothing and do
  nothing:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eccl 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
    any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is
    forgotten.</p>
    <p>Eccl 9:10 Whatsover thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
    there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
    whither thou goest.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The time is indeed coming, however, when Jesus will speak to those dead in
  their graves:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 5:28 <font color="#FF0000">Marvel not at this: for the hour is
    coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</font><br>
    John 5:29 <font color="#FF0000">And shall come forth; they that have done
    good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
    resurrection of damnation.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="100">
  <p>From the above Bible verses quoted by Mario, it should be apparent that
  there is nothing that supports the state of the dead as taught by the Catholic
  Church (and most of Christianity for that matter). So Mario's assertion that
  he has clarified the issue in these few verses is quite groundless.</p>
  <p>The rest of his rebuttal goes on to assert that &quot;paradise&quot; was
  previously located in &quot;hell&quot; and was relocated after Jesus'
  ascension to heaven and that &quot;sheol&quot; was the destination for Old
  Testament saints who were released from there at the time of Jesus'
  resurrection. This is nothing but pure invention, fable, something that is not
  taught by the Bible. And the Apostle's Creed and the quote from the Catholic
  Catechism prove absolutely nothing. They are merely the tradition of men.</p>
  <p>Mario is more than a little confused about my position and frequently
  misrepresents what I have said and what I believe. He needs to read more
  carefully before beginning a rebuttal. For further clarification of my
  viewpoint, Jesus died on the cross, and from then until His resurrection He
  did nothing and went nowhere. He was dead. He lay in the tomb until Sunday
  when God raised Him from the grave in a glorious victory over death. Also,
  Jesus during his incarnation on Earth <em>never</em> went anywhere to preach
  to the people of Noah's time, dead or otherwise.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>Who Are The Spirits In Prison?</u></font></b></p>
  <p>Let's take a close look at this passage in 1st Peter and see just what it 
  is really saying. Verse 18 contains a parallelism, the same thought expressed 
  twice.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Pet 3:18</b> For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just 
    for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ who was sinless, died once on the cross for sinners, and was 
  resurrected&nbsp; to reconcile sinners with God, ...</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He died the death all we mortals must die, but He was raised to life by the 
  Holy Spirit. The parallelism above states twice that Christ died and was 
  resurrected.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Pet 3:19</b> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in 
    prison;<br>
    [The word translated preached G2784. kerusso, is also properly translated as 
    proclaim. See Rev 5:2. So it does not necessarily refer to preaching the 
    gospel.]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Verse 19 says that in His resurrected state (By which), Christ went and 
  proclaimed his victory over the spirits in prison. So who are these spirits? 
  Verse 22 parallels and restates verse 19:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Pet 3:22</b> Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of 
    God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The spirits in prison refers not to people, but fallen angels and 
  authorities and powers who are also spoken of as being chained:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eph 6:12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against 
    principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this 
    world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>
    <p>Col 2:15 And [by His resurrection] having spoiled principalities and 
    powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them [fallen angels] 
    in it.</p>
    <p>Rev 20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the 
    bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.<br>
    Rev 20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the 
    Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,<br>
    Rev 20:3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a 
    seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand 
    years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.<br>
    ...<br>
    Rev 20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out 
    of his prison,</p>
    <p>Jude 1:6 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their 
    own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto 
    the judgment of the great day.</p>
    <p>2 Pet 2:4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them 
    down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved 
    unto judgment;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>1 Peter 3:20 and 21 speak of Noah's experience with the flood, and Christ's 
  death and resurrection, as types of baptism, in which the sinner can gain, and 
  proclaim,&nbsp; victory over sin and death:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>1 Pet 3:20</b> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the 
    longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a 
    preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.<br>
    <b>1 Pet 3:21</b> The like figure [of death and resurrection] whereunto even 
    baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the 
    flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection 
    of Jesus Christ:</p>
    <p>Rom 6:4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like 
    as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we 
    also should walk in newness of life.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So properly understood, this passage of 1 Peter 3:18-20 does not teach that 
  Jesus preached to spirits of dead people in Hell or purgatory after His death 
  on the cross, it simply does not validate a belief in an intermediate &quot;prison&quot; 
  or limbo for immortal souls between death and heaven, as some teach today. 
  When Christ died on the cross, He was buried, and did <i>nothing</i> until His 
  resurrection. He went nowhere and preached to no one during the time period 
  between His crucifixion and resurrection. Dead is dead.</p>
