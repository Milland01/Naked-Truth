  <p>I sent the following email to Karl Keating via his forum, also on the 2nd
  of July, 1998:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dear Karl,</p>
    <p>In the interests of scholarship and accuracy, the title VICARIUS FILII
    DEI, which does add up to 666 using the values of Roman numerals, is indeed
    genuine. It appeared in the Donation of Constantine, which was held to be
    genuine by the Catholic Church for over 600 years.&nbsp; According to
    Christopher B. Coleman, who published a book* on the subject in 1922, the
    Donation was cited by at least 10 popes as proof of their temporal authority
    and also appeared in Catholic canon law (Anselm's, Cardinal Deusdedit's, and
    Gratian's <i>Decretum</i> also known as <i>Concordia Discordantium Canonum</i>).&nbsp; I
    personally have a copy of Lucius Ferraris' <i>Prompta Bibliotheca</i>, 1858 Paris
    edition, in which the title VICARIUS FILII DEI appears in volume 5, column
    1828, under &quot;PAPA&quot;, &quot;Article II.&quot; <i>Prompta Bibliotheca</i>,
    according to the 1913 <i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i>, is &quot;a veritable
    encyclopedia of religious knowledge&quot; and &quot;will ever remain a
    precious mine of information&quot; and is quoted frequently as an
    authoritative Catholic source.</p>
    <p>Will you concede, in view of the above, that the title was held to be
    genuine for the many hundreds of years that the Catholic Church defended the
    Donation of Constantine?</p>
    <p>I would also refer you to additional evidence on my web page at http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/
    and request a rebuttal from you, which I will gladly post on my web page.
    This is your opportunity to conclusively prove your assertion that VICARIUS
    FILII DEI is a fake, on an Adventist web page.</p>
    <p>Respectfully,<br>
    Michael Scheifler</p>

    <hr width="15%">
  </blockquote>
  <p>On 7 September, 1998, this second request for a rebuttal was sent to Karl
  Keating via his Apologetics forum at EWTN:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">Mr. Keating,</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">... I would like for you to clarify your statement on July
    2nd in this forum that Vicarius Filii Dei is a &quot;fake&quot; title for
    the papacy. I presented you with a challenge and documented the proof on 2
    July that the title was in fact used by the Catholic Church for well over
    600 years, to which you have not as yet responded. I invite you again to
    defend your statement and refute my documentation. If you feel you have a
    case, I am certain your readers will want to hear what it is. I will also
    post your remarks on my web page, appending it to my challenge to you at
    http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/keating.htm</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Respectfully,<br>
    Michael Scheifler</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There was no response of any kind from Mr. Keating, nor did he address my
  challenge in his forum.</p>
