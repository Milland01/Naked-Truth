<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofevangelism.org/home.cfm">Perry Stone</a> <strong style="font-weight: 400">in the early 
part of his Manna-Fest Program # 354
<a href="mms://media1.winworld.cc/voe/mannafest354.wmv">Journey to the 
Underworld Series Pt. 5 &quot;More Secrets of Paradise &quot;</a></strong><a href="http://media1.winworld.cc/media/voe/mannafest354.wmv"><strong style="font-weight: 400"> - (Direct 
Download)</strong></a> cites the Apostle Paul in 1 Thessalonians 4:14 to prove 
the dead are not really dead, they are in heaven with Jesus, and will return 
with Jesus at the rapture. Let's examine what Paul is really teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1 Th 4:13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning 
  them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>
</blockquote>

  <p>What does Paul mean by &quot;others which have no hope&quot;? This is an important 
  point I will let Paul explain:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 Cor 15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say 
  some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?<br>
  1 Cor 15:13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not 
  risen:<br>
  1 Cor 15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your 
  faith is also vain.<br>
  1 Cor 15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have 
  testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be 
  that the dead rise not.<br>
  1 Cor 15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:<br>
  1 Cor 15:17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in 
  your sins.<br>
  1 Cor 15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.<br>
  1 Cor 15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men 
  most miserable.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You see, there were some who did not believe in the resurrection from the dead (see also 
  Matt. 22:23, Mark 12:18, Acts 23:8), they believed that the dead were perished forever, that 
  they were not in heaven in spirit form, they were dead. Those who believed 
  this are the &quot;others which have no hope&quot; in 1 Thess 4:13. They believed the dead were 
  eternally lost. This notion sets the context that Paul gives for 1 Thess 4:14-18. </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 Th 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also 
  which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, in what sense does Jesus <i>also</i> &quot;bring&quot; the dead with Him? Well, 
  Paul is explaining to his audience that when Jesus returns, the dead will not 
  remain dead in the grave as they suppose, they will, in fact, <i>be 
  resurrected to join the living</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 Th 4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are 
  alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are 
  asleep.<br>
  1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with 
  the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ 
  shall rise first:<br>
  1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with 
  them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with 
  the Lord.<br>
  1 Th 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The same kind of language is found in Hebrews and Ezekiel:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Heb 13:20 Now the God of peace, that <u>brought again from the dead our 
  Lord Jesus</u>, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the 
  everlasting covenant,</p>
  <p>Ezek 37:12 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; 
  Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of 
  your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.<br>
  Ezek 37:13 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your 
  graves, O my people, and <u>brought you up out of your graves</u>,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, this is how verse 14 should be understood:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>1 Th 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them 
  also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him [up out of the grave, from the dead].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Paul is dispelling the notion that some had that the dead could not be 
  saved, because they denied the possibility of resurrection. By teaching there 
  will be a resurrection from the dead, because Jesus was resurrected, Paul was comforting his audience, so 
  that they could comfort each other about the blessed hope of resurrection from 
  the dead.</p>
  <p>And just where exactly will the saints be with the Lord after the 
  resurrection?</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>John 14:1 <font color="#FF0000">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe 
  in God, believe also in me.</font><br>
  John 14:2 <font color="#FF0000">In my Father's house are many mansions: if it 
  were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</font><br>
  John 14:3 <font color="#FF0000">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I 
  will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am </font>[the 
  Father's house]<font color="#FF0000">, there ye may be 
  also.<br>
  </font>John 14:4<font color="#FF0000"> And whither I go ye know, and the way 
  ye know.<br>
  </font>John 14:5 Thomas saith unto him,<font color="#FF0000"> Lord, we know 
  not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?<br>
  </font>John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him,<font color="#FF0000"> I am the way, the 
  truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</font></p>
  <p>John 14:23 Jesus answered and said unto him,<font color="#FF0000"> If a man 
  love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we </font>
  [Jesus and His bride, the church]<font color="#FF0000"> will come unto him
  </font>[the Father]<font color="#FF0000">, and make our abode with him </font>
  [in the Father's house]<font color="#FF0000">.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John says that the Father's house is where Jesus will take the saints at 
  the second coming. So Paul in 1 Thess 4:14 is NOT saying that Jesus brings the souls of dead 
  saints from heaven back to earth at His return, rather he is telling those 
  who doubt the resurrection, that Jesus will surely resurrect the dead and 
  bring them <u> <i>and</i></u> the living righteous with Him to the Father's house, the 
  New Jerusalem. So after the resurrection,<i> then</i> they will ever be with 
  the Lord.</p>
  <p>Perry Stone's teaching that the dead are not really dead is actually 
  repeating Satan's lie in the garden of Eden:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>

  <p align="left"><a href="http://www.voiceofevangelism.org/home.cfm">Perry Stone</a> <strong style="font-weight: 400">in 
  his Manna-Fest Program # 356
  <a href="mms://media1.winworld.cc/voe/mannafest356.wmv">Rapture &amp; Law of First 
  Fruits Series Pt. 2- &quot;Controversy About the Rapture&quot;</a> - (<a href="http://media1.winworld.cc/media/voe/mannafest356.wmv">Direct 
  Download</a>) teaches that the yet future secret rapture is to be equated with 
  the firstfruits of the harvest, followed later by the main harvest (Rev 14), 
  and then the gleaning of the four corners of the field, which represents the 
  Jewish remnant. Scripture clearly contradicts this teaching. Note the 
  following:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">1 Cor 15:20 But now is Christ 
  risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.<br>
  1 Cor 15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of 
  the dead.<br>
  1 Cor 15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.<br>
  1 Cor 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward 
  they that are Christ's at his coming.<br>
  1 Cor 15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom 
  to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all 
  authority and power.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
  <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">The firstfruits of the 
  resurrection is specifically identified to be Christ Himself, nearly 2000 years ago, in 
  verses 20 and 23. Then, as verse 23 makes plain, at His second coming the 
  whole of the righteous dead in Christ are resurrected. <u>There is no future 
  secret rapture of saints taught in this passage that precedes the second 
  coming.</u></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">Now note the following 
  description of Passover, 14,15 and 16 Nisan:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">Lev 23:4 These are the feasts 
  of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.<br>
  Lev 23:5 In the fourteenth day of the first month [Nisan] at even is the 
  Lord's passover.<br>
  Lev 23:6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened 
  bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.<br>
  Lev 23:7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no 
  servile work therein [15 Nisan to be a sabbath].<br>
  Lev 23:8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: 
  in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work 
  therein.<br>
  Lev 23:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,<br>
  Lev 23:10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be 
  come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof,
  <u>then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the 
  priest:</u><br>
  Lev 23:11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: 
  on the morrow after the sabbath [16 Nisan] the priest shall wave it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
  <strong style="font-weight: 400">On 14 Nisan Jesus was 
  crucified and buried.</strong></li>
  <li>
  <strong style="font-weight: 400">On 15 Nisan, a sabbath day, 
  Jesus rested in the tomb.</strong></li>
  <li>
  <strong style="font-weight: 400">On 16 Nisan (firstfruits) 
  Jesus was resurrected, and Paul calls Him <u>the firstfruits</u>:1 Cor 15:20, 
  23.</strong></li>

</ul>
<p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly enough, note what 
happened after the crucifixion of Christ:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">Mat 27:50 Jesus, when he had 
  cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.<br>
  Mat 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top 
  to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;<br>
  Mat 27:52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which 
  slept arose,<br>
  Mat 27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the 
  holy city, and appeared unto many.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
  <p align="left"><strong style="font-weight: 400">The graves of a select group 
  of saints were opened when Christ died on 14 Nisan. This corresponds to the 
  selection of the firstfruits of the barley harvest, the first to be harvested. 
  However those saints were not resurrected until after Christ Himself was 
  raised early on 16 Nisan, the day the firstfruits sheaf was waved by the 
  priest. <i>The saints raised from the dead on 16 Nisan comprised the harvested 
  firstfruits sheaf, waved triumphantly in victory over the grave by Jesus our 
  High Priest. </i><br>
  <br>
  So, the firstfruits of the resurrection harvest happened on 16 Nisan nearly 
  two thousand years ago with Christ's resurrection. It is <i>not</i> an event 
  that awaits a future fulfillment. </strong></p>
<strong style="font-weight: 400">
  <p align="left"> In his Manna-Fest Program # 
  358, <a href="mms://media1.winworld.cc/voe/mannafest358.wmv">Rapture &amp; Law 
  of First Fruits Series Pt. 4- &quot;Harvest, First Fruits, Rain and the Rapture&quot;</a>&nbsp;- (<a href="http://media1.winworld.cc/media/voe/mannafest358.wmv">Direct 
  Download</a>), Perry refers to the Hebrew marriage customs, and briefly 
  mentions that the groom builds a chamber in his father's house. When it is completed and the time is right, the groom, a 
  symbol of Christ, escorts his bride, a symbol for the church, <i>from her 
  house to the father of the groom's house</i>, symbolic of the New Jerusalem, 
  in heaven, to the chamber He has prepared.</p>
  <p align="left"> Take note that there is only one wedding feast, for the <i>
  entire</i> bride of Christ, and those who are not prepared when the groom 
  comes for His bride will be locked out, as the parable of the ten virgins 
  demonstrates (Matt 25:1-13). There is <i>no second chanc</i>e to be included 
  in the wedding feast. </p>
  <p align="left"> So, as John 14:1-6 states, Jesus is preparing a place (for 
  His bride) in His Father's house. And when He returns, He will escort His 
  bride to the marriage feast, which will not be held at the bride's house 
  (earth), but at God the Father's house, New Jerusalem in heaven, where the 
  preparations have been made. This is where the righteous spend the millennium, 
  in heaven, not on earth:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="left"> Rev 20:4 ... and they lived and reigned <u>with Christ</u> a 
  thousand years.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Perry also briefly mentions the parable of the wheat and the 
  tares (Matt 13:24-30, 36-43). Note that according to the parable, the tares 
  (the wicked), are gathered first and burned. The wheat (the righteous) are <i>
  not</i> harvested first, leaving behind the lost unbelievers to wonder what 
  happened, as the secret rapture proponents teach. The parable teaches clearly 
  that the wicked are <i>all</i> slain at the second coming, there will not be 
  one of the wicked left alive:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p align="left">Mat 13:40 <font color="#FF0000">As therefore the tares are 
  gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</font><br>
  Mat 13:41 <font color="#FF0000">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, 
  and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them 
  which do iniquity;</font><br>
  Mat 13:42 <font color="#FF0000">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: 
  there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</font><br>
  Mat 13:43 <font color="#FF0000">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the 
  sun in the kingdom of their Father. </font></strong><font color="#FF0000">
  <strong>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</strong></font><strong></p>
  </blockquote>
</strong><strong style="font-weight: 400">
  <p align="left">Jesus directly contradicts the false secret rapture teaching,
  <i>if</i> you have ears to hear.</p>
