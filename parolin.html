  <p>Monsignor Pietro Parolin is the Vatican's undersecretary for relations with 
  states, and his comments of November 21, 2007, given at the Argentinian 
  Embassy to the Holy See, bear a striking parallel to Revelation 17. </p>
  <p>In scripture a woman is used symbolically to depict the church (2 Cor 11:2, 
  Rev 19:7,8).&nbsp; The woman of Revelation 12 is the true church, the woman of 
  Revelation 17 is the apostate church. The apostate harlot church is uniquely 
  described in Revelation 17 as riding a beast. A beast in scripture is symbolic 
  of an empire or state (Dan 7:17). Examples of this are explained in Daniel 7, 
  where a lion represented Babylon, a bear<font face="Times New Roman"> </font>
  represented Medo-Persia, and a leopard<font face="Times New Roman"> 
  represented </font>Greece. Therefore, the woman of Revelation 17 riding a 
  beast is symbolic of the combining of the ecclesiastical power of church (the 
  woman) and political power of the state (the beast), i.e., a church in control 
  of state power. </p>
  <p>Now, regarding the Holy See:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>He (Monsignor Parolin) explained that an adequate understanding of the Holy See, as such, 
    requires two distinctions. First, one must bear in mind that the Holy See 
    cannot simply be identified with the Church [woman], as a community of believers. 
    And second, it cannot be identified with Vatican City State [beast], a geographical 
    place that assures the freedom of the Roman Pontiff.</p>
  <p>“The Holy See is the Holy Father himself inasmuch as he is an 
    independent, universal, spiritual authority [woman - church], together with the organizations 
    of the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/index.htm">Roman Curia</a> [beast - state authority] that collaborate with his mission,” he defined. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In other words, the Pope speaks with the combined authority of head of the 
  church and head of state. So, according to Monsignor Parolin, just how common is this church-state 
  union in the world?</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“The Catholic Church is the only religious institution [church] that can <u>enter 
    into diplomatic relations</u> and that interests itself in international rights, 
    acting through the Holy See, an international sovereign subject [state] of singular 
    characteristics,&quot; Monsignor Parolin said.</p>
  <p>The Holy See thus requires a particular status, such as that given by the 
    definition of “subject <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Sui juris">‘sui juris,'&quot;</a> meaning the Holy See defines for itself 
    its juridical organization and does not receive it from outside, and <u>as 
    such, can enter into relationship with other states.</u></p>
  <p align="center">RELATIONS WITH THE KINGS OF THE EARTH</p>
  <p>Rev 17:1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, 
  and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will show unto thee the 
  judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:<br>
  Rev 17:2 <u>With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication</u>, 
  and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her 
  fornication.</p>
  <p>Rev 17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which <u>
  reigneth over the kings of the earth.</u></p>
  <p>Rev 18:3 <u>For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
  fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her</u>, 
  and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
  delicacies.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Unwittingly, Monsignor Parolin has clearly identified the Vatican as the <u>
  only</u> entity on earth that fits the prophecy of Revelation 17.</p>
