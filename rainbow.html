<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>On February 16, 1997, Pope John Paul II made the following comments during
  the homily while celebrating mass at the Roman parish of St. Andrew Avellino,
  which were published in the February 17th Vatican Information Service (VIS)
  press release:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Throughout history men have continued to commit sins, perhaps even
    greater ones than those described before the flood, ... Nonetheless, from
    the words of the covenant established by God with Noah, one can understand
    that no sin will ever again lead God to annihilate the world that He himself
    created.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John Paul II apparently needs to do some more Bible study on this matter. I
  am sure we all know the basic story of the flood, which God sent to destroy
  the wicked people on the earth. Indeed, what Christian child of any
  denomination does not know it? But what of God's promise to Noah? Let's look
  at what the Bible actually says on this matter-</p>
  <p><center><strong>The Rainbow - God's Covenant with mankind.</strong></center></p>
  <p>From the King James:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
    between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
    generations:<br>
    Gen 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
    covenant between me and the earth.<br>
    Gen 9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,
    that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:<br>
    Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and
    every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a
    flood to destroy all flesh.<br>
    Gen 9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I
    may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature
    of all flesh that is upon the earth.<br>
    Gen 9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I
    have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The covenant or promise that God made with Noah and the rest of humanity,
  as stated in verse 15, is that never again will He destroy the earth with a <em>flood
  of <strong>water</strong></em>. So the rainbow is a visible reminder that God
  promises water will never again cover the entire earth. The text does <strong><em>not</em></strong>
  state, however, that God will <strong><em>never</em></strong> again destroy
  the earth. Here is verse 15 in the Catholic Douay Rheims version of the Bible,
  just to show there is no translation problem-</p>
  <p>From the 1899 edition of the Douay Rheims-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 9:15 And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living
    soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to
    destroy all flesh.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Seems pretty clear even in the Catholic Bible that the promise from God is
  no more world-wide floods. But does the Bible tell us this world (and it's
  sinners) will never be destroyed again?</p>
  <p>From the King James-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Deu 32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
    lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire
    the foundations of the mountains.</p>
    <p>Psa 46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
    voice, the earth melted.<br>
    Psa 46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
    Selah.<br>
    Psa 46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made
    in the earth.
    <p>Zep 3:8 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I
    rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I
    may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my
    fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my
    jealousy.
    <p>2 Pet 3:7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word
    are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
    perdition of ungodly men.<br>
    2 Pet 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the
    which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall
    melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall
    be burned up.
    <p>Rev 20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
    camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God
    out of heaven, and devoured them.
    <p>Rev 20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
    second death.<br>
    Rev 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast
    into the lake of fire.<br>
    Rev 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
    the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
  </blockquote>
  <p>You see, God will not destroy this earth with a flood, but he will most
  assuredly destroy it with fire. The lake of fire is the ultimate destiny of
  all sinners, and once they have been destroyed, it consumes the entire earth
  in a cleansing fire, destroying all earthly evidence of sin. This time though,
  it is a flood of fire from heaven, and not water, that will consume the earth
  and wickedness. God then recreates the heavens and the earth, restoring the
  state of perfection that existed before Satan and the fall of Adam and Eve.</p>
  <p>So contrary to the statements of Pope John Paul II, the Bible teaches that
  this world will indeed be destroyed in the future, along with all sinners.
  This is just further proof that you should <em>read the Bible for yourself</em>
  to understand things like this, and not rely on Pope, priest, prelate or
  pastor to do your reading and interpretation for you. It is the <em>only</em>
  way to know what is true.
