   <table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFC4">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><font size="3">The ten commandments do not mention

    </tr>
  </table>      
  <p>That deliberately obscures the truth. It is a transparent attempt to deny 
  that God commands a specific day of the week to be the Sabbath. Here is the 
  commandment as set forth in Exodus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all 
    that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the 
    sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The &quot;seventh day&quot; mentioned in verse 10 refers to the seventh day of the 
  creation week:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and 
    he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now note this from the official Vatican Catechism:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>2174</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus rose from the dead &quot;on the first day of the 
    week.&quot;[104] Because it is the &quot;first day,&quot; the day of Christ's Resurrection 
    recalls the first creation. Because it is the &quot;eighth day&quot; following the 
    sabbath,[105] it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's 
    Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the first 
    of all feasts, the Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the 
      Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter from 
      darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior 
      rose from the dead.[106]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Sunday- fulfillment of the sabbath</h3>
    <p><b>2175</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday is expressly distinguished from the 
    sabbath which it follows chronologically every week; for Christians its 
    ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath.&nbsp; ...</p>

    Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) Online.</a></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the Vatican's own Catechism, a document with magisterial authority, readily admits what Fr. Echert tries to deny, that 
  Saturday is the day commanded by God to be the Sabbath day.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFC4">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><font size="3">The Church does have the authority to 
      shift that day, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
</font>

      ...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
  </div>
</font>

  <p>If God did <i>not</i> specify the seventh day of the week (Saturday) as the Sabbath, 
  as Fr. Echert tries to assert, then why does the Roman Catholic Church need 
  this presumed authority to &quot;shift&quot; the Sabbath to Sunday? That is just not 
  logical. Such presumed authority would only be asserted if God DID specify a day other 
  than that kept by the Roman Catholic Church. Only because Fr. Echert <i>knows</i> 
  that Saturday is the true Sabbath day commanded by God, does he attempt to 
  maintain the Church's authority to make a change to Sunday. </p>

  <p>A change in God's commandments is negated by Jesus Himself:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 5:17 <font color="#FF0000">Think not that I am come to destroy the 
    law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</font><br>
    Mat 5:18 <font color="#FF0000">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and 
    earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till 
    all be fulfilled.</font><br>
    Mat 5:19 <font color="#FF0000">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these 
    least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in 
    the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall 
    be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></p>
    <p>John 14:15 <font color="#FF0000">If ye love me, keep my commandments.</font></p>
    <p>John 15:10<font color="#FF0000"> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall 
    abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in 
    his love.</font></p>

  <font size="3">
  <div align="center">

  <table border="1" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFC4">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><font size="3">... and based upon the fact that our Lord

  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that 
    in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the above verse God blessed and sanctified the seventh day of the week, 
  which as already has been shown, the Vatican Catechism acknowledges to be 
  Saturday. But where in the Bible does the Lord bless or consecrate the first 
  day of the week, Sunday, to be kept every week? It is not to be found. <i>It 
  is not a &quot;fact&quot; that can be established in the Bible with a &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot;, </i>and 
  Fr. Echert <i>knows</i> and <i>admits</i> this (see below).</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFC4">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><font size="3">The Acts of the Apostles records the honor 
      of Sunday, referred to as &quot;the Day of the Lord.&quot;
</font>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>In the book of Acts, there are but two verses to consider:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with 
    one accord in one place.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Does that verse say that &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot; or &quot;the Lord's day&quot; was being honored or observed? No it does 
  not. Does that verse say the disciples were meeting to honor the resurrection 
  or to keep holy the first day of the week? No it does not. They were together 
  because it was the festival of Pentecost, not because it was Sunday (although 
  that year, by coincidence, Pentecost was on a Sunday).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came 
    together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the 
    morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Does that verse say the disciples were meeting to honor or keep holy the 
  day of the resurrection? No it does not. Does that verse say that the first 
  day of the week was now being honored as &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot; or &quot;The Lord's day&quot;? No it does not.</p>
  <p>The book of Acts does not tell us that Sunday is to be honored or observed 
  as a weekly holy day, nor does the Bible anywhere designate Sunday, the first 
  day of the week, to be &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot; or &quot;the Lord's 
  day.&quot; Fr. Echert's assertion is simply untrue.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFC4">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><font size="3">We continue this practice, as handed down 
      by the Apostles, and perhaps as explicitly commanded them by the Lord 
      Himself--we cannot assume that everything our Lord instructed them over 
      the course of forty days is recorded in the few verses of the Gospels 
      which regard the Risen Christ period.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Note that Fr. Echert concedes here, that in the Bible, Jesus never 
  commanded a change to Sunday keeping. Neither can he prove from the Bible that the Apostles 
  kept Sunday to honor the resurrection, or commanded it. He admits he has 
  nothing but the assumptions of Catholic Tradition on which to base his Sunday 
  keeping, since Sunday sacredness is simply not taught in scripture.<br>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="12" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#FFFFC4">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><font size="3">And the confused and mistaken beliefs and 
      practices of heretics and non-Catholics should not call into question what 
      the true Church does.</font></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>I think it has just been amply demonstrated who has the confused and 
  mistaken beliefs and practices. </p>
  <p>Scripture has this to say about the people of God, the true church:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 2:3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his 
    commandments.<br>
    1 John 2:4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a 
    liar, and the truth is not in him.</p>
    <p>1 John 3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he 
    in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he 
    hath given us.</p>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war 
    with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have 
    the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Rev 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
    commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Since the Roman Catholic Church breaks and profanes the Lord's Sabbath day, and teaches 
  others to do so, and also prides herself in having the presumed authority to 
  abolish/modify one of the Ten Commandments, <i>it cannot possibly be the true 
  church.</i> Rather it is the little horn power described by the prophet Daniel:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:25 And he [the little horn] shall speak great words against the 
    most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to 
    change times and laws [of the most High]: and they shall be given into his 
    hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
