<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and 
    said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.<br>
    Gen 4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, 
    but Cain was a tiller of the ground.<br>
    Gen 4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the 
    fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.<br>
    Gen 4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the 
    fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:<br>
    Gen 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was 
    very wroth, and his countenance fell.<br>
    Gen 4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy 
    countenance fallen?<br>
    Gen 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest 
    not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou 
    shalt rule over him.<br>
    Gen 4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when 
    they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew 
    him.<br>
    Gen 4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, 
    I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?<br>
    Gen 4:10 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood 
    crieth unto me from the ground.<br>
    Gen 4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth 
    to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;<br>
    Gen 4:12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto 
    thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.<br>
    Gen 4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can 
    bear. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Cain and Abel both brought offerings before the Lord. Abel being a shepherd 
  brought in addition to his other offerings, a first-born lamb to sacrifice to 
  the Lord. Cain, being a farmer, brought only crops to offer to the Lord, but 
  no lamb. The Lord accepted the offerings and sacrifice of Abel, but rejected 
  the offerings of Cain. Why? Why would the Lord reject the best that Cain had 
  produced? The answer is actually quite simple.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>NIV Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. 
    By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his 
    offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</p>
    <p>NIV 1 John 3:12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and 
    murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions 
    were evil and his brother's were righteous.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Both Cain and Abel had been asked by the Lord to offer a sacrifice for a 
  specific reason. Sacrifices to the Lord were symbolic of the price that Jesus 
  would ultimately pay. The blood of the Lamb of God, the Christ, the Messiah, 
  would be shed to atone for the sins of all humanity. Cain's offering lacked 
  this symbolic animal blood sacrifice and as a result amounted to his works 
  alone. So Cain represented salvation by works, while Abel's offering 
  represented atonement with God through the shedding of blood of a first-born 
  lamb, which represented Jesus Christ: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
    <strong>without shedding of blood is no remission.</strong></p>
    <p>Heb 12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood 
    of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Abel's offering of a first-born lamb was merely symbolic, while the 
  offering of Jesus as the Lamb of God at the cross was the fulfillment of that 
  symbolism. Cain's refusal to offer a lamb was actually a rejection of his need 
  for a Redeemer. And make no mistake, Cain knew exactly what he was doing. He 
  was not acting in ignorance. He was deliberately disobeying God by not 
  offering a lamb- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest 
    not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou 
    shalt rule over him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Lord makes clear to Cain that if he does well (follows God's 
  instructions) then his offering to God will be accepted just like Abel's, but 
  if he disobeys then he will have sinned against God. What is sin? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin 
    is the transgression of the law.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So Cain sinned against God by transgressing his instructions (law) to 
  provide a lamb for a blood sacrifice, a sacrifice symbolic of the crucifixion 
  of Jesus Christ. It should be clear that this is the reason that what some 
  might call the unbloody &quot;sacrifice&quot; of Cain was <em>not</em> acceptable to 
  God. </p>
  <p>The Hebrew word for sacrifice is defined in Strong's as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>H2077. zebach, zeh'-bakh; from H2076; prop. a slaughter, i.e. the flesh 
    of an animal; by impl. a sacrifice (the victim or the act):--offer (-ing), 
    sacrifice.</p>
    <p>H2076. zabach, zaw-bakh'; a prim. root; to slaughter an animal (usually 
    in sacrifice):--kill, offer, (do) sacrifice, slay. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that a sacrifice specifically involves the slaughtering of an animal 
  as an offering. Since Cain's offering lacked a slaughtered first-born lamb and 
  was a completely bloodless offering, in that sense it was not a sacrifice at 
  all, and so was rejected by God, since only blood (death) can atone for the 
  sinner (Heb 9:22).</p>
  <p>With the advent of the Tabernacle or Sanctuary at Sinai, God again gave 
  instructions to his people to offer up blood sacrifices (such as lambs), on a 
  regular basis. The Hebrew Sanctuary was an instructional tool of God's to 
  illustrate the plan of salvation to His people, all of it pointing to Jesus 
  Christ as the coming Lamb of God. These animal sacrifices which were brought 
  by the people to the Temple, were a personal loss to the repentant sinner, 
  illustrating death as the consequences of sin, and went on to be burnt 
  offerings on the Brazen Altar. </p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">The Lord's Supper / Passover Meal</font></b></u></p>
  <p>The Passover meal of unleavened bread and wine on 14 Nisan, the evening 
  before our Lord's sacrifice on the cross, was <i>not</i> part of a formal 
  religious worship service. It was certainly not the elaborate, rather 
  prolonged liturgical service found in the Roman Catholic Church. It was a 
  simple yet solemn meal that the Jews had been having <i>in their homes</i> on 
  Passover for hundreds of years, though to be sure, the symbolism of the 
  unleavened Passover meal was indeed important, as it represented the sinless 
  Messiah, the Lamb of God who would be crucified on 14 Nisan and shed His blood 
  for the sins of the world. </p>
  <p>During the Lord's supper, the evening before He was crucified, Jesus 
  revealed to His disciples that He was the fulfillment of the Passover meal 
  symbolism when He said &quot;This is my body&quot; and &quot;This is my blood&quot; (Matt 
  26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20, 1 Cor. 11:24-25), though it is 
  unlikely His disciples understood this until after the resurrection. </p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5"><u><b>This do in <i>remembrance</i> of me</b></u></font></p>
  <p>And what purpose does the Lord's supper serve? Scripture tells us 
  precisely:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
    <font color="#FF0000">Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: 
    this do in remembrance of me.</font><br>
    1 Cor 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
    saying, <font color="#FF0000">This cup is the new testament in my blood: 
    this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</font><br>
    1 Cor 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do 
    show the Lord's death till he come.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus and Paul tell us clearly, the Lord's supper is a symbolic reminder, a 
  memorial of the death of Christ.</p>
  <center>
  <p><strong><u><font size="5">Jesus Christ's Shed Blood Cleanses Us From All 
  Sin</font></u></strong></p>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for 
    many for the remission of sins.</p>
    <p>1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have 
    fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth 
    us from all sin.</p>
    <p>Eph 1:7 In whom (by Christ) we have redemption through his blood, the 
    forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</p>
    <p>Col 1:14 ... we have redemption through his (Christ's) blood, even the 
    forgiveness of sins:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><u><strong><font size="5">Christ Was Offered Once As A 
    Sacrifice For Sin</font></strong></u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At the actual moment of His death on the cross, scripture tells us the veil 
  in the Temple between the Holy and Most Holy place tore from top to bottom-
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up 
    the ghost.<br>
    Mat 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top 
    to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>With the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, there would be no more need for 
  actual blood sacrifices of lambs. The supreme sacrifice had been made, the 
  price for the sins of humanity had been paid in full. Now an earthly 
  priesthood would not be necessary to approach God for forgiveness. Jesus with 
  His resurrection became our High Priest-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 3:1 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, 
    consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>
    <p>Heb 4:14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed 
    into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.<br>
    Heb 4:15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the 
    feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, 
    yet without sin.<br>
    Heb 4:16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may 
    obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
    <p>Heb 6:20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an 
    high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>With Jesus as our High Priest, we now have direct access to the Most Holy 
  place of the heavenly temple, the place of judgment. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 7:22 By so much was <strong>Jesus</strong> made a surety of a better 
    testament.<br>
    Heb 7:23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to 
    continue by reason of death:<br>
    Heb 7:24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable 
    priesthood.<br>
    Heb 7:25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come 
    unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.<br>
    Heb 7:26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, 
    undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;<br>
    Heb 7:27 <strong>Who <em>needeth not daily</em>, as those high priests, to 
    offer up sacrifice</strong>, first for his own sins, and then for the 
    people's: for <strong>this he did once</strong>, when he offered up himself.</p>
    <p>John 19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said,
    <strong>It is finished:</strong> and he bowed his head, and gave up the 
    ghost. </p>
    <p>Heb 9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, 
    which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in 
    the presence of God for us:<br>
    Heb 9:25 <b>Nor yet that he should offer himself often</b>, as the high 
    priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;<br>
    Heb 9:26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the 
    world: <b>but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away 
    sin by the sacrifice of himself.</b><br>
    Heb 9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the 
    judgment:<br>
    Heb 9:28 <strong>So <strong>Christ was once offered</strong> to bear the 
    sins of many</strong>; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the 
    second time without sin unto salvation.</p>
    <p><font size="3">Heb 10:1 For the law having a shadow of good things to 
    come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices 
    which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto 
    perfect.</font> </p>
    <p>Heb 10:8 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings 
    and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; 
    which are offered by the law;<br>
    Heb 10:9 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the 
    first, that he may establish the second.<br>
    Heb 10:10 By the which will <strong>we are sanctified through the offering 
    of the body of Jesus Christ once for all</strong>.<br>
    Heb 10:11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering 
    oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:<br>
    Heb 10:12 But this man, <b>after </b><strong>he had offered one sacrifice 
    for sins for ever</strong>, sat down on the right hand of God;<br>
    Heb 10:13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.<br>
    Heb 10:14 For by <strong>one offering he hath perfected for ever them that 
    are sanctified</strong>. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which was finished at the cross (John 
  19:30), did away with the continual daily offering of sacrifices by earthly 
  priests <nobr>(Heb 7:27, 10:8-9). </nobr>The daily sacrifices offered by 
  earthly priests did nothing to take away sins <nobr>(Heb 10:11).</nobr> But 
  Jesus Christ made one sacrifice for sin, paid the price to take away the sins 
  of the world through the shedding of His blood on the cross<nobr>.</nobr> 
  After that perfect sacrifice was finished, it was offered once to the Father 
  and accepted, and then Jesus sat down on the right hand of the Father (Heb 
  10:12). The offering of Christ's sacrifice to the Father was made only once 
  (Heb 10:10) and is sufficient for the salvation of all who have faith (Heb. 
  9:26,28, 10:14).</p>
  <p>Please note Hebrews 7:27 again. It says that Jesus' sacrifice need not be 
  offered up to the Father on a daily basis, yet this is <em>exactly</em> what 
  the Roman Catholic Church teaches in respect to the Mass, in direct 
  contradiction to scripture.</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">There Is But One Mediator of the New 
  Covenant</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 2:5&nbsp; For there is one God, and one mediator between God and 
    men, the man Christ Jesus;<br>
    <br>
    Heb 9:15&nbsp; And for this cause he [Christ] is the mediator of the new 
    testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions 
    that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the 
    promise of eternal inheritance.<br>
    <br>
    Heb 12:24&nbsp; And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the 
    blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">What does it mean that Jesus Christ is the one mediator of the 
  New Covenant?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he [Christ] is faithful and just to 
    forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
    <p>1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin 
    not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ 
    the righteous:</p>
    <p>Rom 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the 
    power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, 
    and also to the Greek.<br>
    Rom 1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to 
    faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>

  <p><strong><u><font size="5">The Unbloody Sacrifice of the Mass</font></u></strong></p>
  </center>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass is the Church's greatest prayer. In it, 
    Jesus Christ becomes present and offers Himself in love to the Father as He 
    did on the Cross almost 2,000 years ago.</p>
    <p>Although the Sacrifice of the Mass and Jesus' Sacrifice on Calvary are 
    the SAME, there are important DIFFERENCES in these two actions of Christ. On 
    the Cross, Our Lord offered Himself in a BLOODY MANNER; whereas, in the Holy 
    Mass, He offers Himself in an UNBLOODY MANNER. This in no way implies that 
    Jesus' Blood is no longer present in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. It 
    simply means that Jesus chooses to act in a different way at Mass than He 
    did on the Cross. </p>

    spiritual sacrifices of the participants are finally consecrated, so as to 
    become truly, really and substantially Christ's own body that is given up

  <p>The book of&nbsp; Hebrews, chapters 7, 9 and 10, cited above, make it quite 
  clear that Christ only offered Himself as a sacrifice once, and that sacrifice 
  was finished at the cross. He need not offer Himself in sacrifice on a daily 
  basis, yet in absolute contradiction to scripture, this is exactly what <i>
  Catholic Truth for Youth</i> and John Paul II, cited above, are claiming 
  happens at the Catholic Mass.</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="1">
  <p>From the new Vatican's <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1365</strong>
    <spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">Because it is a memorial of Christ's 
    Passover, the Eucharist is also a sacrifice. The Sacrificial character of 
    the Eucharist is manifested in the very words of institution: &quot;This is my 
    body which is given for you&quot; and &quot;This cup which is poured out for you is 
    the New Covenant in my blood.&quot; [185] In the Eucharist Christ gives us the 
    very body which he gave up for us on the cross, the very blood which he 
    &quot;poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.&quot; [186]</p>
    <p><strong>1366</strong>
    <spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice 
    because it <em>re-presents</em> (makes present) the sacrifice of the cross, 
    because it is its <em>memorial</em> and because it <em>applies</em> the 
    fruit: </p>
    <p>[Christ], our Lord and God, was once and for all to offer himself to God 
    the Father by his death on the altar of the cross, to accomplish there an 
    everlasting redemption. But because his priesthood was not to end with his 
    death, at the Last Supper &quot;on the night when he was betrayed,&quot; [he wanted] 
    to leave his beloved spouse the Church a visible sacrifice (as the nature of 
    man demands) by which the bloody sacrifice which he was to accomplish one 
    for all on the cross would be re-presented, its memory perpetuated until the 
    end of the world, and its salutary power be applied to the forgiveness of 
    the sins we daily commit. [187] </p>
    <p><strong>1367</strong>
    <spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">The sacrifice of Christ and the 
    sacrifice of the Eucharist are <em>one single sacrifice.</em> &quot;The victim is 
    one and the same: the same now offers through the ministry of priests, who 
    then offered himself on the cross; only the manner of offering is 
    different.&quot; &quot;In this divine sacrifice which is celebrated in the Mass, the 
    same Christ who offered himself once in a bloody manner on the altar of the 
    cross is contained and is offered in an unbloody manner.&quot; [188] </p>

  <p>Please notice above that in paragraph 1365 of the Vatican Catechism it is 
  declared that the Eucharist is a <em>sacrifice</em>, and in paragraph 1367 the 
  Eucharist is described as an <em>unbloody sacrifice</em>? Did we not establish 
  in the fourth chapter of Genesis that &quot;unbloody sacrifices&quot; like that of Cain 
  are <em>unacceptable</em> to God? And 1366-1367 claim the Mass re-presents 
  Christ as a sacrifice, which the book of Hebrews, cited above, specifically

    Spirit, Amen. Certain people, in some parts of the world, have rashly dared 
    to assert that the christian people ought to receive the holy sacrament of 
    the eucharist under the forms of both bread and wine. They communicate the 
    laity everywhere not only under the form of bread but also under that of 
    wine, and they stubbornly assert that they should communicate even after a 
    meal, or else without the need of a fast, contrary to the church's custom 
    which has been laudably and sensibly approved, from the church's head 
    downwards, but which they damnably try to repudiate as sacrilegious. 
    Therefore this present general council of Constance, legitimately assembled 
    in the holy Spirit, wishing to provide for the safety of the faithful 
    against this error, after long deliberation by many persons learned in 
    divine and human law, declares, decrees and defines that, although Christ 
    instituted this venerable sacrament after a meal and ministered it to his 
    apostles under the forms of both bread and wine, nevertheless and 
    notwithstanding this, the praiseworthy authority of the sacred canons and 
    the approved custom of the church have and do retain that this sacrament 
    ought not to be celebrated after a meal nor received by the faithful without 
    fasting, except in cases of sickness or some other necessity as permitted by 
    law or by the church. Moreover, just as this custom was sensibly introduced 
    in order to avoid various dangers and scandals, so with similar or even 
    greater reason was it possible to introduce and sensibly observe the custom 
    that, although this sacrament was received by the faithful under both kinds 
    in the early church, nevertheless later it was received under both kinds 
    only by those confecting it, and by the laity only under the form of bread. 
    For it should be very firmly believed, and in no way doubted, that the whole 
    body and blood of Christ are truly contained under both the form of bread 
    and the form of wine. Therefore, since this custom was introduced for good 
    reasons by the church and holy fathers, and has been observed for a very 
    long time, it should be held as a law which nobody may repudiate or alter at 
    will without the church's permission. To say that the observance of this 
    custom or law is sacrilegious or illicit must be regarded as erroneous. 
    Those who stubbornly assert the opposite of the aforesaid are to be confined 
    as heretics and severely punished by the local bishops or their officials or 
    the inquisitors of heresy in the kingdoms or provinces in which anything is 
    attempted or presumed against this decree, according to the canonical and 
    legitimate sanctions that have been wisely established in favour of the 
    catholic faith against heretics and their supporters.</p>
    <p>This holy synod also decrees and declares, regarding this matter, that 
    instructions are to be sent to the most reverend fathers and lords in 
    Christ, patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops, and their vicars in 
    spirituals, wherever they may be, in which they are to be commissioned and 
    ordered on the authority of this sacred council and under pain of 
    excommunication, to punish effectively those who err against this decree. 
    They may receive back into the church's fold those who have gone astray by 
    communicating the people under the forms of both bread and wine, and have 
    taught this, provided they repent and after a salutary penance, in 
    accordance with the measure of their fault, has been enjoined upon them. 
    They are to repress as heretics, however, by means of the church's censures 
    and even if necessary by calling in the help of the secular arm, those of 
    them whose hearts have become hardened and who are unwilling to return to 
    penance. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This was also affirmed at the Council of Trent, the 21st session, July 
  16th, 1562:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <center>
    <p><em>Canons on Communion Under Both Kinds</em></p>
    </center>
    <p></p>
    <p>1. If anyone says that each and every one of Christ's faithful ought to 
    receive both species of the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, because of 
    a command from God or because it is necessary for salvation: let him be 
    anathema. </p>
    <p>2. If anyone says that the holy Catholic Church was not led by good 
    reasons to have the laity and the clerics who are not celebrating Mass 
    communicate under the species of bread alone, or that the Church erred in 
    doing so: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>3. If anyone denies that the whole and entire Christ, the source and 
    author of all graces, is received under the species of bread alone, 
    alleging, as some falsely do, that such reception is not in accord with 
    Christ's institution of the Sacrament under both species: let him be 
    anathema. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This practice of the laity receiving only the bread continues to a large 
  extent even today, although Vatican II in 1965 (Article 55 of the Liturgical 
  Constitution) permitted communion in both kinds. The body and blood are both 
  fully represented in the bread only, or so Catholics are told to excuse their 
  not receiving the wine. The truth is they have been denied the symbol of 
  Christ's blood in an &quot;unbloody Mass&quot; and then given doubletalk that the blood 
  is really contained in the bread.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 6:54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal 
    life; and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
    John 6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.<br>
    John 6:56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, 
    and I in him.</p>
    <p>Mat 26:26 (NIV) While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and 
    broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, &quot;Take and eat; this is my 
    body.&quot;<br>
    Mat 26:27 Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, 
    &quot;<strong>Drink from it, all of you.</strong><br>
    Mat 26:28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for 
    the forgiveness of sins. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Catholics interpret the above verses quite literally, yet they will 
  regularly deny anyone but the priest from drinking the wine. When Christ 
  celebrated the Passover meal everyone received both bread and wine, but the 
  Catholic Church makes excuses about not wanting to spill any wine, or that a 
  common cup is not sanitary, to withhold it from their congregation.</p>
  <p>Also, did you notice in the quote from the Council of Trent, in paragraph 
  1366, that man's nature demands the sacrifice of Jesus be re-presented 
  (presented again)? What did scripture tell us?- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 10:14 <strong>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them 
    that are sanctified.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The nature of man showed itself with Cain, who insisted his &quot;unbloody 
  sacrifice&quot; was sufficient. Who are we in our fallen sinful nature to demand 
  anything of God? The sacrifice of Jesus was made but <strong>once</strong>, 
  and is <strong><em>not</em></strong> presented time and again in what is 
  called the Mass.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="5"><u>I will drink no more of the fruit of 
  the vine</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for 
    many for the remission of sins.<br>
    Mat 26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of 
    the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's 
    kingdom.</p>
    <p>Mark 14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, 
    which is shed for many.<br>
    Mark 14:25 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the 
    vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</p>
    <p>Luke 22:15 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this 
    passover with you before I suffer:<br>
    Luke 22:16 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be 
    fulfilled in the kingdom of God.<br>
    Luke 22:17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and 
    divide it among yourselves:<br>
    Luke 22:18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, 
    until the kingdom of God shall come.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">What did Jesus drink at the Last Supper? The fruit of the 
  vine: grape juice. And He says He will <i>only</i> drink it again with the 
  Saints in Heaven. Catholics contradict this, and say it is <i>not</i> the 
  fruit of the vine they drink at Mass, since they teach it has been 
  transubstantiated by the priest into the blood of Christ.</p>
  <p></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><strong><u><font size="5">The Catholic Eucharist and 
    Forgiveness.</font></u></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What does reception of the Eucharist during Mass do according to Catholic 
  Church? Again, the following is from the Vatican's <i>Catechism of the 
  Catholic Church</i>: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1394</strong><spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15"> As bodily 
    nourishment restores lost strength, so the Eucharist strengthens our 
    charity, which tends to be weakened in daily life; and this living charity
    <em><font color="#FF0000">wipes away venial sins.</font></em> ...</p>
    <p><strong>1395</strong>
    <spacer TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="15">By the same charity that it enkindles in 
    us, the Eucharist <em>preserves us from future mortal sins.</em> The more we 
    share the life of Christ and progress in his friendship, the more difficult 
    it is to break away from him by mortal sin. <font color="#FF0000">The 
    Eucharist is not ordered to the forgiveness of mortal sins</font> - that is 
    proper to the sacrament of Reconciliation. The Eucharist is properly the 
    sacrament of those who are in full communion with the church. </p>
    <p><b>1416</b> <font color="#FF0000">Communion with the Body and Blood of 
    Christ increases the communicant's union with the Lord, forgives his venial 
    sins,</font> and preserves him from grave sins. Since receiving this 
    sacrament strengthens the bonds of charity between the communicant and 
    Christ, it also reinforces the unity of the Church as the Mystical Body of 
    Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that even though the Catholic Church teaches that the Eucharist 
  re-presents the same sacrifice of Jesus (CCC #1365-1367), it is &quot;<i>not</i> 
  ordered for the forgiveness of mortal sins!&quot; So just what is the alleged 
  difference in venial and mortal sins?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Every violation of the Commandments of God or of the Church is a sin: <em>
    mortal sin</em>, if three conditions are present - serious matter, 
    sufficient reflection, and full consent of the will; <em>venial sin</em>, if 
    the law violated concerns matter that is not grave or the offense is 
    committed without sufficient reflection or full consent of the will. Venial 
    sin does not deprive the soul of sanctifying grace.</p>
    <p>Mortal sin deprives us of sanctifying grace and brings eternal punishment 
    to the soul, if we pass from this life before confessing this sin and 
    obtaining forgiveness. ... </p>
    <p>Source: <i>Dictionary of the Liturgy</i>, by Rev. Jovian P. Lang, OFM, 
    Catholic Book Publishing Co., New York, Copyright 1989, ISBN 0-89942-273-X, 
    page 588.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the Mass of the Catholic Church, the re-presentation or continuation of 
  Christ's sacrifice in the Eucharist, will only wash away trivial daily sins. 
  The true Body and Blood of Christ, they say (contrary to scripture), is <i>
  insufficient</i> for redemption. For serious intentional soul damning sin you 
  must go to the Catholic priest and obtain forgiveness from him! Note that even 
  the Old Testament priests never could take away sin. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 10:11 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering 
    oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:<br>
    Heb 10:12 But this man (Jesus Christ), <b><u><font size="4">after</font></u>
    </b><strong>he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever</strong>, sat 
    down on the right hand of God;<br>
    Heb 10:13 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.<br>
    Heb 10:14 For by <strong><u><font size="4">one offering</font></u> he hath 
    perfected for ever them that are sanctified</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note again that the <u>one sacrificial offering</u> was completed <i>before</i> 
  Christ sat down on the right hand of God. The sacrifice is over, done, 
  finished at the cross, having been offered but once.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he [Jesus Christ] is faithful and just 
    to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The sacrificial death of Jesus was sufficient for all the sins of mankind, 
  and that offering of his blood was made <i>only once</i>. It is not something 
  that is dispensed or re-presented by earthly priests, it was offered <i>once</i> 
  by Jesus Christ Himself directly, and He is faithful and just to forgive us 
  our sins, without need of earthly priests. As scripture shows, the Roman 
  Catholic Priest who claims to repeatedly offer an unbloody sacrifice for the 
  forgiveness of sins during Mass, stands with Cain in defiance of God, and as 
  such can never receive God's approval, and does nothing that really forgives 
  any sins at all. Go directly to your High Priest Jesus Christ in prayer, to 
  the Lamb of God Himself to repent of your sins, and you will indeed be 
  forgiven completely of all your sins! </p>
