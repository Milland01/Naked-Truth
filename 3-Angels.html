    <p>Rev 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the 
    everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every 
    nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
    Rev 14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the 
    hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, 
    and the sea, and the fountains of waters.<br>
    Rev 14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is 
    fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of 
    the wrath of her fornication.<br>
    Rev 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any 
    man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, 
    or in his hand,<br>
    Rev 14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is 
    poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be 
    tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in 
    the presence of the Lamb:<br>
    Rev 14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and 
    they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and 
    whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<br>
    Rev 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the 
    commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 24:14 <font color="#FF0000">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be 
    preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the 
    end come.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The messages proclaimed by these 3 angels just prior to the second coming, are the most serious, clear, and 
  urgent warnings to be found in all of scripture, and they need to be 
  understood by all Christians. They include clear instructions as to what needs 
  to be done to heed the warning, so as to escape the full wrath of God that is 
  sure to fall on those who worship &quot;the beast&quot;, or his &quot;image&quot;, by receiving 
  the &quot;mark of the beast&quot;. Knowing who and what these are is obviously of the 
  utmost importance, and the key to understanding them is found in what that 
  warning says should be done, to assure immunity from the terrible punishment 
  to come. Two verses provide this crucial information that assure safety, 
  verses 7 and 12.</p>
  <p>Verse 12 provides in the clearest terms that the faithful saints of God 
  &quot;keep the commandments of God&quot;. Because of their obedience, they are not 
  subject to the punishment that God will pour out in full measure. Clearly if commandment 
  keeping provides safety and immunity, <i>breaking</i> God's commandments is 
  what constitutes worshipping &quot;the beast&quot;, or his &quot;image&quot;, and receiving the 
  &quot;mark of the beast&quot;.</p>
  <p>Verse 7 gives us more specific and clear information to identify, in no 
  uncertain terms, the primary commandment of God that is involved in the 
  warning: &quot;<u>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea</u>, and the 
  fountains of waters.&quot; We need only to examine the 10 commandments of God and 
  see what commandment this is quoting.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou 
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, 
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy 
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days <u>the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and 
    all that in them is,</u> and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD 
    blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Could anything be more clear? The fourth commandment regarding keeping the 
  seventh day Sabbath is the primary characteristic that distinguishes the 
  saints of God, and <i>prevents</i> them from worshipping &quot;the beast&quot;, or his 
  &quot;image&quot;, and from receiving the &quot;mark of the beast&quot;. The seventh day Sabbath 
  is Saturday. So the 3 angel's are warning that the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; and his 
  &quot;image&quot; involves <i>breaking</i> God's Saturday Sabbath commandment.</p>
  <p>Scripture also clearly prophesied that an apostate Christian church would 
  boldly try to change the commandments of God, and persecute the true saints of 
  God. For the details see <b><a href="lawlessness.html">Lawlessness In The 
  Temple Of God.</a></b></p>
