  <p>Most Christians assume that Sunday is the biblically approved day
of worship. The Roman Catholic Church protests that it transferred
Christian worship from the biblical Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday, and
that to try to argue that the change was made in the Bible is both
dishonest and a denial of Catholic authority. If Protestantism wants to
base its teachings only on the Bible, it should worship on Saturday.</p>
  <p>Over one hundred years ago the <i>Catholic Mirror</i><strong><em>
  </em> </strong>ran a series of articles discussing the right of the
Protestant churches to worship on Sunday. The articles stressed that
unless one was willing to accept the authority of the Catholic Church
to designate the day of worship, the Christian should observe Saturday.
Those articles are presented here in their entirety.</p>

General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists adopted certain
resolutions appealing to the government and people of the United States
from the decision of the Supreme Court declaring this to be a Christian
nation, and from the action of Congress in legislating upon the subject
of religion*, and remonstrating against the principle and all the
consequences of the same. In March 1893, the <b> <a
 href="http://www.irla.org/">International Religious Liberty Association</a></b>
printed these resolutions in a tract entitled <em><b><a
 href="Appeal%20and%20Remonstrance.pdf">Appeal and Remonstrance</a></b>.</em>
On receipt of one of these, the editor of the <em>Catholic Mirror </em>of
Baltimore, Maryland, published a series of four editorials, which
appeared in that paper September, 2, 9, 16, and 23, 1893. The <em>Catholic
Mirror </em>was the official organ of Cardinal Gibbons and the Papacy
in the United States.</td>

      </blockquote>
      <hr align="center" size="1" width="25%">
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left">&nbsp; Our attention has been called to the
above subject in the past week by the receipt of a brochure of
twenty-one pages, published by the International Religious Liberty
Association, entitled, "Appeal and Remonstrance," embodying resolutions
adopted the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists (February
24th, '93). The resolutions criticize and censure, with much acerbity,
the action of the United States Congress, and of the Supreme Court, for
the invading the rights of the people by closing the World's Fair on
Sunday.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adventists are the only body of Christians with the
Bible as their teacher, who can find no warrant in its pages for the
change of the day from the seventh to the first. Hence their
appellation, "Seventh-day Adventists." Their cardinal principle
consists in setting apart Saturday for the exclusive worship of God, in
conformity with the positive command of God himself, repeatedly
reiterated in the sacred books of the Old and New Testaments, literally
obeyed by the children of Israel for thousands of years to this day,
and endorsed by the teaching and practice of the Son of God whilst on
earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Per contra, the Protestants of the world, the Adventists
excepted, with the <em>same</em> Bible as their cherished and sole
infallible teacher, by their practice, since their appearance in the
sixteenth century, with the time-honored practice of the Jewish people
before their eyes, have rejected the day named for His worship by God,
and assumed, in apparent contradiction of His command, a day for His
worship never once referred to for that purpose, in the pages of that
Sacred Volume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; What Protestant pulpit does not ring almost every Sunday
with loud and impassioned invectives against Sabbath violation? Who can
forget the fanatical clamor of the Protestant ministers throughout the
length and breadth of the land against opening the gates of the World's
Fair on Sunday? the thousands of petitions, signed by millions, to save
the Lord's Day from desecration? Surely, such general and widespread
excitement and noisy remonstrance could not have existed without the
strongest grounds for such animated protests.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when quarters were assigned at the World's Fair to the
various sects of Protestantism for the exhibition of articles, who can
forget the emphatic expressions of virtuous and conscientious
indignation exhibited by our Presbyterian brethren, as soon as they
learned of the decision of the Supreme Court not to interfere in the
Sunday opening? The newspapers informed us that they flatly refused to
utilize the space accorded them, or open their boxes, demanding the
right to withdraw the articles, in rigid adherence to their principles,
and thus decline all contact with the sacrilegious and Sabbath-breaking
Exhibition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Doubtless, our Calvinistic brethren deserved and shared
the sympathy of all the other sects, who, however, lost the opportunity
of posing as martyrs in vindication of the Sabbath observance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They thus became a "spectacle to the world, to angels, and
to men," although their Protestant brethren, who failed to share the
monopoly, were uncharitably and enviously disposed to attribute their
steadfast adherence to religious principle, to Pharisaical pride and
dogged obstinacy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our purpose in throwing off this article, is to shed such
light on this all-important question (for were the Sabbath question to
be removed from the Protestant pulpit, the sects would feel lost, and
the preachers be deprived of their "Cheshire cheese") that our readers
may be able to comprehend the question in <em>all its bearings</em>,
and thus reach a clear conviction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christian world is, morally speaking, united on the
question and practice of worshiping God on <em>the first day</em> of
the week.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Israelites, scattered all over the earth, keep <em>the
last day</em> of the week sacred to the worship of the Deity. In this
particular, the Seventh-day Adventists (a sect of Christians
numerically few) have also selected the same day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Israelites and Adventists both appeal to the Bible for the
divine command, persistently obliging the strict observance of Saturday.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Israelite respects the authority of the Old Testament
only, but the Adventist, who is a Christian, accepts the New Testament
on the same ground as the Old: viz., an inspired record also. He finds
that the Bible, his teacher, is consistent in both parts, that the
Redeemer, during His mortal life, never kept any other day than
Saturday. The Gospels plainly evince to him this fact; whilst, in the
pages of the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse,
not the vestige of an act canceling the Saturday arrangement can be
found.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adventists, therefore, in common with Israelites,
derive their belief from the Old Testament, which position is confirmed
by the New Testament, endorsing fully by the life and practice of the
Redeemer and His apostles the teaching of the Sacred Word for nearly a
century of the Christian era.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerically considered, the Seventh-day Adventists form an
insignificant portion of the Protestants population of the earth, but,
as the question is not one of numbers, but of truth, and right, a
strict sense of justice forbids the condemnation of this little sect
without a calm and unbiased investigation; this is none of our funeral.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Protestant world has been, from its infancy, in the
sixteenth century, in thorough accord with the Catholic Church, in
keeping "holy," not Saturday, but Sunday. The discussion of the grounds
that led to this unanimity of sentiment and practice of over 300 years,
must help toward placing Protestantism on a solid basis in this
particular, should the arguments in favor of its position overcome
those furnished by the Israelites and Adventists, the Bible, the sole
recognized teacher of both litigants, being the umpire and witness. If
however, on the other hand, the latter furnish arguments,
incontrovertible by the great mass of Protestants, both cases of
litigants, appealing to their common teacher, the Bible, the great body
of Protestants, so far from clamoring, as they do with vigorous
pertinacity for the strict keeping of Sunday, have no other resource
[recourse] left than the admission that they have been teaching and
practicing <em>what is Scripturally false for over three centuries,</em>
by adopting the teaching and practice of what they have always
pretended to believe an apostate church, contrary to every warrant and
teaching of sacred Scripture. To add to the intensity of this
Scriptural and unpardonable blunder, it involves one of the most
positive and emphatic commands of God to His servant, man: "Remember
the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; No Protestant living today has ever yet obeyed that
command, preferring to follow the apostate church referred to than his
teacher the Bible, which, from Genesis to Revelation, <em>teaches no
other doctrine</em>, should the Israelites and Seventh-day Adventists
be correct. Both sides appeal to the Bible as their "infallible"
teacher. Let the Bible decide whether Saturday or Sunday be the day
enjoined by God. One of the two bodies must be wrong, and, whereas a
false position on this all-important question involves terrible
penalties, threatened by God Himself, against the transgressor of this
"perpetual covenant," we shall enter on the discussion of the merits of
the arguments wielded by both sides. Neither is the discussion of this
paramount subject above the capacity of ordinary minds, nor does it
involve extraordinary study. It resolves itself into a few plain
questions easy of solution:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st. Which day of the week does the Bible enjoin to be
kept holy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd. Has the New Testament modified by precept or practice
the original command?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd. Have Protestants, since the sixteenth century, obeyed
the command of God by keeping "holy" the day enjoined by their
infallible guide and teacher, the Bible? and if not, why not?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the above three questions we pledge ourselves to
furnish as many intelligent answers, which cannot fail to vindicate the
truth and uphold the deformity of error.</p>

        </center>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Conformably to our promise in our
last issue, we proceed to unmask one of the most flagrant errors and
most unpardonable inconsistencies of the Biblical rule of faith. Lest,
however, we be misunderstood, we deem it necessary to premise that
Protestantism recognizes no rule of faith, no teacher, save the
"infallible Bible." As the Catholic yields his judgment in spiritual
matters implicitly, and with the unreserved confidence, to the voice of
his church, so, too, the Protestant recognizes <em>no teacher but the
Bible</em>. All his spirituality is derived from its teachings. It is
to him the voice of God addressing him through his sole inspired
teacher. It embodies his religion, his faith, and his practice. The
language of Chillingworth, "The Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but
the Bible, is the religion of Protestants," is only one form of the
same idea multifariously convertible into other forms, such as "the
Book of God," "the Charter of Our Salvation," "the Oracle of Our
Christian Faith," "God's Text-Book to the race of Mankind," etc., etc.
It is, then, an incontrovertible fact that <em>the Bible alone</em> is
the teacher of Protestant Christianity. Assuming this fact, we will now
proceed to discuss the merits of the question involved in our last
issue. Recognizing what is undeniable, the fact of a direct
contradiction between the teaching and practice of Protestant
Christianity &#8212; the Seventh-day Adventists excepted &#8212; on the one hand,
and that of the Jewish people on the other, both observing different
days of the week for the worship of God, we will proceed to take the
testimony of the teacher common to both claimants, the Bible. The first
expression with which we come in contact in the Sacred Word, is found
in Gen., 2d chapter, 2d verse "And on the seventh day He (God) rested
from all His work which He had made." The next reference to this matter
is to be found in Exodus 20, where God commanded the seventh day to be
kept, <em> because</em> He had himself rested from the work of
creation on that day; and the sacred text informs us that <em>for that
reason</em> He desired it kept, in the following words; "<em>wherefore</em>,
the Lord blessed the seventh day and sanctified it." <a
 href="#footnote1">(1)</a> Again we read in 31st chapter, 15th verse:
"Six days you shall do work; in the seventh day is the Sabbath, the
rest holy to the Lord;" sixteenth verse: <em>"it is an everlasting
covenant," </em>"and a perpetual sign," "for in six days the Lord made
heaven and earth, and in the seventh He ceased from work."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Old Testament, reference is made one hundred and
twenty-six times to the Sabbath, and all these texts conspire
harmoniously in voicing the will of God commanding the seventh day to
be kept, because God Himself <em>first kept it,</em> making it
obligatory on all as <em> "a perpetual covenant." </em>Nor can we
imagine any one foolhardy enough to question the identity of Saturday
with the Sabbath or seventh day, seeing that the people of Israel have
been keeping the Saturday from the giving of the law, A.M. 2514 to A.D.
1893, a period of 3383 years. With the example of the Israelites before
our eyes today, there is no historical fact better established than
that referred to; viz., that the chosen people of God, the guardians of
the Old Testament, the living representatives of the only divine
religion hitherto, had for a period of 1490 years anterior to
Christianity, preserved the weekly practice the living tradition of the
correct interpretation of the special day of the week, Saturday, to be
kept "holy to the Lord," which tradition they have extended by their
own practice to an additional period of 1893 years more, thus covering
the full extent of the Christian dispensation. We deem it necessary to
be perfectly clear on this point, for reasons that will appear more
fully hereafter. The Bible &#8212; the Old Testament &#8212; confirmed by the
living tradition of a weekly practice for 3383 years by the chosen
people of God, teaches, then, with absolute certainty, that God had,
Himself, named the day to be "kept holy to Him",&#8212; that the day was
Saturday, and that any violation of that command was punishable with
death. "Keep you My Sabbath, for it is holy unto you; he that shall
profane it shall be put to death; he that shall do any work in it, his
soul shall perish in the midst of his people." Ex 31 ch. 14 v.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is impossible to realize a more severe penalty than
that so solemnly uttered by God Himself in the above text, on all who
violate a command referred to no less than one hundred and twenty-six
times in the old law. The ten commandments of the Old Testament are
formally impressed on the memory of the child of the Biblical Christian
as soon as possible, but there is not one of the ten made more
emphatically familiar, both in Sunday School and pulpit, than that of
keeping "holy" the Sabbath day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Having secured the absolute certainty the will of God as
regards the day to be kept holy, from His Sacred Word, <em>because</em>
He rested on that day, which day is confirmed to us by the practice of
His chosen people for thousands of years, we are naturally induced to
inquire <em>when and where</em> God changed the day for His worship;
for it is patent to the world that a change of day has taken place, and
inasmuch as no indication of such change can be found within the pages
of the Old Testament, nor in the practice of the Jewish people who
continue for nearly nineteen centuries of Christianity obeying the
written command, we must look to the exponent of the Christian
dispensation; viz., the New Testament, for the command of God canceling
the old Sabbath, Saturday.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We now approach a period covering little short of nineteen
centuries, and proceed to investigate whether the supplemental divine
teacher &#8212; the New Testament &#8212; contains a decree canceling the mandate
of the old law, and, at the same time, substituting a day for the
divinely instituted Sabbath of the old law, viz., Saturday; for,
inasmuch as Saturday was the day kept and ordered to be kept by God, <em>divine
authority alone</em>, under the form of a canceling decree, could
abolish the Saturday covenant, and another divine mandate, appointing
by name another day to be kept "holy," other than Saturday, is equally
necessary to satisfy the conscience of the Christian believer. The
Bible being the only teacher recognized by the Biblical Christian, the
Old Testament failing to point out a change of day, and yet another day
than Saturday being kept "holy" by the Biblical world, it is surely
incumbent on the reformed Christian to point out in the pages of the
New Testament the new divine decree repealing that of Saturday and
substituting that of Sunday, kept by the Biblicals since the dawn of
the Reformation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Examining the New Testament from cover to cover,
critically, we find the Sabbath referred to sixty-one times. We find,
too, that the Saviour invariably selected the Sabbath (Saturday) to
teach in the synagogues and work miracles. The four Gospels refer to
the Sabbath (Saturday) fifty-one times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In one instance the Redeemer refers to Himself as "the
Lord of the Sabbath," as mentioned by Matthew and Luke, <a
 href="#footnote2">(2)</a> but during the whole record of His life,
whilst invariably keeping and utilizing the day (Saturday), <em>He
never once hinted at a desire to change it</em>. His apostles and
personal friends afford to us a striking instance of their scrupulous
observance of it <em>after His death</em>, and, whilst His body was
yet in tomb, St. Luke, 23d chap. 56 verse informs us: "And they
returned and prepared spices and ointments, <em>and rested on the
sabbath day according to the commandment."</em> "but on the first day
of the week, very early in the morning, they came, bringing the spices
they had prepared." The "spices" and "ointments" had been prepared Good
Friday evening, because "the Sabbath drew near." 54 Verse. This action
on the part of the personal friends of the Saviour, proves beyond
contradiction that <em>after His death </em>they kept "holy" the
Saturday, <em>and regarded the Sunday as any other day of the week. </em>Can
anything, therefore, be more conclusive than the apostles and the holy
women never knew any Sabbath but Saturday, up to the day of Christ's
death?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We now approach the investigation of this interesting
question for the next thirty years, as narrated by the evangelist, St.
Luke, in his Acts of the Apostles. Surely some vestige of the canceling
act can be discovered in the practice of the Apostles during that
protracted period.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But, alas! we are once more doomed to disappointment. <em>Nine
        </em> <a href="#footnote3">(3)</a><em> times </em>do we find
the Sabbath referred to in the "Acts," but it is the <em>Saturday</em>
(the old Sabbath). Should our readers desire the proof, we refer them
to chapter and verse in each instance. Acts 13c., 14v.; again, same
chapter, 27v., again, 42v.; again, 44v. [Acts 13:14, 27, 42, 44] Once
more, 15c., 31v. [Acts16:13] Again, 17c., 2v.; [Acts 17:2] again 18c.,
4v. [Acts 18:4] "And he (Paul) reasoned in the synagogue <em>every
Sabbath,</em> and persuaded the Jews and Greeks." <em>thus the Sabbath
(Saturday) from Genesis to Revelation!!! </em>Thus, it is impossible
to find in the New Testament the slightest interference by the Saviour
or his Apostles with the original Sabbath, but on the contrary, an
entire acquiescence in the original arrangement; nay a <em>plenary </em><em>endorsement</em>
by Him, whilst living; and an unvaried, active participation <em>in
the keeping of that day and no other by the apostles, </em>for thirty
years after His death, as the Acts of the Apostles has abundantly
testified to us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the conclusion is inevitable; viz., that of those
who follow the Bible as their guide, the Israelites and Seventh-day
Adventists have exclusive weight of evidence on their side, whilst the
Biblical Protestant has not a word in self-defense for his substitution
of Sunday for Saturday. More anon.</p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; When his Satanic Majesty, who was
"a murder from the beginning," "and the father of lies," undertook to
open the eyes of our first mother, Eve, by stimulating her ambition,
"You shall be as gods, knowing good and evil," his action was but the
first of many plausible and successful efforts employed later, in the
seduction of millions of her children. Like Eve, they learn too late,
alas! the value of the inducements held out to allure her weak children
from allegiance to God. Nor does the subject matter of this discussion
form an exception to the usual tactics of his sable majesty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over three centuries since, he plausibly represented to a
large number of discontented and ambitious Christians the bright
prospect of the successful inauguration of a "new departure," by the
abandonment of the Church instituted by the Son of God, as their
teacher, and the assumption of a new teacher &#8212; <em>the Bible alone</em>
&#8212; as their newly fledged oracle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sagacity of the evil one foresaw but the brilliant
success of this maneuver. Nor did the result fall short of his most
sanguine expectations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A bold and adventurous spirit was alone needed to head the
expedition. Him his satanic majesty soon found in the apostate monk,
Luther, who himself repeatedly testifies to the close familiarity that
existed between his master and himself, in his "Table talk," and other
works published in 1558, at Wittenberg, under the inspection of
Melancthon. His colloquies with Satan on various occasions, are
testified to by Luther himself &#8212; a witness worthy of all credibility.
What the agency of the serpent tended so effectually to achieve in the
garden, the agency of Luther achieved in the Christian world. <a

        <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; As the end proposed to himself by
the evil one in his raid on the church of Christ was the destruction of
Christianity, we are now engaged in sifting the means adopted by him to
insure his success therein. So far, they have been found to be
misleading, self-contradictory, and fallacious. We will now proceed
with the further investigations of this imposture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Having proved to a demonstration that the Redeemer, <em>in
no instance,</em> had, during the period of His life, deviated from the
faithful observance of the Sabbath (Saturday), referred to by the four
evangelists fifty-one times, although He had designated Himself "Lord
of the Sabbath," He never having <em>once,</em> by command or
practice, hinted at a desire on His part to change the day by the
substitution of another and having called special attention to the
conduct of the apostles and the holy women, the very evening of His
death, securing beforehand spices and ointments to be used in embalming
His body the morning after the Sabbath (Saturday), as St. Luke so
clearly informs us (Luke 24 ch. 1v.), thereby placing beyond
peradventure, the divine action and will of the Son of God during life
by keeping the Sabbath steadfastly; and having called attention to the
action of His living representatives after his death, as proved by St.
Luke; having also placed before our readers <em>the indisputable fact</em>
that the apostles for the following thirty years (Acts) never deviated
from the practice of their divine Master in this particular, as St.
Luke (Acts 18 ch., 4v.) assures us: "And he (Paul) reasoned in the
synagogues <em> every Sabbath</em> (Saturday), and persuaded the Jews
and the Greeks." The Gentile converts were, as we see from the text,
equally instructed with the Jews, to keep the Saturday, having been
converted to Christianity on that day, "the Jews and the Greeks"
collectively.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Having also called attention to the texts of the Acts
bearing on the exclusive use of the Sabbath by the Jews and Christians
for thirty years after the death of the Saviour as the <em>only</em>
day of the week observed by Christ and His apostles, which period <em>exhausts
the inspired record,</em> we now proceed to supplement our proofs that
the Sabbath (Saturday) enjoyed this exclusive privilege, by calling
attention to <em>every instance</em> wherein the sacred record refers
to the first day of the week.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="1st Sunday"></a>The <i>first</i> reference to
Sunday after the resurrection of Christ is to be found in St. Luke's
Gospel, 24 ch., from 33 to 40 vs., and in St. John's 20 ch., 19 v.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The above texts themselves refer to the sole motive of
this gathering of the part of the apostles. It took place on the day of
the resurrection (Easter Sunday), not for the purpose of inaugurating
"the new departure" from the old Sabbath (Saturday) by keeping "holy"
the new day, for there is not a hint given of prayer, exhortation, or
the reading of the Scriptures, but it indicates the utter
demoralization of the apostles by informing mankind that they were
huddled together in that room in Jerusalem <em>"for fear of the Jews,"</em>
as St. John, quoted above, plainly informs us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="2nd Sunday"></a>The second reference to Sunday
is to be found in St. John's Gospel, 20th chapter, 26th to 29th verses:
And after eight days, the disciples were again within, and Thomas with
them." The resurrected Redeemer availed Himself of this meeting of all
the apostles to confound the incredulity of Thomas, who had been absent
from the gathering on Easter Sunday evening. This would have furnished
a golden opportunity to the Redeemer to change the day in the presence
of all His apostles, but we state the simple fact that, on this
occasion, as on Easter day, not a word is said of prayer, praise, or
reading of the Scriptures. <a name="3rd Sunday"></a>The third instance
on record, wherein the apostles were assembled on Sunday, is to be
found in Acts, 2d chapter, 1st verse: "The apostles were all of one
accord in one place." (Feast of Pentecost &#8212; Sunday.) Now, will this
text afford to our Biblical Christian brethren a vestige of hope that
Sunday substitutes, at length, Saturday? For when we inform them that
the Jews had been keeping <em>this Sunday</em> for 1500 years, and
have been keeping it for eighteen centuries after the establishment of
Christianity, at the same time keeping the weekly Sabbath, there is not
to be found either consolation or comfort in this text. Pentecost is
the fiftieth day after the Passover, <a href="#footnote5">(5)</a>
which was called the Sabbath of weeks, consisting of seven times seven
days; and the day after the completion of the seventh weekly Sabbath
day, was the chief day of the entire festival, necessarily Sunday. What
Israelite would not pity the cause that would seek to discover the
origin of the keeping of the first day of the week in his festival of
Pentecost, that has been kept by him yearly for over 3,000 years? Who
but the Biblical Christian, driven to the wall for a pretext to excuse
his sacrilegious desecration of the Sabbath, always kept by Christ and
His apostles, would have resorted to the Jewish festival of Pentecost
for his act of rebellion against his God and his teacher, the Bible?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="4th Sunday"></a>Once more, the Biblical
apologists for the change of day call our attention to the Acts, 20th
chapter&nbsp; 6th and 7th verses: <em>"and upon the first day of the
week,</em> when the disciples came together to break bread," etc. To
all appearances, the above text should furnish some consolation to our
disgruntled Biblical friends, but being Marplot, we cannot allow them
even this crumb of comfort. We reply by the axiom: <em>"Quod probat
nimis, probat nihil"</em> &#8212; "What proves too much, proves nothing." Let
us call attention to the same Acts 2d chapter, 46th verse: "And they,
continuing <em>daily</em> in the temple, and breaking bread from house
to house," etc. Who does not see at a glance that the text produced to
prove the exclusive prerogative of Sunday, vanishes into thin air &#8212; an <em>ignis
fatuus</em> &#8212; when placed in juxtaposition with the 46th verse of the
same chapter? What the Biblical Christian claims by this text for <em>Sunday
alone,</em> the same authority, St. Luke, informs us was <em>common to
every day of the week: </em>"And they, continuing <em>daily</em> in
the temple, and breaking bread from house to house."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="5th Sunday"></a>One text more presents itself,
apparently leaning toward a substitution of Sunday for Saturday. It is
taken from St. Paul's&nbsp; 1 Ep. Cor. 16th chapter, 1st and 2d verses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now concerning the collection for the saints," "On the
first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store," etc.
Presuming that the request of St. Paul had been strictly attended to,
let us call attention to what had been done each Saturday during the
Saviour's life and continued for thirty years after, as the book of
Acts informs us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Acts 18:4"></a>The followers of the Master met <em>"every
Sabbath"</em> to hear the word of God; the Scriptures were read <em>
"every Sabbath day."</em> "And Paul, as his manner was to reason in the
synagogue <em>every Sabbath</em>, interposing the same of the Lord
Jesus Christ," etc., Acts 18th chapter 4th verse. What more absurd
conclusion that to infer that reading of the Scriptures, prayer,
exhortation, and preaching, which <em>formed the routine duties of
every Saturday, </em> as had been abundantly proved, were overslaughed
by a request to take up a collection on <em>another day of the week?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>In order to appreciate fully the value of this text
now under consideration, it is only needful to recall the action of the
apostles and holy women on Good Friday before sundown. They brought
spices and ointments after He was taken down from the cross; they
suspended all action until the Sabbath "holy to the Lord" had passed,
and then took steps on Sunday morning to complete the process of
embalming the sacred body of Jesus. Why, may we ask, did they not
proceed to complete the work of embalming on Saturday? &#8212; Because they
knew well that the embalming of the sacred body of their Master would
interfere with the strict observance of the Sabbath, the keeping of
which was paramount; and until it can be shown that the Sabbath day <em>immediately
preceding the Sunday of our text </em>had not been kept (which would
be false, inasmuch <em>as every Sabbath had been kept</em>), the
request of St. Paul to make the collection <em>on Sunday</em> remains
to be classified with the work of the embalming of Christ's body, which
could not be effected on the Sabbath, and was consequently deferred to
the next convenient day; viz., Sunday, or the first day of the week.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Having disposed of every text to be found in the New
Testament referring to the Sabbath (Saturday), and to the first day of
the week (Sunday); and having shown conclusively from these texts,
that, so far, not a shadow of pretext can be found in the Sacred Volume
for the Biblical substitution of Sunday for Saturday; it only remains
for us to investigate the meaning of the expressions "Lord's Day," and
"day of the Lord," to be found in the New Testament, which we propose
to do in our next article, and conclude with apposite remarks on the
incongruities of a system of religion which we shall have proved to be
indefensible, self-contradictory, and suicidal.</p>

        <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present article we propose
to investigate carefully a new (and the last) class of proof assumed to
convince the Biblical Christian that God had substituted Sunday for
Saturday for His worship in the new law, and that the divine will is to
be found recorded by the Holy Ghost in apostolic writings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are informed that this radical change has found
expression, over and over again, in a series of texts in which the
expression, "the day of the Lord," or "the Lord's day," is to be found.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The class of texts in the New Testament, under the title
"Sabbath," numbering 61 in the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles; and the
second class, in which "the first day of the week," or Sunday, having
been critically examined (the latter class numbering nine [eight]); and
having been found not to afford the slightest clue to a change of will
on the part of God as to His day of worship by man, we now proceed to
examine the third and last class of texts relied on to save the
Biblical system from the arraignment of seeking to palm off on the
world, in the name of God, a decree for which there is not the
slightest warrant or authority from their teacher, the Bible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="1st Lords"></a>The first text of this class is
to be found in the Acts of the Apostles, 2d chapter, 20th verse: "The
sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that
great and notable day of the Lord shall come." How many Sundays have
rolled by since that prophecy was spoken? So much for that effort to
pervert the meaning of the sacred text from the judgment day to Sunday!
        <a name="2nd Lords"></a>The second text of this class is to be
found in 1st Epistle Cor., 1st chapter 8th verse: "Who shall also
confirm you unto the end, that you may be blameless <em>in the day of
our Lord Jesus Christ." </em>What simpleton does not see that the
apostle here plainly indicates the day of judgment? <a name="3rd Lords"></a>The
next text of this class that presents itself is to be found in the same
Epistle, 5th chapter 5th verse: "To deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved <em>in the day
of the Lord Jesus."</em> The incestuous Corinthian was, of course,
saved on <em>the Sunday next following!!</em> How pitiable such a
makeshift as this! <a name="4th Lords"></a>The fourth text, 2d Cor.,
1st chapter, 13th and 14th verse: "And I trust ye shall acknowledge
even to the end, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord
Jesus." <em>Sunday or the day of judgment,</em> which? <a
 name="5th Lords"></a>The fifth text is from St. Paul to the
Philippians, 1st chapter, 6th verse: "Being confident of this very
thing, that He who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it <em>until
the day of Jesus Christ."</em> The good people of Philippi, in
attaining perfection <em>on the following Sunday,</em> could afford to
laugh at our modern rapid transit!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="6th Lords"></a>We beg to submit our sixth of the
class; viz., Philippians, first chapter, tenth verse: "That he may be
sincere without offense unto <em>the day of Christ."</em> That day was
        <em>next Sunday,</em> forsooth! no so long to wait after all, <a
 name="7th Lords"> </a>The seventh text, 2 Ep. Peter, third chapter,
tenth verse. "But <em> the day of the Lord</em> will come as a thief
in the night." The application of this text to Sunday passes the bounds
of absurdity. <a name="8th Lords"></a>The eighth text, 2 Ep. Peter,
third chapter, twelfth verse: "Waiting for and hastening unto <em>the
coming of the day of the Lord,</em> by which the heavens being on fire,
shall be dissolved," etc. This day of the Lord is the same referred to
in the previous text, the application of both of which <em>to Sunday
next</em> would have left the Christian world sleepless the next
Saturday night. We have presented to our readers eight of the nine
texts relied on to bolster up by text of Scripture the sacrilegious
effort to palm off the "Lord's day" for Sunday, and with what result?
Each furnishes <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the last day,
referring to it directly, absolutely, and unequivocally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="9th Lords"></a>The ninth text wherein we meet
the expression "the Lord's day," is the last to be found in the
apostolic writings. The Apocalypse, or Revelation, first chapter, tenth
verse, furnishes it in the following words of John: "I was in the
Spirit on the Lord's day;" but it will afford no more comfort to our
Biblical friends than its predecessors of the same series. Has St. John
used the expression previously in his Gospel or Epistles? &#8212;
Emphatically, NO. Has he had occasion to refer to Sunday hitherto?
&#8212;Yes, twice. How did he designate Sunday on these occasions? Easter
Sunday was called by him (John 20:1) <em>"the first day of the week." </em>Again,
chapter twenty, nineteenth verse: "Now when it was late that same day, <em>being
the first day of the week."</em> Evidently, although inspired, both in
his Gospel and Epistles, he called Sunday "the first day of the week."
On what grounds, then, can it be assumed that he dropped that
designation? Was he <em>more inspired</em> when he wrote the
Apocalypse, or did he adopt a new title for Sunday, because it was now
in vogue? A reply to these questions would be supererogatory especially
to the latter, seeing that the same expression had been used eight
times already by St. Luke, St. Paul and St. Peter, <em>all under
divine inspiration,</em> and surely the Holy Spirit would not inspire
St. John to call Sunday the Lord's day, whilst He inspired Sts. Luke,
Paul, and Peter, collectively, to entitle the day of judgment "the
Lord's day." Dialecticians reckon amongst the infallible motives of
certitude, the moral motive of analogy or induction, by which we are
enabled to conclude with certainty from the known to the unknown; being
absolutely certain of the meaning of an expression can have only the
same meaning when uttered the ninth time, especially when we know that
on the nine occasions the expressions were <em>inspired by the Holy
Spirit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Nor are the strongest intrinsic grounds wanting to
prove that this, like its sister texts, contains the same meaning. St.
John (Apoc. first chapter, tenth verse) says "I was in the Spirit on
the Lord's day; "but he furnishes us the key to this expression,
chapter four, first and second verses: "After this I looked and behold
a door opened in heaven." A voice said to him: "Come up hither, and I
will show you <em>the things which must be hereafter."</em> Let us
ascend in spirit with John. Whither? &#8212; through that "door in heaven,"
to heaven. And what shall we see? &#8212; "The things that must be
hereafter," chapter four, first verse. He ascended in spirit to heaven.
He was ordered to write, in full, his vision of what is to take place
antecedent to, and concomitantly with, "the Lord's day," or the day of
judgment; the expression "Lord's day" being confined in Scripture to
the day of judgment exclusively.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have studiously and accurately collected from the New
Testament every available proof that could be adduced in favor of a law
canceling the Sabbath day of the old law, or one substituting another
day for the Christian dispensation. We have been careful to make the
above distinction, lest it might be advanced that the 3rd <a
 href="#footnote6"> (6)</a> Commandment was abrogated under the New
Law. <a name="Herald"> </a>Any such plea has been overruled by the
action of the Methodist Episcopal bishops in their Pastoral 1874, and
quoted by the New York <em> Herald</em> of the same date, of the
following tenor: "The Sabbath instituted in the beginning and confirmed
again and again by Moses and the prophets, <em>has never been
abrogated. </em>A part of the moral law, not a part or tittle of its
sanctity has been taken away." The above official pronunciamento has
committed that large body of Biblical Christians to the permanence of
the 3rd commandment under the new law. We again beg to leave to call
the special attention of our readers to the twentieth of "the
thirty-nine articles of religion" of the Book of Common Prayer; "It is
not lawful for the church to ordain anything that is contrary to <em>God's
written word.</em>"</p>

        <p align="center">CONCLUSION.</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; We have in this series of
articles, taken much pains for the instruction of our readers to
prepare them by presenting a number of <em>undeniable facts</em> found
in the word of God to arrive at a conclusion absolutely irrefragable.
When the Biblical system put in an appearance in the sixteenth century,
it not only seized on the temporal possessions of the Church, but in
its vandalic crusade stripped Christianity, as far as it could, of all
the sacraments instituted by its Founder, of the holy sacrifice, etc.,
etc., retaining nothing but the Bible, which its exponents pronounced <em>their
sole teacher</em> in Christian doctrine and morals. Chief amongst their
articles of belief was, and is today, the permanent necessity of
keeping the Sabbath holy. In fact, it has been for the past 300 years
the only article of the Christian belief in which there has been a
plenary consensus of Biblical representatives. The keeping of the
Sabbath constitutes the sum and substance of the Biblical theory. The
pulpits resound weekly with incessant tirades against the lax manner of
keeping the Sabbath in Catholic countries, as contrasted with the
proper, Christian, self-satisfied mode of keeping the day in Biblical
countries. Who can ever forget the virtuous indignation manifested by
the Biblical preachers throughout the length and breadth of our
country, from every Protestant pulpit, as long as yet undecided; and
who does not know today, that one sect, to mark its holy indignation at
the decision, has never yet opened the boxes that contained its
articles at the World's Fair?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; These superlatively good and unctuous Christians, by
conning over their Bible carefully, can find their counterpart in a
certain class of unco-good people in the days of the Redeemer, who
haunted Him night and day, distressed beyond measure, and scandalized
beyond forbearance, because He did not keep the Sabbath in as
straight-laced manner as themselves.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They hated Him for using common sense in reference to the
day, and He found no epithets expressive enough of His supreme contempt
for their Pharisaical pride. And it is very probably that the divine
mind has not modified its views today anent the blatant outcry of their
followers and sympathizers at the close of this nineteenth century. But
when we add to all this the fact that whilst the Pharisees of old kept
the <em>true Sabbath,</em> our modern Pharisees, counting on the
credulity and simplicity of their dupes, <em>have never once in their
lives kept the true Sabbath</em> which their divine Master kept to His
dying day, and which His apostles kept, after His example, for thirty
years afterward, according to the Sacred Record.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This most glaring contradiction, involving a deliberate
sacrilegious rejection of a most positive precept, is presented to us
today in the action of the Biblical Christian world. The Bible and the
Sabbath constitute the watchword of Protestantism; but we have
demonstrated that it is <em>the Bible against their Sabbath.</em> We
have shown that no greater contradiction ever existed than their theory
and practice. We have proved that neither their Biblical ancestors nor
themselves have ever kept one Sabbath day in their lives. The
Israelites and Seventh-day Adventists are witnesses of their weekly
desecration of the day named by God so repeatedly, and whilst they have
ignored and condemned their teacher, the Bible, they have adopted a day
kept by the Catholic Church. What Protestant can, after perusing these
articles, with a clear conscience, continue to disobey the command of
God, <em> enjoining Saturday to be kept,</em> which command his
teacher, the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, records as the will of
God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The history of the world cannot present a more stupid,
self-stultifying specimen of dereliction of principle than this. The
teacher demands emphatically in every page that the law of the Sabbath
be observed every week, by all recognizing it as "the only infallible
teacher," whilst the disciples of that teacher have not once for over
three hundred years observed the divine precept! That immense concourse
of Biblical Christians, the Methodists, have declared that the Sabbath
has never been abrogated, whilst the followers of the Church of
England, together with her daughter, the [pg. 9] Episcopal Church of
the United States, are committed by the twentieth article of religion,
already quoted, to the ordinance that the Church cannot lawfully ordain
anything <em>"contrary to God's written word."</em> God's written word
enjoins His worship to be observed on <em>Saturday</em> absolutely,
repeatedly, and most emphatically, with a most positive threat of death
to him who disobeys. All the Biblical sects occupy the same
self-stultifying position which no explanation can modify, much less
justify.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How truly do the words of the Holy Spirit apply to this
deplorable situation! <em>"Iniquitas mentita est sibi"</em> &#8212;
"Iniquity hath lied to itself." Proposing to follow <em>the Bible only</em>
as teacher, yet before the world, <em>the sole teacher </em>is
ignominiously thrust aside, and the teaching and practice of the
Catholic Church &#8212; "the mother of abomination," when it suits their
purpose so to designate her &#8212; adopted, despite the most terrible
threats pronounced by God Himself against those who disobey the
command, "Remember to keep holy the Sabbath."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before closing this series of articles, we beg to call the
attention of our readers once more to our caption, introductory of
each; viz., 1st&#8212;The Christian Sabbath, the genuine offspring of the
union of the Holy Spirit with the Catholic Church His spouse. 2nd&#8212;The
claim of Protestantism to any part therein proved to be groundless,
self-contradictory, and suicidal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first proposition needs little proof. The Catholic
Church for over one thousand years before the existence of a
Protestant, by virtue of her divine mission, changed the day from
Saturday to Sunday. We say by virtue of her divine mission, because He
who called Himself the "Lord of the Sabbath," endowed her with His own
power to teach, "he that heareth you, heareth Me;" commanded all who
believe in Him to hear her, under penalty of being placed with "heathen
and publican;" and promised to be with her to the end of the world. She
holds her charter as teacher from Him &#8212; a charter as infallible as
perpetual. The Protestant world at its birth found the Christian
Sabbath too strongly entrenched to run counter to its existence; it was
therefore placed under the necessity of acquiescing in the arrangement,
thus implying the Church's right to change the day, for over three
hundred years. The Christian Sabbath is therefore <em>to this day,</em>
the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church as spouse of the Holy
Ghost, without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now, however, take a glance at our second
proposition, with <em>the Bible alone</em> as the teacher and guide in
faith and morals. This teacher <em>most emphatically forbids any
change in the day for paramount reasons.</em> The command calls for a <em>"perpetual
covenant."</em> The day commanded to be kept by the teacher <em>has
never once been kept,</em> thereby developing an apostasy from an
assumedly fixed principle, as self-contradictory, self-stultifying, and
consequently as suicidal as it is within the power of language to
express. Nor are the limits of demoralization yet reached. Far from it.
        <em>Their pretense</em> for leaving the bosom of the Catholic
Church was for apostasy from the truth <em>as taught in the written
word.</em> They adopted the written word as their sole teacher, which
they had no sooner done than they abandoned it promptly, as these
articles have abundantly proved; and by a perversity as willful as
erroneous, they accept the teaching of the Catholic Church in direct
opposition to the plain, unvaried, and constant teaching of their sole
teacher in the most essential doctrine of their religion, thereby
emphasizing the situation in what may be aptly designated <i>"a
mockery, a delusion, and a snare."</i></p>

              <td>[<em>ADVENTIST</em> EDITORS' NOTE. &#8212; It was upon this very point that
the Reformation was condemned by the Council of Trent. The Reformers
had constantly charged, as here stated, that the Catholic Church had
"apostatized from the truth <em>as contained in the written word.</em>
"The written word," "The Bible and the Bible only," "Thus saith the
Lord," these were their constant watchwords; and "the Scripture, as in
the written word, the sole standard of appeal," this was the proclaimed
platform of the Reformation and of Protestantism. "The Scripture <em>and
tradition."</em> The Bible as interpreted by the Church and according
to the unanimous consent of the Fathers," this was the position and
claim of the Catholic Church. This was the main issue in the Council of
Trent, which was called especially to consider the questions that had
been raised and forced upon the attention of Europe by the Reformers.
The very first question concerning faith that was considered by the
council was the question involved in this issue. There was a strong
party even of the Catholics within the council who were in favor of
abandoning tradition and adopting <em>the Scriptures only,</em> as the
standard of authority. This view was so decidedly held in the debates
in the council that the pope's legates actually wrote to him that there
was "a strong tendency to set aside tradition altogether and to make
Scripture the sole standard of appeal." But to do this would manifestly
be to go a long way toward justifying the claims of the Protestants. By
this crisis there was developed upon the ultra-Catholic portion of the
council the task of convincing the others that "Scripture <em>and
tradition"</em> were the only sure ground to stand upon. If this could
be done, the council could be carried to issue a decree condemning the
Reformation, otherwise not. The question was debated day after day,
until the council was fairly brought to a standstill. Finally, after a
long and intensive mental strain, the Archbishop of Reggio came into
the council with substantially the following argument to the party who
held for Scripture alone: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Protestants claim to stand upon the written word
only. They profess to hold the Scripture alone as the standard of
faith. They justify their revolt by the plea that the Church has
apostatized from the written word and follows tradition. Now the
Protestants claim, that they stand upon the written word only, is not
true. Their profession of holding the Scripture alone as the standard
of faith, is false. PROOF: The written word explicitly enjoins the
observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath. They do not observe the
seventh day, but reject it. If they do truly hold the scripture alone
as their standard, they would be observing the seventh day as is
enjoined in the Scripture throughout. Yet they not only reject the
observance of the Sabbath enjoined in the written word, but they have
adopted and do practice the observance of Sunday, for which they have
only the tradition of the Church. Consequently the claim of 'Scripture
alone as the standard,' <em> fails;</em> and the doctrine of
'Scripture <em>and tradition'</em> as essential, is fully established,
the Protestants themselves being judges."
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; [The Archbishop of Reggio (Gaspar
[Ricciulli] de Fosso) made his speech at the last opening session of
Trent, (17th Session) reconvened under a new pope (Pius IV), on the
18th of January, 1562 after having been suspended in 1552. &#8212; J. H.

cols. 529, 530</a>. Latin.]</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no getting around this, for the
Protestants' own statement of faith &#8212; the Augsburg Confession, 1530 &#8212;
had clearly admitted that "the observation of the Lord's day" had been
appointed by "the Church" only.</p>

example whereof they make more than concerning the changing of the
Sabbath-day. Great, say they, is the power of the Church, since it has
dispensed with one of the Ten Commandments! ]</p>
              </blockquote>
              </font>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument was hailed in the council as
of Inspiration only; the party for "Scripture alone," surrendered; and
the council at once unanimously condemned Protestantism and the whole
Reformation as only an unwarranted revolt from the communion and
authority of the Catholic Church; and proceeded, April 8, 1546, "to the
promulgation of two decrees, the first of which, enacts under anathema,
that Scripture <em>and tradition</em> are to be received and venerated
equally, and that the deutero-canonical [the apocryphal] books are part
of the canon of Scripture. The second decree declares the Vulgate to be
the sole authentic and standard Latin version, and gives it such
authority as to supersede the original texts; forbids the
interpretation of Scripture contrary to the sense received by the
Church, 'or even contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers,'"
etc. <a href="#footnote7">(7)</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the inconsistency of the Protestant practice with
the Protestant profession that gave to the Catholic Church her
long-sought and anxiously desired ground upon which to condemn
Protestantism and the whole Reformation movement as only a selfishly
ambitious rebellion against the Church authority. And in this vital
controversy the key, the chiefest and culminative expression, of the
Protestant inconsistency was in the rejection of the Sabbath of the
Lord, the seventh day, enjoined in the Scriptures, and the adoption and
observance of the Sunday as enjoined by the Catholic Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is today the position of the respective parties
to this controversy. Today, as this document shows, this is the vital
issue upon which the Catholic Church arraigns Protestantism, and upon
which she condemns the course of popular Protestantism as being
"indefensible", self-contradictory, and suicidal." What will these
Protestants, what will this Protestantism, do?]</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; These articles are reprinted, and this leaflet
is sent forth by the publishers, because it gives from an undeniable
source and in no uncertain tone, the latest phase of the
Sunday-observance controversy, which is now, and which indeed for some
time has been, not only a national question with the leading nations,
but also an international question. Not that we are glad to have it so;
        <i>we would that it were otherwise.</i> We would that
Protestants everywhere were so thoroughly consistent in profession and
practice that there could be no possible room for the relations between
them and Rome ever to take the shape which they have now taken.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the situation in this matter is now as it is herein
set forth. There is no escaping this fact. It therefore becomes the
duty of the <b> <a href="http://www.irla.org/">International Religious
Liberty Association</a></b> to make known as widely as possible the
true phase of this great question as it now stands. Not because we are
pleased to have it so, but because it is so, whatever we or anybody
else would or would not be pleased to have.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that we have been looking for years for this
question to assume precisely the attitude which it has now assumed, and
which is so plainly set forth in this leaflet. We have told the people
repeatedly, and Protestants especially, and yet more especially have we
told those who were advocating Sunday laws and the recognition and
legal establishment of Sunday by the United States, that in the course
that was being pursued they were playing directly into the hands of
Rome, and that as certainly as they succeeded, they would inevitably be
called upon by Rome, and Rome in possession of power too, to render to
her an account as to why Sunday should be kept. This, we have told the
people for years, would surely come. And now that it <em>has</em>
come, it is only our duty to make it known as widely as it lies in our
power to do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be asked, Why did not Rome come out as boldly as
this before? Why did she wait so long? It was not for her interest to
do so before. When she should move, she desired to move with power, and
power as yet she did not have. But in their strenuous efforts for the
national, governmental recognition and establishment of Sunday, the
Protestants of the United States were doing more for her than she could
possibly do for herself in the way of getting governmental power into
her hands. This she well knew, and therefore only waited. And now that
the Protestants, in alliance with her, have accomplished the awful
thing, she at once rises up in all her native arrogance and old-time
spirit, and calls upon the Protestants to answer to her for their
observance of Sunday. This, too, she does because she is secure in the
power which the Protestants have so blindly placed in her hands. In
other words, the power which the Protestants have thus put into her
hands she will now use to their destruction. Is any other evidence
needed to show that the <em>Catholic Mirror </em>(which means the
Cardinal and the Catholic Church in America) has been waiting for this,
than that furnished on page 21 of this leaflet? Please turn back and
look at that page, and see that quotation clipped from the New York <a
 href="#Herald"><em>Herald</em></a> in 1874, and which is now brought
forth thus. Does not this show plainly that that statement of the
Methodist bishops, the <em>Mirror,</em> all these nineteen years, has
been keeping for just such a time as this? And more than this, the
Protestants will find more such things which have been so laid up, and
which will yet be used in a way that will both surprise and confound
them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This at present is a controversy between the Catholic
Church and Protestants. As such only do we reproduce these editorials
of the CATHOLIC MIRROR. The points controverted are points which are
claimed by Protestants as in their favor. The argument is made by the
Catholic Church; the answer devolves upon those Protestants who observe
Sunday, not upon us. We can truly say, "This is none of our funeral."
If they do not answer, she will make their silence their confession
that she is right, and will act toward them accordingly. If they do
answer, she will use against them their own words, and as occasion may
demand, the power which they have put into her hands. So that, so far
as she is concerned, whether the Protestant answer or not, it is all
the same. And how she looks upon them henceforth is clearly manifested
in the challenge made in the last paragraph of the reprint articles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is just one refuge left for the Protestants. that is
to take their stand squarely and fully upon the "written word only,"
"the Bible and the Bible alone," and thus upon the Sabbath of the Lord.
Thus acknowledging no authority but God's, wearing no sign but His
(Eze. 20:12, 20), obeying His command, and shielded by His power, they
shall have the victory over Rome and all her alliances, and stand upon
the sea of glass, bearing the harps of God, with which their triumph
shall be forever celebrated. (Revelation 18, and 15:2-4.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not yet too late for Protestants to redeem
themselves. Will they do it? Will they stand consistently upon the
Protestant profession? or will they still continue to occupy the
"indefensible, self-contradictory, and suicidal" position of professing
to be Protestants, yet standing on Catholic ground, receiving Catholic
insult, and bearing Catholic condemnation? Will they indeed take the
written word only, the Scripture alone, as their sole authority and
their sole standard? or will they still hold the "indefensible,
self-contradictory, and suicidal" doctrine and practice of following
the authority of the Catholic Church and of wearing the sign of her
authority? Will they keep the Sabbath of the Lord, the seventh day,
according to Scripture? or will they keep the Sunday according to the
tradition of the Catholic Church?<br>

sale in Chicago, New York, California, Tennessee, London, Australia,
Cape Town, Africa, and Ontario, Canada, together with the continuous
demand, have prompted the <em>Mirror</em> to give permanent form to
them, and thus comply with the demand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The pages of this brochure unfold to the reader one of the
most glaringly conceivable contradictions existing between the practice
and the theory of the Protestant world, and unsusceptible of any
rational solution, the theory claiming the Bible alone as teacher,
which unequivocally and most positively commands Saturday to be kept
'holy,' whilst their practice proves that they utterly ignore the
unequivocal requirements of their teacher, the Bible, and occupying
Catholic ground for three centuries and a half, by the abandonment of
their theory, they stand before the world today the representatives of
a system the most indefensible, self-contradictory, and suicidal that
can be imagined.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We feel that we cannot interest our readers more than to
produce the 'Appendix' <a href="#footnote8">(8)</a> which the
International Religious Liberty Association, and ultra-Protestant
organization, has added to the reprint of our articles. The perusal of
the Appendix will confirm the fact that our argument is unanswerable,
and that the only recourse left to the Protestants is either to retire
from Catholic territory where they have been squatting for three
centuries and a half, and accepting their own teacher, the Bible, in
good faith, as so clearly suggested by the writer of 'Appendix,'
commence forth-with to keep the Saturday, the day enjoined by the Bible
from Genesis to Revelation; or, abandoning the Bible as their sole
teacher, cease to be squatters, and a living contradiction of their own
principles, and taking out letters of adoption as citizens of the
kingdom of Christ on earth &#8212; His Church &#8212; be no longer victims of
self-delusive and necessary self-contradiction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "The arguments contained in this pamphlet are firmly
grounded on the word of God, and having been closely studied with the
Bible in hand, leave no escape for the conscientious Protestant except
the abandonment of Sunday worship and the return to Saturday, commanded
by their teacher, the Bible, or, unwilling to abandon the tradition of
the Catholic Church, which enjoins the keeping of Sunday, and which
they have accepted in direct opposition to their teacher, the Bible,
consistently accept her in all her teachings. Reason and common sense
demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives; either
Protestantism and the keeping of Saturday, or Catholicity and the
keeping of Sunday. Compromise is impossible."</p>

      <p align="center">&nbsp;<b>PREFACE</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The contents of this pamphlet embrace four
editorials which appeared in the columns of the CATHOLIC MIRROR in four
successive issues of the paper, viz: on the 3rd, 9th, 16th and 23d of
September, 1893. The unprecedented demand for copies of the above dates
soon exhausted the issues, whilst to meet all further requests a
reprint of them for the benefit of subscribers, availing ourselves of
the opportunity to furnish them to all applicants in the present form.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A reprint of these articles has been issued by the
International Religious Liberty Association, in Michigan, in a pamphlet
of thirty-two pages, available in London, England; Australia; Cape
Town, Africa; Toronto, Ontario; and in Michigan, New York, California
and Tennessee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the Protestant world evinces so profound an
interest in these Catholic productions, we feel that the Catholics of
the country should have within their reach arguments unanswerable by
the opponents of our religion, placing it in an impregnable position,
whilst they expose the utterly indefensible condition to which they
have reduced Protestantism. With this view of the matter, we
respectfully place its pages before our readers, anticipating both
profit and pleasure to them in their perusal.</p>
