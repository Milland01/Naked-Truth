Sunday.</font></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">On his nationally broadcast Bible Answer Man radio program
  on October 1st, 1998 Hank Hanegraaff was asked the following question by a
  caller: (<img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a href="BAM-ON-SABBATH.html"><b>Listen with
  RealPlayer</b></a>)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Caller</strong> - My sister-in-law read a book
    called <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> </font><font size="3"><strong><a
    href="http://www.seventh-day.org/Read_NSL.htm">The National Sunday Law</a></strong>,
    and now she is convinced that we are all worshipping on the wrong day, and I
    was wondering what you thought I could tell her as far as what the Sabbath
    is?</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Hank</strong> - Well, I think very important
    question, because they, of course, believe that if in fact you worship on
    Sunday, that is tantamount to have taken on the Mark of the Beast, and
    nothing could be farther from the truth. The reason that we worship on
    Sunday is because we are celebrating the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
    Christ which is the capstone in the arch of Christianity. And we are
    following a precedent that was set by the early Christian Church because
    this is the day that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. And this is not at all
    unique, because you see that the Sabbath was always a cycle: you have six
    days of work, one day of rest, and the day is not the issue. It is that by
    resting you are saying that God owns all of me, my time, talents and
    treasure. And so in Genesis the cycle was celebrated as a result of God's
    work in creation. In Exodus the sabbath was a reflection or a celebration of
    God's deliverance from the rule of Egypt. And as I said, the New Testament
    is a celebration of the most momentous event in the history of Christianity,
    and that is the resurrection from the dead. And Paul says &quot;Without this
    we have no hope for among all men most miserable we are still dead in our
    sins.&quot; I'd also point this out, because I think this is important,
    Sabbath observance was associated, by Moses the lawgiver, with the concept
    of redemption, and that redemption of course comes through Jesus Christ. So,
    what we have is the Sabbath as a shadow of the redemption that we would
    eventually have through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
    So what had happened, it was a momentous occasion that changed the day of
    worship. But the real issue was not the day you worship.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Caller</strong> - It is just that you do it?</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Hank</strong> - Yes!</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Caller</strong> - OK. OK. So when it is referring
    to the Sabbath it is not referring to a day, it is just saying,&nbsp; just
    worship a day, and take a day of rest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Hank</strong> - Yeah, and again, I don't have any
    problem what-so-ever with someone celebrating Saturday rather than Sunday.
    The real issue is if you are celebrating on Saturday like the Jews are,
    because they think Jesus Christ has not yet come, then you have a problem.
    But if it is a celebration of His coming, and then His resurrection from the
    dead, then that's completely biblical.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Caller</strong> - O.K. Is this book 
    <img
    src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> </font><strong><a
    href="http://www.seventh-day.org/Read_NSL.htm"><font size="3">The
    National Sunday Law</font></a></strong><font size="3"> pretty much a fluke
    then?</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Hank</strong> - Oh, its not only poorly written,
    and sensationalistic, I mean you have probably seen it haven't you?</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Caller</strong> - I have, you know, on the
    internet. She actually got one in the mail and read it and so she is, you
    know, totally convinced now, and I am trying to help her.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3"><strong>Hank</strong> - Well you can help her by giving
    her that information and also reading her the passage in 2nd&nbsp;
    Colossians, I think its Chapter 2 verse 16, where it says don't let anybody
    judge you by what you eat or drink or with regards to a religious festival,
    or a new moon celebration, or a sabbath day, these are a shadow of the
    things to come, the reality however is found in Christ. And that of course
    is what we are worshipping on Sunday.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">Bible Answer Man programs are produced and copyrighted by
  the <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> </font><a href="http://www.equip.org/"><font size="3"><strong>Christian
  Research Institute</strong></font></a><font size="3">, P.O. Box 7000, Rancho
  Santa Margarita, CA 92688-7000.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">So let us analyze what Hank Hanegraaff has said. He suggests
  to the caller, that the Sabbath was merely a cycle of six days of work and one
  day of rest, and that the particular day the New Testament Christian worships
  is not an issue, not as long as one day in seven is observed. It is not the
  day that matters, according to Hank, it is the cycle that is important, and
  keeping the Sunday in honor of the resurrection fulfils this cyclical
  obligation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3">Let's review God's commandment on this matter:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    Exo 20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    Exo 20:10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou
    shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
    nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
    gates:<br>
    Exo 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
    that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
    sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">The Commandment says <em>the</em> seventh day is the
  Sabbath, yet some may read the commandment and still think that only a seven
  day cycle was instituted by God and the Church was authorized to decide which
  day would be kept. This argument is also made by Catholic apologists:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot;God did not give Moses a calendar, and say,
    &quot;Here is where I want the counting of the days to begin.&quot; No, God
    left that for His authorized agents to determine. The day on which the
    counting of the seven days began is immaterial, provided the selection was
    made by an authority that functioned by divine will.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Source: <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <a
    href="http://www.catholic-dispatch.com/"><strong>Catholic Dispatch</strong></a>,
    letter 34 on the Sabbath (no longer online).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">Such a claim is has simply no basis in scripture, in fact,
  it blatantly contradicts scripture:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 16:23 And he [Moses] said unto them, This is that which <strong><em>the
    LORD hath said</em></strong>, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto
    the LORD:bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
    seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the
    morning.<br>
    Exo 16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did
    not stink, neither was there any worm therein.<br>
    Exo 16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the
    LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.<br>
    Exo 16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the
    seventh day for to gather, and they found none.<br>
    Exo 16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, <strong><em>How long refuse ye to
    keep my commandments and my laws?</em></strong><br>
    Exo 16:29 See, for that <em><strong>the LORD hath given you the sabbath</strong></em>,
    therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
    every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br>
    Exo 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>According to the Bible, for 40 years a double portion of manna fell on
  Friday, and no manna fell on the Sabbath day. Note that this began BEFORE the
  Ten Commandments were given to Moses on Sinai. The manna continued until the
  Israelites entered the promised land (Exodus 16:35, Joshua 5:12). With 52
  weeks a year, that means God made the seventh day Sabbath plain to them for <em>over</em>
  2000 weeks.&nbsp;No one was <em>ever</em> given a choice as to which day they
  would observe as the weekly day of rest. It was a day specified and declared
  by God as a Commandment<em><strong> </strong></em>-<em><strong> &quot;the LORD
  hath given you the sabbath</strong></em>&quot; - Moses was not given any
  choice in selecting the Sabbath day. A <em>specific</em> day was instituted by
  God at creation (Gen 2:2-3), is was not merely a cycle of rest every seventh
  day as suggested by Hank Hanegraaff and Roman Catholics.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Num 15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the
    wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.<br>
    Num 15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses
    and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.<br>
    Num 15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should
    be done to him.<br>
    Num 15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
    death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.<br>
    Num 15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned
    him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Violation of God's <em>specified</em> Sabbath was punished by the Lord by a
  death sentence! No one had the right to neglect or change the law of God and
  so break His Sabbath.</p>
  <p>Now, according to Hank, just who authorized the change from Saturday to
  Sunday?<font size="3"></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">&quot; ... we are following a precedent that was set by
    the early Christian Church because this is the day that Jesus Christ rose
    from the dead.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">So Hank actually recognizes, not the Bible, but Catholic
  Tradition and the authority of the Catholic Church to abolish the keeping of
  the Saturday Sabbath of God, specified in His commandment law, and instead
  substitute Sunday in its place. The Catholic Church surely must applaud Hank
  in his recognition of their presumed authority and Catholic Tradition. He
  might just as well have quoted from the Roman Catholic Catechism from the
  Council of Trent of the 16th century:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">THE SABBATH, WHY CHANGED TO SUNDAY</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Church of God has thought it well to transfer the
    celebration and observance of the Sabbath to Sunday.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For, as on that day light first shone on the world, so by
    the Resurrection of our Redeemer on the same day, by whom was thrown open to
    us the gate to eternal life, we were called out of darkness into light; and
    hence the Apostles would have it called <em>the Lord's day.</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; We also learn from the Sacred Scriptures that the first day of
    the week was held sacred because on that day the work of creation commenced,
    and on that day the Holy Ghost was given to the Apostles.</p>

  <p>The Bible Answer Man is in full agreement with the Catholic Council of
  Trent on this matter. Now note how this matter is discussed in another Roman
  Catholic Catechism from the 17th century:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <i>
    <p align="center">The Third Commandment Expounded.</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the third
    commandment?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Remember that thou keepest holy the sabbath day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did the Sabbath begin to be kept?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From the very creation of the world; for then God
    blessed the seventh day, and rested on it from all His works. <i>Gen</i>.
    ii. 2.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When was this commandment renewed?</p>
    <p>[pg. 58]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the Old Law; when God gave the commandments to <i>Moses</i>
    on mount <i>Sinai</i>, written with his own finger in two tables of stone, <i>Exod</i>.
    xx. 1, &amp;c. xxxi. 18.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was the <i>Jewish</i> Sabbath changed into the <i>Sunday</i>?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because <i>Christ</i> was born upon a <i>Sunday</i>,
    arose from the dead upon a <i>Sunday</i>, and sent down the Holy Ghost on a <i>Sunday:
    </i>works not inferior to the creation of the world.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By whom was it changed?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the Governors of the Church, the Apostles, who also
    kept it; for St. John was in spirit on the Lord’s day (which was Sunday.) <i>Apoc</i>.
    i. 10.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the Church hath power to command
    feasts and holydays?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the very act of changing the sabbath into <i>Sunday</i>,
    which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves,
    by keeping <i>Sunday</i> strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded
    by the same Church.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because by keeping <i>Sunday</i>, they acknowledge the
    Church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not
    keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.</p>

  Publishing House, 5 Barclay Street, New York, approved and recommended for his
  diocese by the Right Rev. Benedict, Bishop of Boston, April 24th, 1833, pages
  57, 58.</p>
  <p>And then there is this from a Roman Catholic Catechism of the 19th century:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 174]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <em>Have you any other way of proving that the
    Church has power to institute festivals of precept?</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Had she not such power, she could not have done that
    in which all modern religionists agree with her;—she could not have
    substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the
    observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no
    Scriptural authority.</p>
    <p><font size="3">[pg. 181]</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <em>In what manner can we show a
    Protestant, that he speaks unreasonably against fasts and abstinences?</em><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Ask him why he keeps Sunday, and not Saturday, as his
    day of rest, since he is unwilling either to fast or to abstain. If he
    reply, that the Scripture orders him to keep the Sunday, but says nothing as
    to fasting and abstinence, tell him the Scripture speaks of Saturday or the
    Sabbath, but gives no command anywhere regarding Sunday or the first day of
    the week. If, then, he neglects Saturday as a day of rest and holiness, and
    substitutes Sunday in its place, and this merely because such was the usage
    of the ancient Church, should he not, if he wishes to act consistently,
    observe fasting and abstinence, because the ancient Church so ordained?</font></p>

  York, Copyright 1876 by T. W. Strong, pages 174, 181.</p>
  <p>The Catholics point to the Sunday keeping Protestants and accuse them of
  blatant contradiction. The Protestant, they claim, has no more than the
  Catholic Church on which to base Sunday keeping, as it is not something found
  in Scripture. So what of the Protestants claim of Sola Scriptura, the Bible as
  the <em>only</em> ruler for doctrine? The Catholic must laugh at such a
  preposterous claim from the Protestant Sunday keeper. Note this from a Roman
  Catholic Catechism of the 20th century:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If we would consult the Bible only, without Tradition, we ought, for
    instance, still to keep holy the Saturday with the Jews, instead of Sunday
    ...</p>

  <p><font size="3">If you, Mr. <em>Bible Answer</em> Man, or any Protestant,
  wish to truly adhere to Sola Scriptura, the <em>Bible only</em> as your ruler
  for faith and doctrine, then you must clearly give up the proprietary Catholic
  ground of Sunday keeping, their claimed &quot;mark&quot; of authority <em>over
  the Bible</em>, and retire to the Lord's Saturday Sabbath according to His
  Commandment. On this point, the Roman Catholic Church is <em>entirely</em>
  correct:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the matter of Sabbath observance the Protestant
    rule of Faith is utterly unable to explain the substitution of the Christian
    Sunday for the Jewish Saturday. It has been changed. The Bible still teaches
    that the Sabbath or Saturday should be kept holy. There is no authority in
    the New Testament for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday. Surely it is
    an important matter. It stands there in the Bible as one of the Ten
    Commandments of God. There is no authority in the Bible for abrogating this
    Commandment, or for transferring its observance to another day of the week.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Catholics it is not the slightest difficulty.
    &quot;All power is given Me in heaven and on earth; as the Father sent Me so
    I also send you,&quot; said our Divine Lord in giving His tremendous
    commission to His Apostles. &quot;He that heareth you heareth Me.&quot; We
    have in the authoritative voice of the Church the voice of Christ Himself. <strong>The
    Church is above the Bible; and this transference of Sabbath observance to
    Sunday is proof positive of that fact.</strong> Deny the authority of the
    Church and you have no adequate or reasonable explanation or justification
    for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday in the Third - Protestant Fourth
    - Commandment of God.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the boldest thing, the most revolutionary
    change the Church ever did, happened in the first century. The holy day, the
    Sabbath, was changed from Saturday to Sunday. &quot;The Day of the
    Lord&quot; (dies Dominica) was chosen, not from any directions noted in the
    Scriptures, but from the Church's sense of its own power. The day of
    resurrection, the day of Pentecost, fifty days later, came on the first day
    of the week. So this would be the new Sabbath. People who think that the
    Scriptures should be the sole authority, should logically become 7th Day
    Adventists, and keep Saturday holy.</p>
