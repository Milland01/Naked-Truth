    Sabbath in the New Covenant, <i><span style="font-style: italic;">after</span></i>

    will or testament after the death of the testator is illegal and fraudulent 
    in <i><span style="font-style: italic;">any</span></i> court of law.<br>
    <br>
    Consider this. The purpose of a last will and testament is to <u>reveal the 
    names of those who will inherit</u>.&nbsp; The last will and testament of Jesus 
    Christ therefore includes a list of beneficiaries or inheritors. What do 
    they inherit? Eternal life and the

    <st1:placetype w:st="on">kingdom</st1:placetype> of
    <st1:placename w:st="on">God</st1:placename></st1:place>. This list or

    <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium">2 Cor 3:6&nbsp; He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not

  <p align="left"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
  <span style="font-size: medium">So the New Covenant differs in that it is not a covenant with

  faith that is </span> <i><span style="font-size: medium">automatically</span></i><span style="font-size: medium"> obedient to the spirit and will of God as 
  expressed in His Law. A true faith does not view God's Law as a burden to be

  and mind.</span></span></p>
  <p align="left" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: medium">The only difference in the New Covenant, as shown above, is 
  that the Law of God is now written in the hearts and minds of God's true 
  people, the people of faith who express their love of God by obedience to 
  God's Law:</p>
