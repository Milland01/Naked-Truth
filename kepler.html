of Robert Sungenis<br>
of Catholic Apologetics International</font></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>First, the Challenge offered by Robert Sungenis:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>CAI will write a check for $1,000 to the first person who can prove that 
    the earth revolves around the sun. (If you lose, then we ask that you make a 
    donation to the apostolate of CAI). Obviously, we at CAI don't think anyone 
    CAN prove it, and thus we can offer such a generous reward. In fact, we may 
    up the ante in the near future. </p>
    <p>You can submit your &quot;proofs&quot; to our e-mail address cairomeo@aol.com. We 
    will then offer a response. Both your &quot;proof&quot; and our response will be 
    posted on the CAI science page at our website. If you do not want your 
    actual name listed, we will change your name, but your contents will be 
    posted. If you do not want either your name or your contents posted, then 
    you are not eligible for a reply from CAI nor the $1,000 reward. CAI will be 
    the sole judge of whether you have successfully proven your case. But since 
    CAI is built on its reputation of honesty and truthfulness, rest assured 
    that if you do indeed prove your case, you will be rewarded the money. </p>
    <p>Now a word of caution. By &quot;proof&quot; we mean that your explanations must be 
    direct, observable, physical, natural, repeatable, unambiguous and 
    comprehensive. We don't want hearsay, popular opinion, &quot;expert&quot; testimony, 
    majority vote, personal conviction, organizational rulings, superficial 
    analogies, appeals to &quot;simplicity,&quot; &quot;apologies&quot; to Galileo, or any other 
    indirect means of persuasion which do not qualify as scientific proof. </p>
    <p>The $1,000 Challenge will go on indefinitely. So, if you're up for the 
    challenge, take your best shot! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><u><b>Submitted to CAI on 15 November 2002:</b></u></p>
  <p align="left">In reply I offer the following brief RealVideo clip:&nbsp;
  <font size="4"><a href="heliocentrism.html">Kepler Finds 
  Earth's Orbit Around the Sun</a> <br>
  </font>It is a clip from a program titled The Mechanical Universe -<b>
  <a href="http://www.themechanicaluniverse.com/mu121.htm?34,25">Kepler's Three 
  Laws</a></b>, and is copyright 1985 by the California Institute of Technology.</p>
  <p>Regarding your conditions of the proof:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><b>direct</b> - yes, the results of the computations apparently lead 
      directly to the conclusion that the Earth must orbit the sun, and not the 
      other way around.</li>
      <li><b>observable - </b>yes, Kepler reached his conclusion by observation 
      of the orbit of Mars, and the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun.</li>
      <li><b>physical</b> - yes, the conclusion was reached by direct 
      observation of the physical orbit of Mars</li>
      <li><b>natural - </b>yes, the conclusion was reached by direct observation 
      of the natural physical orbit of Mars</li>
      <li><b>repeatable</b> - yes, the experiment would be repeatable today 
      following the same procedure.</li>
      <li><b>unambiguous -</b> yes, I believe the video shows the results in an 
      unambiguous way that simply cannot be explained in a way compatible with 
      geocentrism.</li>
      <li><b>comprehensive</b> - well you got me there if you want an out, as I 
      am not actually providing any proof to you, but rather a graphic 
      demonstration that is the apparent <i>result</i> of the proof. To qualify 
      for comprehensive proof, I would have to provide you with the actual 
      computations and logic that Kepler used, in a way you could understand and 
      possibly refute, and I am admittedly not doing that. It is quite likely 
      that neither you or I could fathom the computations or complex geometry in 
      any case.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>So I release you from the need to pay off based on this video clip, 
      even if you decide to concede heliocentrism based on it alone, as unlikely 
      as I think that may be (unless, of course you just feel irresistibly 
      compelled to divest yourself of your $1000 with less than 100% of your 
      conditions being met absolutely).</p>
      <p>However, I do feel that this clip provides very strong evidence that 
      the proof you require <i>does</i> exist, and perhaps someone who is an 
      astrophysicist will be able to simplify the explanation enough to confirm 
      the proof to you, though you may still be able to come up with some 
      fantastic scenario that you feel is able to make it conform to 
      geocentrism. </p>

      those dates both the Sun and Mars are at the same fixed relative points, 
      with the same distance between them. The Earth's position changes relative 
      to both the Sun and Mars, tracing out an orbit around the Sun (proving 
      heliocentrism).</p>
      <p>(The blue orbital path is that of the comet Tempel-Tuttle, the dust 
      trail of which is responsible for the Leonid meteor showers in

    </blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p>Other points worth noting.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Venus and Mercury are never observed very far from the Sun. Venus is 
      always observed within 46<font face="Times New Roman">º and Mercury within 
      28º, so they are only observed in the early morning or early evening (they 
      basically rise and set with the sun). They are never seen on the opposite 
      side of the earth from the sun.<br>
&nbsp;</font></li>
      <li>Venus and Mercury exhibit the full range of phases, like the moon, but 
      the other planets do not. The reason for this is that Venus and Mercury 
      have orbits closer to the Sun than the Earth (inferior orbits), the other 
      planets have orbits farther away than the Earth (superior orbits).<br>
&nbsp;</li>
      <li><font face="Times New Roman">Venus and Mercury both exhibit a full / 
      gibbous (half to full) phase when observed in the direction of&nbsp; the 
      Sun (conjunction), but farthest from the Earth (smallest in the 
      telescope). If they orbited the Earth (geocentric), we would never see a 
      full phase when they are in the direction of the Sun, as illustrated 
      below. This proves that Venus and Mercury orbit the Sun, and not the 
      Earth. (<a href="http://www.venus-transit.de/PlanetPhases/">See this 
      animation</a>) <a href="http://members.tripod.com/paulknepp/ANAGRAM.htm">
      Galileo observed this first in late 1610</a>, and concluded that Venus 
      orbited the Sun. Geocentrism, he now knew, was wrong.</font></li>

    <tr>
      <td width="100%">Michael, thank you for your submission. But I'm sorry to 
      have to tell you that your diagrams don't at all prove your contention.
      <p>First, you might want to read up on the relationship between Kepler and 
      Tycho Brahe. You will find that it was Brahe who made all the meticulous 
      chartings of the planets, not Kepler. Kepler actually confiscated Brahe's 
      work after Brahe died. While Brahe was alive, he was using those very 
      calculations to show that Geocentrism was the correct model. Before he 
      died, Brahe insisted that Kepler use the calculations to continue the 
      Geocentric position. Kepler, however, was influenced by other things. 
      Since he was heavily into the occult, as was his mother, he was searching 
      for &quot;musical harmony&quot; among the heavenly bodies. It was his opinion that a 
      solar centered system coincided with that &quot;musical harmony&quot; as opposed to 
      a geo-centered system. As such, Kepler's choice had little to do with 
      evidence disproving the Geocentrism. The fact still remains that both 
      Heliocentrism and Geocentrism work, mathematically and physically. 
      Kepler's findings do nothing to disprove that fact. </p>
      <p>Second, we have already dealt with Kepler's claims in our Science 
      posts. I suggest that you consult them. </p>
      <p>The first is at www.catholicintl.com/epologetics/geo25.html. </p>
      <p>You wrote: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Now the following can be seen above: Observations are made on the 
        day that Mars returns to the exact same point in its orbit (here when it 
        crosses the yellow line at the right. On those dates both the Sun and 
        Mars are at the same fixed relative points, with the same distance 
        between them. The Earth's position changes relative to both the Sun and 
        Mars, tracing out an orbit around the Sun (proving heliocentrism). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is nothing more than the retrograde motion of Mars as seen from 
      earth. If you go to our posting on this subject you will see how 
      retrograde motion is explained in the Geocentric system, which is at </p>
      <p>www.catholicintl.com/epologetics/geo18.html. </p>
      <p>You then write: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;Other points worth noting. Venus and Mercury are never observed very 
        far from the Sun. Venus is always observed within 46º and Mercury within 
        28º, so they are only observed in the early morning or early evening 
        (they basically rise and set with the sun). They are never seen on the 
        opposite side of the earth from the sun. Venus and Mercury exhibit the 
        full range of phases, like the moon, but the other planets do not. The 
        reason for this is that Venus and Mercury have orbits closer to the Sun 
        than the Earth (inferior orbits), the other planets have orbits farther 
        away than the Earth (superior orbits). </p>
        <p>Venus and Mercury both exhibit a full / gibbous phase when observed 
        near the Sun, but farthest from the Earth. If they orbited the Earth 
        (geocentric), we would never see a full phase when they are near the 
        Sun. This proves that Venus and Mercury orbit the Sun, and not the 
        Earth. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The problem with this, Michael, is that you are working with an 
      incorrect model of the Geocentric system. In the Tychonic system, which we 
      are using, all the planets orbit the sun, not the earth. It is the sun 
      that orbits the earth, and carries the planets along with it. Thus, the 
      diagram you showed which has Venus orbiting the earth is wrong, and that 
      is why the model doesn't work for you. </p>
      <p>As for the Geocentric explanation of the phases of Venus, it can be 
      explained both from a Ptolemaic system and a Tychonic system. </p>
      <p>First the Ptolemaic system. </p>
      <p>Galileo had claimed that the Ptolemaic system could not account for the 
      phases of Venus or Mercury. Actually, Galileo was partially correct. If 
      one uses circular orbits for Venus and Mercury, the phases of the two 
      planets do not appear. But if one uses elliptical orbits, as even Kepler 
      did for the heliocentric system, then the phases of Venus and Mercury can 
      be easily accounted for in the Ptolemaic system. Even the Jesuit 
      astronomers who were challenging Galileo's findings knew this to be the 
      case, and thus they submitted their evidence to the Inquisition, which 
      also concluded that Galileo had no proof that only the heliocentric system 
      worked. In fact, the only thing that Galileo's findings showed was that 
      the epicycles in the Ptolemaic system were much larger than had previously 
      been suspected. </p>
      <p>As for the Tychonic model of Geocentrism, if one uses the same 
      elliptical orbits of Kepler, the result is that two epicycles in the 
      Ptolemaic system will translate into one ellipse, per planet, in the 
      Tychonic system. Thus, around the sun, Mercury and Venus would each have a 
      perigee and an apogee, and each locus of points along that polarity would 
      show the respective phases of Mercury and Venus, as viewed from earth. </p>
      <p>Thank you for your submission. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I presumed that Robert was defending a pure Geocentric system, in which all 
  planets orbited a stationary Earth as proposed by Aristotle and Ptolemy. 
  However my presumption was incorrect. As he states above, he is defending a 
  system in which all planets but the Earth do orbit the Sun. Tycho Brahe 
  proposed such a system. Here are links to pages that demonstrate the various 
  systems.</p>
  <ul>

    (Geocentric), Brahe (Geocentric), and Copernicus (Heliocentric) <b>
    <a href="http://jove.geol.niu.edu/faculty/stoddard/JAVA/ptolemy.html">CLICK 
    HERE.</a></b></li>
  </ul>
  <p><u><b><font size="4">Conduct <i>another</i> &quot;experiment&quot;</font></b></u></p>
  <p>Again, at the following web site, run the simulation:<br>
  <b><a href="http://www.astroarts.com/simulation/cometary-orbit.php">
  http://www.astroarts.com/simulation/cometary-orbit.php</a></b></p>
  <p>1. Enter 55P in the &quot;Object Name&quot; box.<br>
  2. Press &quot;Search&quot; button.<br>
  3. Press &quot;Show Orbit&quot; button.<br>
  <img border="1" src="dropdown.gif" align="right" hspace="16" width="222" 
  height="277">4. Run the simulation as before, but in the &quot;Center&quot; drop down 
  menu, select &quot;Earth&quot; rather that &quot;Sun&quot;. Note that the Earth appears to remain 
  stationary, and the Sun and all the other planets <i>appear</i> to revolve 
  around the Earth.</p>
  <p>Note you can toggle the &quot;Center&quot; menu to any planet, and you do not change 
  any of the mechanics of the simulation, you only change the presentation of 
  the graphic, and artificially center everything on the selected planet. This 
  is basically a matter of perception. You can center everything on the Earth, 
  or Mars, or Jupiter for that matter, and the whole universe is presented as 
  revolving around the selected center, but <i>nothing else changes</i> (in 
  particular, no epicycles are needed to introduce retrograde motion).</p>
  <p>So I think this simulation shows rather effectively, whether the Earth is 
  in the center, or the Sun is at the center, can be purely a matter of 
  perception, and not physics. So it is quite possible for one person to 
  perceive the Earth as orbiting the Sun, and someone else to perceive the whole 
  universe as orbiting the Earth, and yet, hard as it may be to believe, both 
  can be quite &quot;right&quot; at the same time, and neither can &quot;prove&quot; the other 
  wrong, because everything else is absolutely identical for both of them.</p>
  <p>Before you say that's just plain crazy, how does the Heliocentrist 
  Christian explain this? -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Josh 10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people 
    had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book 
    of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to 
    go down about a whole day.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Heliocentrist Christian, who believes that the Earth spins on its axis 
  once in 24 hours while at the same time orbiting the Sun, generally has no 
  problem accepting this verse as absolutely true. The answer is easy. The Earth 
  just stopped spinning on its axis for 24 hours, and in that way the Sun stood 
  still for a whole day. How? Simple. God willed it, and it just happened. After 
  all, nothing is impossible with God, right? Well thank you very much. If God 
  could maintain the status quo, while at the same time stopping the Earth on 
  its axis, is it just <i>possible</i> that THAT is really the norm, and it was
  <i>really</i> the universe that stopped its motion around the earth? Well, can 
  you prove it didn't?</p>
  <hr>
  <p>CAI on their <a href="http://www.catholicintl.com/">index page</a> 
  advertises my discussion with Robert Sungenis as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Responding to our $1,000 Geocentric Challenge, enthusiast Michael 
    Scheifler entered with full guns blazing to kill off the Geocentric 
    prevaricators. To his utter shock, using charts and graphs he had marshaled 
    from NASA and other sites, Michael discovered just the opposite of his 
    original contention. In the end, he confessed that he had no way to make a 
    case against Geocentrism. Click above to see the &quot;confession.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To set things straight, I set out to show that the prevailing geocentric 
  view in the 15th century, accepted by the Catholic Church, that all the 
  planets orbited the earth in perfect circles (Aristotle / Ptolemy), was rather 
  easily consigned to the rubbish heap by something as simple as observing the 
  phases of Venus through a telescope. But, as evident in the above discussion, 
  Robert does not defend the pure geocentric systems of Aristotle and Ptolemy, 
  but rather the modified system of Tyco Brahe, which in the strictest sense is 
  anything <i>but</i> what the Catholic Church historically accepted as true. 
  The Tychonic system concedes that the Earth rotates on its axis in 24 hours, 
  and that all the planets but Earth orbit the Sun, without Ptolemaic epicycles. 
  It is really all but conceding heliocentrism, turning it upside-down in a 
  manner of speaking, by artificially setting the otherwise overwhelmingly 
  heliocentric system in a last gasp minimalist geocentric context.</p>
  <p>So my &quot;original contention&quot; stands, I have not been &quot;shocked&quot;, nor have I 
  taken an &quot;opposite&quot; view. I quite firmly believe that the heliocentric system 
  IS reality, and that this does NOT contradict the Bible in any way. But at the 
  same time, and from the very beginning, I fully recognized that if Robert so 
  chooses, there is <i>nothing</i> that can persuade him that his Geocentric 
  perception is wrong. If he so desires, he will <u>always</u> be able to adapt 
  his view to include any contrary &quot;proof&quot;, or explain it away to his 
  satisfaction, and still maintain that his Earth-centered system &quot;works&quot;. But 
  at the same time, his facade of irrefutability, and strictly literal 
  interpretation of the Bible on this topic, in no way insure that his 
  geocentric view is reality. </p>
