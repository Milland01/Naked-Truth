<center><font size="6">An Appeal to Catholics</font></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="5"><strong>A</strong></font>s the six thousand years of sin,
    conflict, and woe in this old world are about to be forever ended by the
    second coming of Jesus Christ, the prophet John declares a voice from heaven
    will call out in divine tones to the millions of this earth who are a part
    of the great Roman Catholic system, &quot;Come out of her, My people.&quot;<sup>
    1</sup><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon this Scriptural statement we would make two
    observations: First, God recognizes the fact that within the fold of the
    Roman Church are many true-hearted souls who eventually will be a part of
    the multitudes redeemed from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. He
    calls them &quot;My people.&quot; Second, before the culmination of earthly
    history large numbers of the sincere Christians now following the Pontiff of
    Rome will make a mighty exodus from Roman Catholicism, and a repetition of
    the miracle of Pentecost will be experienced.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the factors that, some nearing day, will cause
    this exodus from the Roman Church?</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>WHY CATHOLICS WILL &quot;COME OUT&quot;</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many thousands of Catholics will come to realize that
    the spirit of the Papacy is not in conformity with the spirit of Jesus
    Christ. The Master said, &quot;If any man hear My words, and believe not, I
    judge him not.&quot;<sup> 2</sup> Into the life of Jesus upon earth there
    never entered the spirit of intolerance and compulsion that is
    characteristic of the Papacy. He invited all to follow Him, to take His
    yoke, to become His disciples; but when He was refused and repulsed, He
    turned away, not with anathemas upon those who dissented from Him, but with
    tears in His eyes and a heart filled with compassion for those who rejected
    Him. As the days go by, the intolerant spirit of the Roman Church will stand
    out in clearer and more unfavorable contrast to the gospel of Christ, which
    is based upon freedom of choice and noncompulsion in the things of religion.
    Many now within the Roman fold will sense this disparity, and will choose to
    follow Christ rather than a pope who places under interdict and damnation
    those who will not follow him. The tenderness, the winsomeness, and the love
    of the Master will win where papal intolerance and force will lose out.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, multitudes will soon come to an appreciation
    of the beautiful simplicity of the religion of Jesus Christ in contrast to
    the pomp of Catholicism. Christ asked for no episcopal throne canopied with
    crimson velvet and royal purple. Sitting among the lowly on the mountain
    side, He said, &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit: for their's is the
    kingdom of heaven;&quot; &quot;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit
    the earth.&quot;<sup> 3</sup> He aborted every tendency of His followers to
    raise Him to lordship or kingly position, declaring, &quot;I am among you as
    he that serveth.&quot; <sup>4</sup> He charged His disciples, &quot;The
    kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; ... but ye shall not be
    so.&quot; <sup>5</sup> This humble and unassuming attitude on the part of
    Christ will be seen to be the antithesis of that of the Pope, the cardinals,
    and all those who rule the Papacy.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>FORMALISM CAN NOT SATISFY</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roman Catholicism is an endless round of forms and
    ceremonies, of the doing of penances and the gaining of indulgences; of the
    worship of the saints and relics; of the repetitive saying of prayers and
    the thumbing of beads and rosaries; of the observance of scores of holy days
    and festivals. In the trying times to come, these will not bring soul
    satisfaction to many, and they will seek the simple worship of God and the
    living heart service of the Master who died for them. It is ever the
    temptation of religious systems to drift into formalism, but formalism can
    not long satisfy the desire of the human heart for simple and direct access
    to God. Jesus said, &quot;The hour cometh, and now is, when the true
    worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father
    seeketh such to worship Him.&quot; <sup>6</sup> And these will heed the
    call, &quot;Come out of her, My people.&quot; Again, the time is approaching
    when many of those now Catholics will no longer acknowledge &quot;the
    primacy of Peter&quot; and &quot;the vicegerency of the Pope.&quot; The
    claim that Christ ordained Peter and his successors to rule the church will
    be seen to be fallacious, and the claim that the Pope takes the place of God
    Almighty on earth will be seen to be baseless. The eternal verity of Paul's
    declaration, &quot;Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
    is Jesus Christ,&quot; <sup>7</sup> will be acknowledged. It will be seen
    that the church is &quot;built upon the foundation of the apostles and
    prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone,&quot;<sup> 8</sup>
    rather than upon the erring and human Peter, who, instead of presumptuously
    claiming the chief position in the church, as those who say they are his
    successors have claimed, declared that there is laid &quot;in Zion a chief
    corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall not be
    confounded.&quot;<sup> 9</sup> Truehearted Christians within the Roman
    Church will some day sense the fact that the Pope and the hierarchy are but
    human beings prone to error and sin like the rest of us, and they will feel
    the need of a divine sovereign, a divine head to the church, even Jesus
    Christ Himself, &quot;the author and finisher of our faith.&quot; In that
    day they will also see the insufficiency and the inefficacy of a mediatory
    system of priests, saints, and the virgin Mary, and they will cry out after
    the &quot;one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.&quot;<sup>10</sup>
    They will lay hold upon Jesus, not through a penumbra of human and priestly
    interposition, but as &quot;a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of
    the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minister of the sanctuary, and
    of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.&quot; <sup>11</sup></p>
    <p align="center"><strong>THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF THE SCRIPTURES</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, they will come to appreciate the fact
    that the Bible is the supreme authority for the Christian in all matters
    pertaining to doctrine, faith, and practice. It will be realized that the
    Scriptures contain a revelation of God's will sufficient for human needs
    without &quot;tradition&quot; being added thereto and, in many cases,
    superseding the Bible. It will be remembered that Christ rejected all the
    tradition and human interpretation of His day, and appealed directly and
    solely to the Scriptures as the norm in religion. All who take His name will
    do likewise. The Bible will stand forth in all its glory as the supreme
    guide for the Christian, and when those who are now Catholics, aided by the
    Spirit of God, delve into its pages unspoiled by the interpolations of the
    Church, the errors to which they now unwittingly subscribe will no longer
    hold them, and they will step out into the fullness of primitive and
    unadulterated Christianity. They will see that the Bible is naught but a
    revelation of a Person, and that Person is Jesus Christ, the Saviour and
    Redeemer of men, who alone can grant forgiveness to the sinner and peace and
    assurance to troubled hearts.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world to-day is in the closing hours of a great
    controversy between Christ and Satan, between truth and error, which has
    raged in the universe for millenniums. In this conflict there is no neutral
    zone and no noncombatants. Every man, woman, and child must soon make a
    decision whether he will follow the God of hosts to eternal life and
    everlasting salvation or human devisings and traditions to certain
    destruction. The dilemma presented is the commandments and will of God on
    the one side, and, on the other, the commandments and doctrines of men.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>WE MUST HASTEN</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In such a crisis, we must not long delay our decision.
    We must hasten the preparation of our souls for the manifestation of the Son
    of God in the clouds of heaven. We must make sure the perfection of a
    Christlike character that will meet every test of the judgment day. We must
    make certain that we are on the side of truth, for only truth shall abide in
    the day when God shall cleanse the world by fire prior to creating new
    heavens and a new earth wherein righteousness shall dwell.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To-day is none too early, dear reader, be you Catholic or
    Protestant, to take an inventory of your relation to Jesus Christ and to
    conform in every particular to truth as revealed to men in His word, for the
    day is near when &quot;every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day
    shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall
    try every man's work of what sort it is.&quot; <sup>12</sup></p>
