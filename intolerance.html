America?</font></b></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The appearance of Governor George W. Bush at Bob Jones University has
    generated an unprecedented storm of controversy and criticism of a Christian
    Institution, and that has to raise some serious and disturbing questions in
    the minds of all those who cherish religious freedom. If a political
    candidate gave a speech at a Jewish institution, would he be expected to
    condemn all the teachings of Judaism that he disagreed with or found
    politically incorrect? If the same politician appeared to speak at a Muslim
    college, would he be expected to condemn the Islamic religion for their
    beliefs that are not considered politically correct? What religious
    institution would ever invite a politician if a condemnation of their
    theology or general beliefs and practices was expected as the norm? So why
    is it that a fundamentalist Protestant Bible-believing Christian University
    comes under such condemnation and scrutiny by politicians and the press
    because of their religious beliefs? Why is Protestantism any less acceptable
    than any other religion in the American forum?</p>
    <p>Protestantism was founded some 400 years ago upon the belief that Roman
    Catholicism had fallen away from biblical teaching into apostasy, and this
    prompted the reformers to ultimately break away from it and form various
    denominations.&nbsp; <i>All</i> of the reformers from that era were
    absolutely convinced that the Catholic Church was the harlot church of
    Revelation, and the papacy was the antichrist power that the Bible
    prophesied. Large numbers of Protestants were persecuted and even burned at
    the stake for their anti-Catholic beliefs, yet to be a Protestant today
    makes one a socially unacceptable bigot? Indeed the United States was
    largely populated by Christians seeking refuge from the Catholic persecution
    they had experienced in Europe. The fear of the revival of similar state
    sponsored persecution is what prompted the first amendment to the
    Constitution, which reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Amendment I</b></p>
      <p><b>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
      or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
      speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,
      and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>But now, U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli from New Jersey initiated a
    resolution to censure Bob Jones University <i>for its distinctly Protestant
    religious beliefs</i>:</p>

  <p>Can you believe it? In a land founded largely by Protestants on the
  principle of religious freedom, the government is now being asked to condemn a
  Protestant University for its long held and historical religious beliefs? <i>That
  is precisely the kind of governmental religious intolerance that the first
  amendment is intended to prevent!</i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Our land is in jeopardy. The time is drawing on when its
    legislators shall so abjure the principles of Protestantism as to give
    countenance to Romish apostasy. The people for whom God has so marvelously
    wrought, strengthening them to throw off the galling yoke of popery, will by
    a national act give vigor to the corrupt faith of Rome, and thus arouse the
    tyranny which only waits for a touch to start again into cruelty and
    despotism. With rapid steps are we already approaching this period. When
    Protestant churches shall seek the support of the secular power, thus
    following the example of that apostate church, for opposing which their
    ancestors endured the fiercest persecution, then will there be a national
    apostasy which will end only in national ruin.&quot;</p>
    <p>Source: <i>Spirit of Prophecy</i>, Volume 4, by Ellen G. White, published
    in 1884, page 410.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If religious freedom is to survive in this country, then the government of
  the United States has no business condemning the religious beliefs of any
  denomination or religious institution. When governmental thought police think
  they can impose their standards of political correctness on any religion, and
  get away with it, then the inevitable result will be persecution, and the
  death of our long cherished religious freedom. Note the following statements
  from an interfaith organization:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <hr>
    <p align="left">&quot;On behalf of concerned people of faith, I urge members
    of the United States Senate to denounce any association of bigotry,
    discrimination, and intolerance with religious faith. When a university, or
    any institution, in our society ties prejudice to spirituality, people of
    conscience must protest. For Bob Jones University to foment bigotry in the
    name of Christianity is the height of hypocrisy if not heresy.&quot; -&nbsp;
