<CENTER><B>ON THE BLUE LAWS</B></CENTER>

<DIV ALIGN=right>February 1, 1977</DIV>

<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The repeal of the Sunday Closing or Blue Laws
portends a negative impact on the quality of life in Massachusetts. We,
therefore, urge the preservation of these ancient but valuable restrictions
to protect a common day of rest.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proponents of repeal argue that an end to the
Blue Laws will have substantial economic benefits, including an increase
in sales, profits, employment,&nbsp; payrolls, consumer convenience, revenues,&nbsp;
the state's competitive advantage in relation to its neighbors, plus a
reduction in prices.&nbsp; These extensive claims invite skepticism,&nbsp;
In fact, all of these claims have been strongly refuted by opponents of
repeal, some of whom maintain that exactly the opposite effects will occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, the claim of increased sales is offset by the alternative
position that only a certain number of dollars for retail purposes exists
and they will be expanded over seven rather than six days. Moreover, the
alleged competitive advantage for Massachusetts will not materialize, it
is argued, because shoppers travel to border states not merely to take
advantage of Sunday openings but to save money on sales taxes.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>The issue of economic benefits is immensely
complex and strongly debated.&nbsp; It deserves&nbsp; lengthy and careful
study, not exaggerated advocacy on either side.</U>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, proponents of repeal argue that the option
of opening or remaining closed will be preserved.&nbsp; Cities or towns
can choose to maintain Sunday and holiday closings; commercial establishments
can choose not to open; and laborers will be free to work or not to work.
It&nbsp; seems&nbsp; more&nbsp; likely, however, that&nbsp; the practical
dynamics of competition will force openings. When one city permits openings,
others will follow suit, to maintain competitive parity. Businesses will
do likewise, and workers, receiving income incentives and&nbsp; fearing
reprisals, will feel compelled to work.&nbsp; The likely result will be
generalized commercial openings, making the seventh day nearly indistinguishable
from the other six in terms of consumer and commercial activity.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever conclusions are ultimately reached
about the economic gains or losses from the Sunday closing laws, <U>some
fundamental human values could be lost if these laws are repealed</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Society needs a regular period of rest, relaxation, and renewal, a shift
in pace from our pervasive consumerism and commercialism. A <U>common</U>
day of rest makes it more likely that families and friends can experience
this relaxation and renewal together.&nbsp; The present exceptions in the
law mean that many citizens must work on Sunday I but the repeal of the
closing laws probably would magnify that factor many-fold, making a qualitative
change out of a quantitative one.&nbsp; <U>Sunday closing laws are a device
to protect the quality of human life in a complex, intense, and almost
constantly gyrating society</U>.&nbsp; The rest from labor, the relief
from the clamor of perpetual motion, is such a fundamental human need as
to be a sacred duty.&nbsp; To brand these laws as archaic is to pretend
that these needs are outmoded.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>The original religious rationale for the
Blue Laws is unfair in a pluralistic society</U>.&nbsp; The sanctity of
Sabbath worship, of course, is one of our commitments, but it cannot be
one, in the midst of cultural diversity, for which we seek the sanctions
of civil law.&nbsp; Though the present common day of rest obviously coincides
with the primary day of worship in the churches, it is unclear that Sunday
openings will have any more adverse effects on participation in Sunday
worship than recreational&nbsp; opportunities now have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
intent, therefore, in supporting the principle of these laws is not to
protect the Christian Sabbath, but to preserve the benefits for human well-being
in a uniform time for rest and renewal. Until such occasion, if ever, as
changes in cultural patterns and traditions allow for another day, it seems
reasonable that the time of common rest should be Sunday.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The very complexity of our society, of course,
requires some exceptions to Sunday closings. An examination of the laws
might reveal, in fact, the need for further amendments to insure that exceptions
are rational rather than random.&nbsp; All such exceptions, we hope, will
be based upon necessity and equitability, to maintain the day of rest as
a time to benefit, not hurt, people.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>We believe that the Sunday closing laws
deserve continuation</U>.&nbsp; We recognize that the effects of these
statutes are complex and ambivalent. We, however, urge citizens and legislators
to consider not only the alleged economic benefits of repeal, which may,
in fact, be mythical or minimal, but also the quality of life in this Commonwealth.
