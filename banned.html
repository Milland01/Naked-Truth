  <p><strong>ITEM #1&nbsp;&nbsp; POPE INNOCENT III</strong></p>
  <p>Pope Innocent III stated in 1199:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... to be reproved are those who translate into French the Gospels, the 
    letters of Paul, the psalter, etc. They are moved by a certain love of 
    Scripture in order to explain them clandestinely and to preach them to one 
    another. The mysteries of the faith are not to explained rashly to anyone. 
    Usually in fact, they cannot be understood by everyone but only by those who 
    are qualified to understand them with informed intelligence. The depth of 
    the divine Scriptures is such that not only the illiterate and uninitiated 
    have difficulty understanding them, but also the educated and the gifted (Denzinger-Schönmetzer,
    <i>Enchiridion Symbolorum</i> 770-771)</p>

  <p>ITEM #2&nbsp;&nbsp; COUNCIL OF TOULOUSE - 1229 A.D.</strong></p>
  <p>The Council of Toulouse, which met in November of 1229, about the time of 
  the crusade against the Albigensians, set up a special ecclesiastical 
  tribunal, or court, known as the Inquisition (Lat. inquisitio, an inquiry), to 
  search out and try heretics. Twenty of the forty-five articles decreed by the 
  Council dealt with heretics and heresy. It ruled in part:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Canon 1. We appoint, therefore, that the archbishops and bishops shall 
    swear in one priest, and two or three laymen of good report, or more if they 
    think fit, in every parish, both in and out of cities, who shall diligently, 
    faithfully, and frequently seek out the heretics in those parishes, by 
    searching all houses and subterranean chambers which lie under suspicion. 
    And looking out for appendages or outbuildings, in the roofs themselves, or 
    any other kind of hiding places, all which we direct to be destroyed.</p>
    <p>Canon 6. Directs that the house in which any heretic shall be found shall 
    be destroyed.</p>
    <p>Canon 14. We prohibit also that the laity should be permitted to have the 
    books of the Old or New Testament; unless anyone from motive of devotion 
    should wish to have the Psalter or the Breviary for divine offices or the 
    hours of the blessed Virgin; but we most strictly forbid their having any 
    translation of these books.</p>

    according to the dictates of duty (de ipsis faciant quod debebant). A decree 
    of the Council of Toulouse (1229) makes it appear probable that in France

  <p><strong>ITEM #4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHN WYCLIFFE - MORNING STAR OF THE 
  REFORMATION</strong></p>
  <p>John Wycliffe was the very first to translate the entire Bible into 
  English, which he completed in 1382. Wycliffe translated from the Latin 
  Vulgate. One copy of an original manuscript is in the Bodlein Library in 
  Oxford, England. Wycliffe's Bibles were painstakingly reproduced by hand by 
  copyists.</p>
  <p>In 1408 the third synod of Oxford, England, banned unauthorized English 
  translations of the Bible and decreed that possession of English translation's 
  had to be approved by diocesan authorities. The Oxford council declared:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is dangerous, as St. Jerome declares, to translate the 
    text of Holy Scriptures out of one idiom into another, since it is not easy 
    in translations to preserve exactly the same meaning in all things. We 
    therefore command and ordain that henceforth no one translate the text of 
    Holy Scripture into English or any other language as a book, booklet, or 
    tract, of this kind lately made in the time of the said John Wyclif or 
    since, or that hereafter may be made, either in part or wholly, either 
    publicly or privately, under pain of excommunication, until such translation 
    shall have been approved and allowed by the Provincial Council. He who shall 
    act otherwise let him be punished as an abettor of heresy and error.&quot;</p>

  Louis, August 9, 1894, &quot;The Word of God&quot;, The English Bible Before the

  <p>At the ecumenical Council of Constance, in 1415, Wycliffe was posthumously 
  condemned by Arundel, the archbishop of Canterbury, as &quot;that pestilent wretch 
  of damnable heresy who invented a new translation of the scriptures in his 
  mother tongue.&quot; By the decree of the Council, more that 40 years after his 
  death, Wycliffe's bones were exhumed and publicly burned and the ashes were 
  thrown into the Swift river.</p>
  <p>Around 1454 Gutenberg printed an edition of the Latin Vulgate Bible on the 
  first moveable-type printing press. With this new printing technology books 
  could now be printed faster and cheaper than ever before, a fact that 
  Protestants soon took advantage of. Within a hundred years there was a virtual 
  explosion of Protestant Bibles coming off the new presses.</p>
  <hr width="50%" align="center" size="2">
  <p><strong>ITEM #5&nbsp;&nbsp; THE BIBLE IN ENGLISH IS PRINTED</strong></p>
  <p>William Tyndale completed a translation of the New Testament from the Greek 
  in 1525, which church authorities in England tried their best to confiscate 
  and burn. After issuing a revised edition in 1535, he was arrested, spent over 
  a year in jail, and was then strangled and burned at the stake near Brussels 
  in October 6th, 1536. It is estimated today that some 90 percent of the New 
  Testament in the 1611 King James Bible is the work of Tyndale. Tyndale was 
  unable to complete his translation of the Old Testament before his death.</p>
  <p>Miles Coverdale, an assistant to Tyndale, completed Tyndale's translation 
  of the Old Testament using Martin Luther's German text and Latin as sources, 
  and in Germany he printed the first complete Bible in English on October 4, 
  1535.</p>
  <p>Matthew's Bible, a composite of the work of Tyndale and Coverdale, probably 
  edited by John Rogers, was published in 1537 under the pseudonym &quot;Thomas 
  Matthew&quot;, and was the second complete edition of the Bible printed in 
  English.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Coverdale's &quot;Great Bible&quot;, called that because of its size, was published 
  in 1539 and had over 21,000 copies printed in seven editions in only a single 
  year. Working under the patronage of Thomas Cromwell, Coverdale had submitted 
  his Bible via the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, and it was 
  published with the authorization of King Henry VIII, whose likely motivation 
  was the realization that the Bible was an effective means of combating 
  papists. Amazingly, at the end of the book of Malachi were the initials W.T., 
  covering half a page, standing for William Tyndale! Beginning with the second 
  edition, the Great Bible included a preface by Thomas Cranmer, and so it is 
  also called Cranmer's Bible.</p>
  <p>The English parliament in 1543 passed a law forbidding the use of any 
  English translations other than the &quot;Great Bible&quot;. Tyndale's New Testament was 
  specifically prohibited, and later Wycliffe's and Coverdale's Bibles were also 
  banned. It was decreed a crime for any unlicensed person to read or explain 
  the Scriptures in public. Many copies of Tyndale's New Testament and 
  Coverdale's Bible were burned in London, though ironically, the authorized 
  &quot;Great Bible&quot; contained the work of both men!</p>
  <p>In 1557 the Geneva Bible was first published, which continued to be popular 
  even years after the King James was available. The Geneva Bible was the 
  version in use during Shakespeare's time, and was often quoted by him in his 
  plays.</p>
  <p>In 1559 Queen Elizabeth, a Protestant, decreed that a copy of the Bishop's 
  Bible be placed in every parish church. The Bishop's Bible was printed in 20 
  editions over 42 years and was the basis for the King James Bible.</p>
  <p>Responding to the increasing flood of Protestant Bibles in English, the 
  very first complete Bible in English to be produced by the Catholic Church was 
  the Douay Rheims, a translation from the Latin Vulgate, which was finally 
  completed in the early 17th century. The New Testament was begun in 1578 and 
  finished in Rheims France in 1582, and the Old Testament was finished in 
  1609-10 in Douay. Note that it had been over <em>two centuries</em> since 
  Wycliffe had completed his English Bible! </p>
  <p>In an attempt to combat the swiftly rising tide of Protestantism, the 
  Catholic Church began maintaining lists of the prohibited books which were to 
  be confiscated. Here is an example from England:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Memorandum of a proclamation made at Paul's Cross on the first Sunday in 
    Advent, 1531, against the buying, selling or reading of the following books:</p>

  <p><strong>ITEM #6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE BIBLE PROHIBITED BY THE <i>INDEX 
  LIBRORUM PROHIBITORUM</i></strong></p>
  <p>Pope Pius IV had a list of the forbidden books compiled and officially 
  prohibited them in the Index of Trent (<em>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</em>) 
  of 1559. This is an excerpt:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rule I</p>
    <p>All books which were condemned prior to 1515 by popes or ecumenical 
    councils, and are not listed in this Index, are to stand condemned in the 
    original fashion.</p>
    <p>Rule II</p>
    <p>Books of arch-heretics - those who after 1515 have invented or incited 
    heresy or who have been or still are heads and leaders of heretics, such as 
    Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Hubmaier, Schwenckfeld, and the like  whatever 
    their name, title or argumentation  are prohibited without exception. As 
    far as other heretics are concerned, only those books are condemned without 
    exception which deal <em>ex professo</em> with religion. Others will be 
    permitted after Catholic theologians have examined and approved them by the 
    order of bishops and inquisitors. Likewise, Catholic books written by those 
    who subsequently fell into heresy or by those who after their lapse returned 
    into the bosom of the Church can be permitted after approval by a 
    theological faculty or the inquisition.</p>
    <p>Rule III</p>
    <p>Translations of older works, including the church fathers, made by 
    condemned authors, are permitted if they contain nothing against sound 
    doctrine. However, translations of books of the Old Testament may be allowed 
    by the judgment of bishops for the use of learned and pious men only. These 
    translations are to elucidate the Vulgate so that Sacred Scripture can be 
    understood, but they are not to be considered as a sacred text. Translations 
    of the New Testament made by authors of the first sections in this Index are 
    not to be used at all, since too little usefulness and too much danger 
    attends such reading.</p>
    <p>Rule IV</p>
    <p>Since experience teaches that, if the reading of the Holy Bible in the 
    vernacular is permitted generally without discrimination, more damage than 
    advantage will result because of the boldness of men, the judgment of 
    bishops and inquisitors is to serve as guide in this regard. Bishops and 
    inquisitors may, in accord with the counsel of the local priest and 
    confessor, allow Catholic translations of the Bible to be read by those of 
    whom they realize that such reading will not lead to the detriment but to 
    the increase of faith and piety. The permission is to be given in writing. 
    Whoever reads or has such a translation in his possession without this 
    permission cannot be absolved from his sins until he has turned in these 
    Bibles ...</p>
    <p>Rule VI</p>
    <p>Books in the vernacular dealing with the controversies between Catholics 
    and the heretics of our time are not to be generally permitted, but are to 
    be handled in the same way as Bible translations. ...</p>

  <p><strong>ITEM #7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; POPE CLEMENT XI ON READING SCRIPTURE</strong></p>

  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/C11UNIGE.HTM">UNIGENITUS</a></strong>, 
  The Dogmatic Constitution issued by Pope Clement XI on Sept. 8, 1713:</p>
  <p>The following statements are condemned as being error:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>79. It is useful and necessary at all times, in all places, and for every 
    kind of person, to study and to know the spirit, the piety, and the 
    mysteries of Sacred Scripture.<br>
    80. The reading of Sacred Scripture is for all.<br>
    81. The sacred obscurity of the Word of God is no reason for the laity to 
    dispense themselves from reading it.<br>
    82. The Lord's Day ought to be sanctified by Christians with readings of 
    pious works and above all of the Holy Scriptures. It is harmful for a 
    Christian to wish to withdraw from this reading.<br>
    83. It is an illusion to persuade oneself that knowledge of the mysteries of 
    religion should not be communicated to women by the reading of Sacred 
    Scriptures. Not from the simplicity of women, but from the proud knowledge 
    of men has arisen the abuse of the Scriptures and have heresies been born.<br>
    84. To snatch away from the hands of Christians the New Testament, or to 
    hold it closed against them by taking away from them the means of 
    understanding it, is to close for them the mouth of Christ.<br>
    85. To forbid Christians to read Sacred Scripture, especially the Gospels, 
    is to forbid the use of light to the sons of light, and to cause them to 
    suffer a kind of excommunication.</p>

  <p><strong>ITEM #9 POPE LEO XII CONDEMNS VERNACULAR BIBLES AS HARMFUL</strong></p>
  <p>From the Encyclical <strong><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L12UBIPR.HTM">UBI PRIMUM</a>
  </strong>of POPE LEO XII, MAY 5, 1824:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>17. You have noticed a society, commonly called the Bible society, boldly 
    spreading throughout the whole world. Rejecting the traditions of the holy 
    Fathers and infringing the well-known decree of the Council of Trent,[16] it 
    works by every means to have the holy Bible translated, or rather 
    mistranslated, into the ordinary languages of every nation. There are good 
    reasons for fear that (as has already happened in some of their commentaries 
    and in other respects by a distorted interpretation of Christ's gospel) they 
    will produce a gospel of men, or what is worse, a gospel of the devil![17]</p>
    <p>18. To prevent this evil, Our predecessors published many constitutions. 
    Most recently Pius VII wrote two briefs, one to Ignatius, Archbishop of 
    Gniezno, the other to Stanislaus, Archbishop of Mohileu, quoting carefully 
    and wisely many passages from the sacred writings and from the tradition to 
    show how harmful to faith and morals this wretched undertaking is.</p>
    <p>19. In virtue of Our apostolic office, We too exhort you to try every 
    means of keeping your flock from those deadly pastures. Do everything 
    possible to see that the faithful observe strictly the rules of our 
    Congregation of the Index. Convince them that to allow holy Bibles in the 
    ordinary language, wholesale and without distinction, would on account of 
    human rashness cause more harm than good.</p>

  <strong><a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P8TRADIT.HTM">TRADITI 
  HUMILITATI</a> </strong>of Pope Pius VIII, May 24, 1829</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>5. We must also be wary of those who publish the Bible with new 
    interpretations contrary to the Church's laws. They skillfully distort the 
    meaning by their own interpretation. They print the Bibles in the vernacular 
    and, absorbing an incredible expense, offer them free even to the 
    uneducated. Furthermore, the Bibles are rarely without perverse little 
    inserts to insure that the reader imbibes their lethal poison instead of the 
    saving water of salvation. Long ago the Apostolic See warned about this 
    serious hazard to the faith and drew up a list of the authors of these 
    pernicious notions. The rules of this Index were published by the Council of 
    Trent;[8] the ordinance required that translations of the Bible into the 
    vernacular not be permitted without the approval of the Apostolic See and 
    further required that they be published with commentaries from the Fathers. 
    The sacred Synod of Trent had decreed[9] in order to restrain impudent 
    characters, that no one, relying on his own prudence in matters of faith and 
    of conduct which concerns Christian doctrine, might twist the sacred 
    Scriptures to his own opinion, or to an opinion contrary to that of the 
    Church or the popes. Though such machinations against the Catholic faith had 
    been assailed long ago by these canonical proscriptions, Our recent 
    predecessors made a special effort to check these spreading evils.[10] With 
    these arms may you too strive to fight the battles of the Lord which 
    endanger the sacred teachings, lest this deadly virus spread in your flock.</p>

  <p>ITEM #11&nbsp;&nbsp; POPE GREGORY XVI CONDEMNS BIBLE SOCIETIES, VERNACULAR 
  BIBLES</strong></p>
  <p>From the encyclical <strong><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"></strong>
  <strong><a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/G16INTER.HTM">INTER 
  PRAECIPUAS</a> (On Biblical Societies) </strong>by Pope Gregory XVI, May 8, 
  1844:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. Among the special schemes with which non-Catholics plot against the 
    adherents of Catholic truth to turn their minds away from the faith, the 
    biblical societies are prominent. They were first established in England and 
    have spread far and wide so that We now see them as an army on the march, 
    conspiring to publish in great numbers copies of the books of divine 
    Scripture. These are translated into all kinds of vernacular languages for 
    dissemination without discrimination among both Christians and infidels. 
    Then the biblical societies invite everyone to read them unguided. Therefore 
    it is just as Jerome complained in his day: they make the art of 
    understanding the Scriptures without a teacher&quot; common to babbling old women 
    and crazy old men and verbose sophists,&quot; and to anyone who can read, no 
    matter what his status. Indeed, what is even more absurd and almost unheard 
    of, they do not exclude the common people of the infidels from sharing this 
    kind of a knowledge.</p>
    <p>4. Moreover, regarding the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, 
    even many centuries ago bishops in various places have at times had to 
    exercise greater vigilance when they became aware that such translations 
    were being read in secret gatherings or were being distributed by heretics. 
    Innocent III issued warnings concerning the secret gatherings of laymen and 
    women, under the pretext of piety, for the reading of Scripture in the 
    diocese of Metz.[12] There was also a special prohibition of Scripture 
    translations promulgated either in Gaul a little later[13] or in Spain 
    before the sixteenth century.[14]</p>
    <p>[Footnote #13: Council of Toulouse (1229), can. 14., as listed at the 
    beginning of this article]</p>
    <p>11. ... We again condemn all the above-mentioned biblical societies of 
    which our predecessors disapproved. ... Besides We confirm and renew by Our 
    apostolic authority the prescriptions listed and published long ago 
    concerning the publication, dissemination, reading, and possession of 
    vernacular translations of sacred Scriptures.</p>
    <p>12. ... In particular, watch more carefully over those who are assigned 
    to give public readings of holy scripture, so that they function diligently 
    in their office within the comprehension of the audience; under no pretext 
    whatsoever should they dare to explain and interpret the divine writings 
    contrary to the tradition of the Fathers or the interpretation of the 
    Catholic Church.</p>

    pluribus</a>, </em></strong>Nov. 9, 1846, (See #13-14):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>13. You already know well, venerable brothers, the other portentous 
      errors and deceits by which the sons of this world try most bitterly to 
      attack the Catholic religion and the divine authority of the Church and 
      its laws. They would even trample underfoot the rights both of the sacred 
      and of the civil power. For this is the goal of the lawless activities 
      against this Roman See in which Christ placed the impregnable foundation 
      of His Church. This is the goal of those secret sects who have come forth 
      from the darkness to destroy and desolate both the sacred and the civil 
      commonwealth. These have been condemned with repeated anathema in the 
      Apostolic letters of the Roman Pontiffs who preceded Us[15] We now confirm 
      these with the fullness of Our Apostolic power and command that they be 
      most carefully observed. </p>
      <p>14. This is the goal too of the crafty Bible Societies which renew the 
      old skill of the heretics and ceaselessly force on people of all kinds, 
      even the uneducated, gifts of the Bible. They issue these in large numbers 
      and at great cost, in vernacular translations, which infringe the holy 
      rules of the Church. The commentaries which are included often contain 
      perverse explanations; so, having rejected divine tradition, the doctrine 
      of the Fathers and the authority of the Catholic Church, they all 
      interpret the words of the Lord by their own private judgment, thereby 
      perverting their meaning. As a result, they fall into the greatest errors. 
      Gregory XVI of happy memory, Our superior predecessor, followed the lead 
      of his own predecessors in rejecting these societies in his apostolic 
      letters.[16] It is Our will to condemn them likewise.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>14. The crafty enemies of the Church and human society attempt to 
      seduce the people in many ways. One of their chief methods is the misuse 
      of the new technique of book-production. They are wholly absorbed in the 
      ceaseless daily publication and proliferation of impious pamphlets, 
      newspapers and leaflets which are full of lies, calumnies and seduction. 
      Furthermore, under the protection of the Bible Societies which have long 
      since been condemned by this Holy See,[7] they distribute to the faithful 
      under the pretext of religion, the holy bible in vernacular translations. 
      Since these infringe the Church's rules,[8] they are consequently 
      subverted and most daringly twisted to yield a vile meaning. So you 
      realize very well what vigilant and careful efforts you must make to 
      inspire in your faithful people an utter horror of reading these 
      pestilential books. Remind them explicitly with regard to divine scripture 
      that no man, relying on his own wisdom, is able to claim the privilege of 
      rashly twisting the scriptures to his own meaning in opposition to the 
      meaning which holy mother Church holds and has held. It was the Church 
      alone that Christ commissioned to guard the deposit of the faith and to 
      decide the true meaning and interpretation of the divine 
      pronouncements.[9]</p>

    <p>14. ... Wherefore it must be recognized that the sacred writings are 
    wrapt in a certain religious obscurity, and that no one can enter into their 
    interior without a guide[32]; God so disposing, as the Holy Fathers commonly 
    teach, in order that men may investigate them with greater ardor and 
    earnestness, and that what is attained with difficulty may sink more deeply 
    into the mind and heart; and, most of all, that they may understand that God 
    has delivered the Holy Scriptures to the Church, and that in reading and 
    making use of His Word, they must follow the Church as their guide and their 
    teacher. ... the Council of the Vatican, which, in renewing the decree of 
    Trent declares its &quot;mind&quot; to be thisthat &quot;in things of faith and morals, 
    belonging to the building up of Christian doctrine, that is to be considered 
    the true sense of Holy Scripture which has been held and is held by our Holy 
    Mother the Church, whose place it is to judge of the true sense and 
    interpretation of the Scriptures; and therefore that it is permitted to no 
    one to interpret Holy Scripture against such sense or also against the 
    unanimous agreement of the Fathers.&quot;[34] ... Hence it follows that all 
    interpretation is foolish and false which either makes the sacred writers 
    disagree one with another, or is opposed to the doctrine of the Church.</p>
    <p>15. ... But it is most unbecoming to pass by, in ignorance or contempt, 
    the excellent work which Catholics have left in abundance, and to have 
    recourse to the works of non-Catholicsand to seek in them, to the detriment 
    of sound doctrine and often to the peril of faith, the explanation of 
    passages on which Catholics long ago have successfully employed their talent 
    and their labor. For although the studies of non-Catholics, used with 
    prudence, may sometimes be of use to the Catholic student, he should, 
    nevertheless, bear well in mindas the Fathers also teach in numerous 
    passages[41]that the sense of Holy Scripture can nowhere be found incorrupt 
    out side of the Church, and cannot be expected to be found in writers who, 
    being without the true faith, only gnaw the bark of the Sacred Scripture, 
    and never attain its pith.</p>

    Holy Scripture, as well as those of the Eastern Church, if published by 
    non-Catholics, even though apparently edited in a faithful and complete

  <blockquote>
    <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not an historical fact that the church forbade the 
    reading of the Bible in the vernacular?</i></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is and it is not. The Church never issued a general 
    prohibition that made the reading of the Bible in the vernacular unlawful; 
    but at various time she laid down certain conditions regarding the matter, 
    which had to be observed by the faithful, so that they might not <i>wrest 
    the Scriptures to their own destruction. </i>It was not until the Albigenses, 
    the Wyclifites, and later on the Protestants, issued editions of the Bible 
    that bristled with mistranslations, and the most arbitrary changes of the 
    original text, that the Church made stringent regulations in regard to the 
    reading of the Scriptures. These regulations did not make Bible reading 
    unlawful, but required that only approved editions, well supplied with 
    explanatory notes taken from the writings of the Early Fathers, should be 
    used. In this matter, as in so many others, Protestants failed to 
    distinguish between the actions of the Church and the actions of the 
    Provincial Synods. It is indeed true that the Synod of Toulouse, in 1229, 
    the Synod of Tarragona, 1233, and the Synod of Oxford, in 1408, issued 
    formal prohibitions against the reading of the Bible by the laity, but these 
    prohibitions had only a local application, and were revoked as soon as the 
    danger that threatened the faith in these localities had passed. The 
    Church's legislation in the matter of Bible reading was never prohibitive, 
    but only tended to the enactment of such restrictions as the common good 
    evidently required.</p>

    the action of the Church in hindering the printing and circulation of Holy 
    Writ in the vernacular. Fundamentally however, this ac- [p. x] cusation is 
    based on calumny. During the first twelve centuries Christians were highly 
    familiar with the text of Holy Scripture, as is evident from the homilies of 
    the Fathers and the sermons of the mediaeval preachers; nor did the 
    ecclesiastical authorities ever intervene to prevent this. It was only in 
    consequence of heretical abuses, introduced particularly by the Waldenses, 
    the Albigenses, the followers of Wyclif, and by Protestants broadly speaking 
    (who with sacrilegious mutilations of Scripture and arbitrary 
    interpretations vainly sought to justify themselves in the eyes of the 
    people; twisting the text of the Bible to support erroneous doctrines 
    condemned by the whole history of the Church) that the Pontiffs and the

    of the people are the believers always in private interpretation  a fallacy 
    both absurd in itself and pregnant with disastrous consequences. These

  <p>The current <em>Code of Canon Law</em>, which went into effect in 1983, 
  reads as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Can. 825 § 1. Books of the Sacred Scriptures cannot be published unless 
    they have been approved either by the Apostolic See or by the conference of 
    bishops; for their vernacular translations to be published it is required 
    that they likewise be approved by the same authority and also annotated with 
    necessary and sufficient explanations.</p>
    <p>§ 2. With the permission of the conference of bishops Catholic members of 
    the Christian faithful can collaborate with separated brothers and sisters 
    in preparing and publishing translations of the Sacred Scriptures annotated 
    with appropriate explanations.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is by no means a complete list, but it is what I have for the moment. 
  Far from championing the spread of the Bible, and the translation into the 
  vernacular, the Catholic Church has a history of repression and censorship in 
  this regard. It was really the combination of the reformation and the advent 
  of the printing press that &quot;let the cat out of the bag.&quot; It seems that Bibles 
  could be printed faster than they (and their authors or owners) could be 
  burned. Since Catholicism could no longer contain the Bible and keep it out of 
  the hands of the laity, the issue has become one of authority to interpret.</p>
  <p>For those Catholics who continue to maintain that the Roman Catholic Church 
  was justified in seizing and burning &quot;faulty&quot; vernacular Bibles, and that 
  grave errors in translation were the primary reason for destroying them, I 
  offer the following challenge:</p>
  <p>Tyndale's Bible has recently been republished by David Daniell and Yale 
  University Press and can still be found at some bookstores. Tyndale's New 
  Testament is 0-300-04419-4 for the hardback and 0-300-06580-9 for the 
  paperback. Tyndale's Old Testament in hardback is ISBN 0-300-05211-1. Mr. 
  Daniell has updated the spelling but remained faithful to the original text.</p>
  <p>The Geneva Bible's 1602 New Testament has also been reprinted in facsimile 
  by Pilgrim Classic Commentaries in 1989 from an original in the Cambridge 
  University Library. The ISBN is 0-8298-0789-6 for the hardback and ISBN 
  0-8298-0785-3 for the paperback.</p>
  <p>The 1611 Authorized Version (King James) Bible has also been reprinted 
  word-for-word with original spelling by Thomas Nelson Publishers in 1993.</p>
  <p>In addition, to my knowledge, the Roman Catholic Church was unsuccessful in 
  completely destroying all copies of any &quot;heretical&quot; reformation era vernacular 
  translations of the Bible. Despite their diligence, there are surviving copies 
  existing today that can be studied. I therefore challenge Catholics to produce 
  Catholic documents from the reformation period that cite and explain in detail 
  the grave &quot;errors&quot; in vernacular Protestant Bibles, that warranted not only 
  their destruction, but also frequently the death of the author, as well as 
  those found in possession of said Bibles. It would seem that any charge of 
  grave translation &quot;errors&quot; can still be verified by almost anyone today from 
  either original editions or facsimile reprints. So mere claims of faulty 
  vernacular Bibles proves <em>absolutely nothing</em> without providing 
  citations of the exact verse and Bible edition where the alleged error occurs.</p>
  <p>I maintain that the objections of the Catholic church to the various 
  attempts to produce a Bible in the vernacular, were not that of faulty 
  translations (although that claim was made), but rather that of &quot;unauthorized 
  heretical&quot; interpretations that resulted from widespread publication and the 
  laity finally being able to read the entire Bible for themselves in their own 
  tongue, as noted in the various items above. The laity was then able to 
  discern the truth for themselves, and the biblical truth was often at odds 
  with Catholic teaching. Dissent flourished with the availability of the Bible, 
  and so persecution of these heretics increased as well, in an attempt by the 
  church to maintain control and assert her presumed authority. It is a sad 
  chapter in history that is quite well documented.</p>
