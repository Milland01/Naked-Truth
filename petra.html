  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<br>
    Mat 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of
    the living God.<br>
    Mat 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
    Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father
    which is in heaven.<br>
    Mat 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock
    I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This passage is most frequently quoted by Catholics to support Petrine
  theory (papal succession), that proposes Jesus founded His church on Peter
  (the rock). The Protestant will usually point out that two different words for
  &quot;rock&quot; are present in the Greek text- &quot;thou art Peter (<em>Petros</em>),
  and upon this rock (<em>petra</em>) I will build my church;&quot; ... . The
  distinction that is apparently being made in the Greek is one of size. Petros
  equates to a pebble, or small stone, while petra equates to a massive
  foundation stone, too large to be moved:</p>
  <p>From Strong's Greek dictionary:</p>
  <p>4074. Petros, pet'-ros; appar. a prim. word; a (piece of) rock (larger than
  G3037); as a name, Petrus, an apostle:--Peter, rock. Comp. G2786.</p>
  <p>4073. petra, pet'-ra; fem. of the same as G4074; a (mass of) rock (lit. or
  fig.):--rock.</p>
  <p>2786. Kephas, kay-fas'; of Chad. or. [comp. H3710]; the Rock; Cephas (i.e.
  Kepha), a surname of Peter:--Cephas.</p>
  <p>3710. keph, kafe; from H3721; a hollow rock:--rock.</p>
  <p>This distinction in the Greek, the Protestant points out, makes it clear
  that Peter is <em>not </em>the rock that the church is founded upon, but
  rather Peter's profession of faith and/or Jesus Himself. To this the Catholic
  will likely respond that early church fathers indicate the book of Matthew was
  originally written in Aramaic, not Greek. The Greek, they will say, has been
  incorrectly rendered because petra, being feminine in the Greek, could not
  have been used to represent Peter's name. They will propose that what Jesus
  really said in Aramaic to Simon Peter was this: &quot;thou art Peter (<em>Kepha</em>),
  and upon this rock (<em>kepha</em>) I will build my church;&quot; ... . The
  original Aramaic, they will point out, makes it quite plain that Peter was
  indeed the rock. An example of this kind of logic can be found at <nobr><strong>

  </strong></nobr>at Catholic Answers. However, there
  is a small problem with this approach. No Aramaic texts of Matthew have
  survived, they have all been <em>lost</em>. So just what the Aramaic texts
  might have said is nothing but pure <em>speculation</em>. So speculation is
  all they can muster as evidence to support Petrine theory in Matthew 16:18.</p>
  <p>Some Catholics may even suggest that there has <em>always</em> been a
  unanimous Church interpretation of this passage in support Petrine theory, at
  least up until relatively recent Protestant dissent to the presumed authority
  of the papacy. The following is presented to show that even early
  &quot;Christian fathers&quot; were actually quite diverse in their
  interpretation of this passage in Matthew and they most certainly did not
  agree that Peter was the foundation rock <em>(petra)</em> which Jesus spoke
  about.</p>
  <p>The first item is purported by some to be a speech given by Bishop
  Strossmayer of Diakovár to the First Vatican Council (1870) in opposition to
  the declaration of papal infallibility as dogma. It should be noted that there
  is strong evidence for it being a forgery, but the points raised within the
  text are worthy of consideration, even though the document itself was
  apparently disclaimed by Bishop Strossmayer. (See Patrick Madrid's book <i>Pope
  Fiction,</i> page 259. It also interesting to note, that the best possible
  evidence the Catholic Church could provided on this matter, is the text of the
  genuine speech (or speeches) given by Bishop Strossmayer to Vatican I, in
  opposition to papal infallibility. To my knowledge this has not happened, and
  one has to wonder why.</p>

    <p align="left"><big><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V</big></big>enerable Fathers
    and Brethren:—It is not without trembling, yet with a conscience free and
    tranquil before God who lives and sees me, that I open my mouth in the midst
    of you in this august assembly. From the time that I have been sitting here
    with you I have followed with attention the speeches that have been made in
    the hall, hoping with great desire that a ray of light descending from on
    high might enlighten the eyes of my understanding, and permit me to vote the
    canons of this Holy Ecumenical Council with perfect knowledge of the case.</p>
    <p align="center">[STUDY OF OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS]</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penetrated with the feeling of
    responsibility, of which God will demand of me an account, I have set myself
    to study with the most serious attention the Old and New Testaments, and I
    have asked these venerable monuments of truth to make known to me if the
    holy pontiff, who presides here, is truly the successor of St. Peter, vicar
    of Jesus Christ, and the infallible doctor of the church. To resolve this
    grave question I have been obliged to ignore the present state of things,
    and to transport myself in mind, with the evan-</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 4]</p>
    <p align="left">gelical torch in my hand, to the days when there was neither
    Ultramontanism nor Gallicanism, and in which the church had for doctors St.
    Paul, St. Peter, St. James, and St. John—doctors to whom no one can deny
    the divine authority without putting in doubt that which the holy Bible,
    which is here before me, teaches us, and which the Council of Trent has
    proclaimed as the rule of faith and of morals. I have then opened these
    sacred pages. Well (shall I dare to say it?), I have found nothing either
    near nor far which sanctions the opinion of the Ultramontanes. And still
    more, to my very great surprise, I find in the apostolic days no question of
    a pope, successor to St. Peter, and vicar of Jesus Christ, any more than of
    Mahomet who did not then exist. You, Monsignor Manning, will say that I
    blaspheme; you, Monsignor Fie, that I am mad. No, Monsignori, I do not
    blaspheme, and I am not mad. Now having read the whole New Testament, I
    declare before God, with my hand raised to that great crucifix, that I have
    found no trace of the papacy as it exists at this moment. Do not refuse me
    your attention, my venerable brethren, and with your murmuring and
    interruptions do not justify those who say, like Father Hyacinthe, that this
    Council is nothing, but that our votes have been from the beginning dictated
    by authority. If such were the case, this august assembly, on which the eyes
    of the whole world are turned, would fall into the most shameful discredit.
    If we wish to make it great, we must be free. I thank his Excellency,
    Monsignor Dupanloup, for the sign of approbation which he makes with his
    head: this gives me courage, and I go on.</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 5]</p>
    <p align="center">[JESUS GAVE NO MASTERY TO PETER]</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading then the sacred books with that
    attention with which the Lord has made me capable, I do not find one single
    chapter, or one little verse, in which Jesus Christ gives to St. Peter the
    mastery over the apostles, his fellow-workers. If Simon, son of Jonas, had
    been what we believe his holiness Pius IX, to be today, it is wonderful that
    He had not said to him, 'When I have ascended to my Father, you should all
    obey Simon Peter as you obey Me. I establish him my vicar upon earth.'</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is Christ silent on this point,
    but so little does He think of giving a head to the church, that when He
    promises to His apostles to judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28),
    He promises them twelve thrones, one for each, without saying that among
    those thrones one shall be higher than the others—which shall belong to
    Peter. Certainly, if He had wished that is should be so, He would have said
    it. What do we conclude from this sentence? Logic tells us that Christ did
    not wish to make St. Peter the head of the apostolic college. When Christ
    sent the apostles to conquer the world, to all He gave the promise of the
    Holy Spirit. Permit me to repeat it: if He had wished to constitute Peter
    His vicar, He would have given him the chief command over His spiritual
    army. Christ—so says the Holy Scripture—forbade Peter and his colleagues
    to reign or to exercise lordship, or to have authority over the faithful
    like the kings of the Gentiles (St. Luke 22:25). If St. Peter had been
    elected pope, Jesus would not have spoken thus; but according to our
    tradition, the papacy holds in its hands two swords, symbols of spiritual
    and temporal power.</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 6]</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing has surprised me very much.
    Turning it over in my mind, I said to myself, If Peter had been elected
    Pope, would his colleagues have been permitted to send him with St. John to
    Samaria to announce the gospel of the Son of God? What do you think,
    venerable brethren, if at this moment we permitted ourselves to send his
    holiness Pius IX. and his Excellency Mons. Plantier to go to the Patriarch
    of Constantinople, to pledge him to put an end to the Eastern schism?</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here is another still more important
    fact. An Ecumenical Council is assembled at Jerusalem to decide on the
    questions which divide the faithful. Who would have called together this
    Council if St. Peter had been pope? St. Peter. Well, nothing of this
    occurred. The apostle assisted at the Council as all the others did, yet it
    was not he who summed up, but St. James; and when the decrees were
    promulgated, it was in the name of the apostles, the elders, and the
    brethren (Acts 15). Is it thus what we do in our church? The more I examine,
    O venerable brethren, the more I am convinced that in the scriptures the son
    of Jonas does not appear to be first.</p>
    <p align="center">[PAUL AND APOSTLES SILENT ON PAPACY]</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, while we teach that the church is
    built upon St. Peter, St. Paul (whose authority cannot be doubted) says, in
    his epistle to the Ephesians 2:20, it is built on the foundation of the
    apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone.
    And the same apostle believes so little in the supremacy of St. Peter, that
    he openly blames those who would say, We are of Paul, We are of Apollos (I
    Cor. 1:12), as those</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 7]</p>
    <p align="left">who say, We are of Peter. If therefore this last apostle had
    been the vicar of Christ, St. Paul would have taken great care not to
    censure so violently those who belonged to his own colleagues. The same
    apostle, counting up the offices of the church, mentions apostles, prophets,
    evangelists, doctors, and pastors. Is it to be believed, my venerable
    brethren, that St. Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, would have
    forgotten the first of these offices, the papacy, if the papacy had been of
    divine institution? The forgetfulness appeared to me to be as impossible as
    if an historian of this Council were not to mention one word of his holiness
    Pius IX. [Several voices— 'Silence, heretic, silence!] Calm yourselves, my
    brethren, I have not yet finished. Forbidding me to go on, you show
    yourselves to the world to do wrong in shutting the mouth of the smallest
    member of this assembly.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I continue. The apostle Paul makes no
    mention, in any of his letters directed to the various churches, of the
    primacy of Peter. If this primacy had existed, if, in one word, the church
    had in its body a supreme head infallible in teaching, would the great
    apostle of the Gentiles have forgotten to mention it? What do I say? He
    would have written a long letter on this all-important subject. Then, as he
    has actually done, when the edifice of the Christian doctrine is erected,
    would the foundation, the key of the arch, be forgotten? Now, unless you
    hold that the church of the apostles was heretical (which none of us would
    either desire or dare to say), we are obliged to confess that the church has
    never been more beautiful, more pure, or more holy, than in the days when
    there was no pope.</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 8]</p>
    <p align="left">[Cries of, 'It is not true; it is not true.'] Let not
    Monsignor di Laval say, 'No.' since if any of you, my venerable brethren,
    should dare to think that the church which has today a pope for its head is
    more in the faith, more pure in its morals than the <em>Apostolic church</em>,
    let him say it openly in the face of the universe, for this enclosure is the
    center from which our words fly from pole to pole.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go on. Neither in the writings of St.
    Paul, St. John, nor St. James, have I found a trace or germ of the papal
    power. St. Luke, the historian of the missionary labors of the apostles, is
    silent on this all-important point. The silence of these holy men, whose
    writings make part of the canon of the divinely-inspired Scriptures, has
    appeared to me burdensome and impossible, if Peter had been pope, and as
    unjustifiable as if Thiers, writing the history of Napoleon Bonaparte, had
    omitted the title of emperor.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see here before me a member of the
    assembly, who says, pointing at me with his finger, 'There is a schismatic
    bishop who has got among us under false colors.' No, no, my venerable
    brethren, I have not entered this august assembly as a thief, by the window,
    but by the door like yourselves. My title of bishop gave me a right to it,
    as my Christian conscience forces me to speak and to say that which I
    believe to be true.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has surprised me most, and what
    moreover is capable of demonstration, is the silence of St. Peter. If the
    apostle had been what we proclaim him to be—that is, the vicar of Jesus
    Christ on earth—he surely would have known it; if he had known it, how is
    it that not once did he act as pope? He might have</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 9]</p>
    <p align="left">done it on the day of Pentecost, when he pronounced his
    first sermon, but did not do it; neither in the two letters directed to the
    church. Can you imagine such a pope, my venerable brethren, if St. Peter had
    been pope? Now, if you wish to maintain that he was the pope, the natural
    consequence arises that you must maintain that he was ignorant of the fact.
    Now I ask whoever has a head to think and a mind to reflect, are these two
    suppositions possible?</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To return, I say, while the apostle
    lived, the church never thought that there could be a pope; to maintain the
    contrary, all the sacred writings must be entirely ignored.</p>
    <p align="center">[PETER AT ROME A &quot;RIDICULOUS LEGEND&quot;]</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is said on all sides, Was not St.
    Peter at Rome? Was he not crucified with his head down? Are not the pulpits
    in which he taught, the altars at which he said the mass, in this eternal
    city? St. Peter having been at Rome, my venerable brethren, rests only on
    tradition; but, if he had been Bishop of Rome, how can you from that
    episcopate prove his supremacy? Scaliger, one of the most learned of men,
    has not hesitated to say that St. Peter's episcopate and residence at Rome
    ought to be classed with ridiculous legends. [Repeated cries, 'Shut his
    mouth, shut his mouth; make him come down from the pulpit.']</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Venerable brethren, I am ready to be
    silent; but is it not better, in an assembly like ours, to prove all things,
    as the apostle commands, and to hold fast what is good? We have a dictator,
    before whom we—even his holiness Pius IX. himself—must prostrate
    ourselves, and be silent and bow our heads. That dictator is history. This
    is not like a legend, which can be</p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 10]</p>
    <p align="left">made as the potter makes his clay, but is like a diamond
    which cuts on the glass what cannot be canceled. Till now I have only leant
    on her; and if I have found no trace of the papacy in the apostolic days,
    the fault is hers, not mine. Do you wish to put me into the position of one
    accused of falsehood? You may do it, if you can.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear from the right some one expressing
    these words—'Thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my church.' I
    will answer this objection presently, my venerable brethren; but, before
    doing so, I wish to present you with the results of my historical
    researches.</p>
    <p align="center">[NO POPE IN FIRST FOUR CENTURIES]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding no trace of the papacy in the days of the
    apostles, I said to myself, I shall find what I am in search of in the
    annals of the church. Well, I say it frankly—I have sought for a pope in
    the first four centuries, and I have not found him. None of you, I hope,
    will doubt the great authority of the holy Bishop of Hippo, the great and
    blessed St. Augustine. This pious doctor—the honor and glory of the
    Catholic church, was secretary in the Council of Melvie. In the decrees of
    this venerable assembly are to be found these significant words—'Whoever
    wills to appeal to those beyond the sea shall not be received by any one in
    Africa to the communion.' The bishops of Africa acknowledged the bishop of
    Rome so little that they smote with excommunication those who would have
    recourse to an appeal. These same bishops, in the sixth Council of Carthage,
    held under Aurelius, Bishop of that city, wrote Celestinus, Bishop of Rome,
    to warn him not to receive appeals from the bishops, priests, or clerics of
    Africa; and that he should send no</p>
    <p>[pg. 11]</p>
    <p>more legates or commissaries; and that he should not introduce human
    pride into the church.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the Patriarch of Rome had from the earliest times
    tried to draw to himself all the authority is an evident fact; but it is an
    equally evident fact that he had not the supremacy which the Ultramontanes
    attribute to him. Had he possessed it, would the bishops of Africa—St.
    Augustine first among them—have dared to prohibit the appeals of their
    decrees to his supreme tribunal? I confess without difficulty that the
    Patriarch of Rome held the first place. One of Justinian's laws says, 'Let
    us order, after the definition of the four Councils, that the holy pope of
    ancient Rome shall be the first of the bishops, and that the most high
    Archbishop of Constantinople, which is the new Rome, shall be the second.'
    'Bow down then to the supremacy of the pope,' you will say to me. Do not run
    so fast to this conclusion, my venerable brethren, inasmuch as the law of
    Justinian has written on the face of it, 'Of the order of the patriarchal
    sees.' Precedence is one thing, the power of jurisdiction is another. For
    example, supposing that in Florence there was an assembly of all the bishops
    of the kingdom, the precedence would be given to the Primate of Florence, as
    among the Easterns it would be accorded to the Patriarch of Constantinople,
    as in England to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But neither the first, nor
    the second, nor the third, could deduce from the position assigned to him a
    jurisdiction over his colleagues.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The importance of the bishops of Rome proceeded not
    from a divine power, but from the importance of the city in which they had
    their seat. Monsignor</p>
    <p>[pg. 12]</p>
    <p>Darboy (in Paris) is not superior in dignity to the Archbishop of Avignon;
    but, in spite of that, Paris gives him a consideration which he would not
    have, if, instead of having his palace on the bank of the Seine, he had it
    on that of the Rhone. That which is true in the religious order is the same
    in civil and political matters: the Prefect of Rome is not more a prefect
    than one at Pisa; but civilly and politically he has a greater importance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have said that from the very first centuries the
    Patriarch of Rome aspired to the universal government of the church.
    Unfortunately he very nearly reached it; but he had not succeeded assuredly
    in his pretensions, for the Emperor Theodosius II made a law by which he
    established that the Patriarch of Constantinople should have the same
    authority as he of Rome (<em>Leg.cod. de sacr., etc.</em>). The fathers of
    the Council of Chalcedon put the bishops of the new and the old Rome in the
    same order on all things, even ecclesiastical (<em>Can</em>. 28). The sixth
    Council of Carthage forbade all the bishops to take the title of prince of
    the bishops, or sovereign bishop. As for this title of universal bishop,
    which the popes took later, St. Gregory I, believing that his successors
    would never think of adorning themselves with it, wrote these remarkable
    words, 'None of my predecessors has consented to take this profane name; for
    when a patriarch gives himself the name of <em>Universal</em>, the title of
    patriarch suffers discredit. Far be it then from Christians to desire to
    give themselves a title which brings discredit upon their brethren!'</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words of St. Gregory are directed to his collea-</p>
    <p>[pg. 13]</p>
    <p>gues of Constantinople, who pretended to the primacy of the church. Pope
    Pelagius II calls John, Bishop of Constantinople, who aspired to the high
    priesthood, 'impious and profane.' 'Do not care,' he said, 'for the title of
    universal, which John has usurped illegally. Let none of the patriarchs take
    this profane name; for what misfortunes may we not expect, if among the
    priests such elements arise? They would get what has been foretold for
    them—He is the king of the sons of pride' (<em>Pelagius</em> II, <em>Lett.</em>
    13). Do not these authorities prove (and I might add a hundred more of equal
    value), with a clearness as the sun at midday, that the first bishops of
    Rome were not till much later recognized as universal bishops and heads of
    the church? And on the other hand, who does not know that from the year 325,
    in which the first Council of Nice was held, down to 580, the year of the
    second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, among more than 1,109 bishops
    who assisted at the first six general Councils, there were not more than
    nineteen Western bishops? Who does not know that the Councils were convoked
    by the Emperors without informing, and sometimes against the wish of, the
    bishop of Rome?—that Hosius, Bishop of Cordova, presided at the first
    Council of Nice, and edited the canons of it? The same Hosius presided
    afterwards at the Council of Sardica, excluding the legates of Julius,
    Bishop of Rome.</p>
    <p align="center">[&quot;THOU ART PETER&quot;]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say no more, my venerable brethren; and I come now
    to speak of the great argument—which you mentioned before—to establish
    the primacy of the bishop of Rome by the rock (<em>petra</em>). If this were
    true, the dispute would be at an end; but our forefathers—and</p>
    <p>[pg. 14]</p>
    <p>they certainly knew something—did not think of it as we do. St. Cyril
    in his fourth book on the Trinity, says, 'I believe that by the rock you
    must understand the unshaken faith of the apostles.' St. Hilary, Bishop of
    Poitiers, in his second book on the Trinity, says, 'The rock (petra) is the
    blessed and only rock of the faith confessed by the mouth of St. Peter;' and
    in the sixth book of the Trinity, he says, 'It is on this rock of the
    confession of faith that the church is built.' 'God,' says St. Jerome in the
    sixth book on St. Matthew, 'has founded His church on this rock, and it is
    from this rock that the apostle Peter has been named.' After him St.
    Chrysostom says in his fifty-third homily on St. Matthew, 'On this rock I
    will build my church—that is, on the faith of the confession.' Now, what
    was the confession of the apostle? Here it is—'Thou art the Christ, the
    Son of the living God.' Ambrose<strong>,</strong> the holy Archbishop of
    Milan (on the second chapter of the Ephesians), St. Basil<strong> </strong>of
    Seleucia, and the fathers of the Council of Chalcedon<strong>,</strong>
    teach exactly the same thing. Of all the doctors of Christian antiquity St.
    Augustine occupies one of the first places for knowledge and holiness.
    Listen then to what he writes in his second treatise on the first epistle of
    St. John: 'What do the words mean, I will build my church on the rock? <em>On
    this faith</em>, on that which said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
    living God.' In his treatise on St. John we find this most significant
    phrase—'On this rock which thou hast confessed I will build my church,
    since Christ was the rock.' The great bishop believed so little that the
    church was built on St. Peter that he said to the people in his thirteenth</p>
    <p>[pg. 15]</p>
    <p>sermon, 'Thou art Peter, and on this rock (<em>petra</em>) which thou
    hast confessed, on this rock which thou hast known, saying, Thou art Christ,
    the Son of the living God, I will build my church—upon Myself, who am the
    Son of the living God: I will build it on Me, and not Me on thee.' That
    which St. Augustine thought upon this celebrated passage was the opinion of
    all Christendom in his time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, to resume, I establish:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) That Jesus has given to His apostles the same
    power that He gave to St. Peter.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) That the apostles never recognized in St. Peter the
    vicar of Jesus Christ and the infallible doctor of the church.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) That St. Peter never thought of being pope, and never
    acted as if he were pope.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) That the Councils of the first four centuries, while
    they recognized the high position which the Bishop of Rome occupied in the
    church on account of Rome, only accorded to him a pre-eminence of honor,
    never of power or of jurisdiction.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) That the holy fathers in the famous passage, 'Thou
    art Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,' never understood that
    the church was built on Peter (<em>super Petrum</em>) but on the rock (<em>super
    petram</em>), that is, on the confession of the faith of the apostle. I
    conclude victoriously, with history, with reason, with logic, with good
    sense, and with a Christian conscience, that Jesus Christ did not confer any
    supremacy on St. Peter and that the bishops of Rome did not become
    sovereigns of the church, but only by confiscating one by one all the rights
    of the episcopate. [Voices—'Silence, impudent Protestant! Silence!']</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I am not an impudent Protestant. History is</p>
    <p>[pg. 16]</p>
    <p>neither Catholic, nor Anglican, nor Calvinistic, nor Lutheran, nor
    Arminian, nor schismatic Greek nor Ultramontane. She is what she is—that
    is, something stronger than all confessions of faith of the Canons of the
    Ecumenical Councils. Write against it, if you dare! but you cannot destroy
    it, any more than taking a brick out of the Coliseum would make it fall. If
    I have said anything which history proves to be false, show it to me by
    history, and without a moment's hesitation I will make an honorable apology;
    but be patient, and you will see that I have not said all that I would or
    could; and even were the funeral pile waiting for me in the place of St.
    Peter's, I should not be silent, and I am obliged to go on. Monsignor
    Dupanloup, in his celebrated <em>Observations</em> on this Council of the
    Vatican, has said, and with reason, that if we declared Pius IX infallible,
    we must necessarily, and from natural logic, be obliged to hold that all his
    predecessors were also infallible.</p>
    <p align="center">[PAPAL ERRORS AND CONTRADICTIONS]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, venerable brethren, here history raises its
    voice to assure us that some popes have erred. You may protest against it or
    deny it, as you please, but I will prove it. Pope Victor (192) first
    approved of Montanism, and then condemned it. Marcellinus (296-303) was an
    idolater. He entered into the temple of Vesta, and offered incense to the
    goddess. You will say that it was an act of weakness; but I answer, a vicar
    of Jesus Christ dies rather than become an apostate. Liberius (358)
    consented to the condemnation of Athanasius, and made a profession of
    Arianism, that he might be recalled from his exile and reinstated in his
    see. Honorius (625) adhered to Monothelitism:</p>
    <p>[pg. 17]</p>
    <p>Father Gratry has proved it to demonstration. Gregory I (590-604) calls
    any one Antichrist who takes the name of Universal Bishop, and contrariwise
    Boniface III, (607,8) made the parricide Emperor Phocas confer that title
    upon him. Paschal II (1099-1118) and Eugenius III (1145-53) authorized
    dueling; Julius II (1509) and Pius IV (1560) forbade it. Eugenius IV
    (1431-39) approved of the Council of Basle and the restitution of the
    chalice to the church of Bohemia; Pius II (1458) revoked the concession.
    Hadrian II (867-872) declared civil marriages to be valid; Pius VII
    (1800-23) condemned them. Sixtus V (1585-90) published an edition of the
    Bible, and by a bull recommended it to be read; Pius VII condemned the
    reading of it. Clement XIV (1769-74) abolished the order of the Jesuits,
    permitted by Paul III, and Pius VII reestablished it.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why look for such remote proofs? Has not our holy
    Father here present, in his bull which gave the rules for this Council, in
    the event of his dying while it was sitting, revoked all that in past times
    may be contrary to it, even when that proceeds, from the decisions of his
    predecessors? And certainly, if Pius IX has spoken <em>ex cathedra</em>, it
    is not when, from the depths of his sepulcher, he imposes his will on the
    sovereigns of the church. I should never finish, my venerable brethren, if I
    were to put before your eyes the contradictions of the popes in their
    teaching. If then you proclaim the infallibility of the actual pope, you
    must either prove, that which is impossible—that the popes never
    contradicted each other—or else you must declare that the Holy Spirit has
    revealed to you</p>
    <p>[pg. 18]</p>
    <p>that the infallibility of the papacy only dates from 1870. Are you bold
    enough to do this?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the people may be indifferent, and pass by
    theological questions which they do not understand, and of which they do not
    see the importance; but though they are indifferent to principles, they are
    not so to facts. Do not then deceive yourselves. If you decree the dogma of
    papal infallibility, the Protestants, our adversaries, will mount in the
    breach, the more bold that they have history on their side, whilst we have
    only our own denial against them. What can we say to them when they show up
    all the bishops of Rome from the days of Luke to his holiness Pius IX? Ah!
    if they had all been like Pius IX, we should triumph on the whole line; but
    alas! it is not so. [Cries of 'Silence, silence; enough, enough!']</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not cry out, Monsignori! To fear history is to own
    yourselves conquered; and, moreover, if you made the whole waters of the
    Tiber pass over it, you would not cancel a single page. Let me speak, and I
    will be as short as it is possible on this most important subject.—Pope
    Vigilius (538) purchased the papacy from Belisarius, lieutenant of the
    Emperor Justinian. It is true that he broke his promise and never paid for
    it. Is this a canonical mode of binding on the tiara? The second Council of
    Chalcedon had formally condemned it. In one of its canons you read that 'the
    bishop who obtains his episcopate by money shall lose it and be degraded.'
    Pope Eugenius III (IV. in original) (1145) imitated Vigilius. St. Bernard,
    the bright star of his age, reproves the pope, saying to him, 'Can you show
    me in this great city of Rome any one who would re-</p>
    <p>[pg. 19]</p>
    <p>ceive you as pope if they had not received gold or silver for it?'</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My venerable brethren, will a pope who establishes a
    bank at the gates of the temple be inspired by the Holy Spirit? Will he have
    any right to teach the church infallibly? You know the history of Formosus
    too well for me to add to it. Stephen XI caused his body to be exhumed,
    dressed in his pontifical robes; he made the fingers which he used for
    giving the benediction to be cut off, and then had him thrown into the
    Tiber, declaring him to be a perjurer and illegitimate. He was then
    imprisoned by the people, poisoned, and strangled. Look how matters were
    re-adjusted; Romanus, successor of Stephen, and, after him, John X,
    rehabilitated the memory of Formosus.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you will tell me these are fables, not history.
    Fables! Go, Monsignori, to the Vatican Library and read Platina, the
    historian of the papacy, and the annals of Baronius (A.D. 897). These are
    facts which, for the honor of the Holy See, we should wish to ignore; but
    when it is to define a dogma which may provoke a great schism in our midst,
    the love which we bear to our venerable mother church, Catholic, Apostolic,
    and Roman, ought it to impose silence on us?</p>
    <p align="center">[PAPAL SINS AND EXCESSES]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go on. The learned Cardinal Baronius, speaking of
    the papal court, says (give attention, my venerable brethren, to these
    words), 'What did the Roman church appear in those days? How infamous! Only
    all-powerful courtesans governing in Rome! It was they who gave, exchanged,
    and took bishoprics; and horrible to relate, they got their lovers, the
    false popes, put</p>
    <p>[pg. 20]</p>
    <p>on the throne of St. Peter' (Baronius, A.D. 912). <em>You</em> will
    answer, These were false popes, not true ones: let it be so; but in that
    case, if for fifty years the see of Rome was occupied by anti-popes, how
    will you pick up again the thread of pontifical succession? Has the church
    been able, at least for a century and a half, to go on without a head, and
    find itself acephalous?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look now: The greatest number of these anti-popes
    appear in a genealogical tree of the papacy; and it must have been this
    absurdity that Baronius described; because Genebrardo, the great flatterer
    of the popes, had dared to say in his Chronicles (A.D. 901), &quot;This
    century is unfortunate, as for nearly 150 years the popes have fallen from
    all the virtues of their predecessors, and have become <em>apostates</em>
    rather than <em>apostles</em>.' I can understand how the illustrious
    Baronius must have blushed when he narrated the acts of these Roman bishops.
    Speaking of John XI (931), natural son of Pope Sergius and of Marozia, he
    wrote these words in his annals—'The holy church, that is, the Roman, has
    been vilely trampled on by such a monster.' John XII (956) elected pope at
    the age of eighteen, through the influence of courtesans, was not one whit
    better than his predecessor.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I grieve, my venerable brethren, to stir up so much
    filth. I am silent on Alexander VI, father and lover of Lucretia; I turn
    away from John XXII (1319), who denied the immortality of the soul, and was
    deposed by the holy Ecumenical Council of Constance. Some will maintain that
    this Council was only a private one; let it be so; but if you refuse any
    authority to it, as a logical sequence you must hold the nomination</p>
    <p>[pg. 21]</p>
    <p>of Martin V (1417) to be illegal. What, then, will become of the papal
    succession? Can you find the thread of it?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not speak of the schisms which have dishonored
    the church. In those unfortunate days the See of Rome was occupied by two
    competitors, and sometimes even by three. Which of these was the true pope?
    Resuming once more, again I say, if you decree the infallibility of the
    present bishop of Rome, you must establish the infallibility of all the
    preceding ones, without excluding any. But can you do that, when history is
    there establishing with a clearness equal to that of the sun, that the popes
    have erred in their teaching? Could you do it and maintain that avaricious,
    incestuous, murdering, simoniacal popes have been vicars of Jesus Christ?
    Oh, venerable brethren! to maintain such an enormity would be to betray
    Christ worse than Judas. It would be to throw dirt in His face. [Cries,
    'Down from the pulpit, quick; shut the mouth of the heretic!']</p>
    <p align="center">[RETURN TO DIVINELY-INSPIRED HOLY SCRIPTURES]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My venerable brethren, you cry out; but would it not
    be more dignified to weigh my reasons and my proofs in the balance of the
    sanctuary? Believe me, history cannot be made over again; it is there, and
    will remain to all eternity, to protest energetically against the dogma of
    papal infallibility. You may proclaim it unanimously; but one vote will be
    wanting, and that is mine! Monsignori, the true and faithful have their eyes
    on us, expecting from us a remedy for the innumerable evils which dishonor
    the church: will you deceive them in their hopes? What will not our
    responsibility before God be, if we let this solemn oc-</p>
    <p>[pg. 22]</p>
    <p>casion pass which God has given us to heal the true faith? Let us seize
    it, my brethren; let us arm ourselves with a holy courage; let us make a
    violent and generous effort; let us turn to the teaching of the apostles,
    since without that we have only errors, darkness, and false traditions. Let
    us avail ourselves of our reason and of our intelligence to take the
    apostles and prophets as our only infallible masters with reference to the
    question of questions, &quot;What must I do to be saved?' When we have
    decided that, we shall have laid the foundation of our dogmatic system firm
    and immovable on the rock, lasting and incorruptible, of the divinely
    inspired holy Scriptures. Full of confidence, we will go before the world,
    and, like the apostle Paul, in the presence of the free-thinkers, we will
    'know none other than Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.' We will conquer
    through the preaching of 'the folly of the Cross,' as Paul conquered the
    learned men of Greece and Rome; and the Roman church will have its glorious
    '89 [Clamorous cries, 'Get down! Out with the Protestant, the Calvinist, the
    traitor of the church.'] Your cries, Monsignori, do not frighten me. If my
    words are hot, my head is cool. I am neither of Luther, nor of Calvin, nor
    of Paul, nor of Apollos, but of Christ. [Renewed cries, 'Anathema, anathema,
    to the apostate.']</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anathema? Monsignori, anathema? You know well that you
    are not protesting against me, but against the holy apostles under whose
    protection I should wish this Council to place the church. Ah! if wrapped in
    their winding-sheets they came out of their tombs, would they speak a
    language different from mine?</p>
    <p>[pg. 23]</p>
    <p>What would you say to them when by their writings they tell you that the
    papacy had deviated from the gospel of the Son of God, which they have
    preached and confirmed in so generous a manner by their blood? Would you
    dare say to them, We prefer the teaching of our own popes, our Bellarmine,
    our Ignatius Loyola, to yours? No, no! a thousand times, no! unless you have
    shut your ears that you may not hear, closed your eyes that you may not see,
    blunted your mind that you may not understand. Ah! if He who reigns above
    wishes to punish us, making His hand fall heavy on us, as He did on Pharaoh,
    He has no need to permit Garibaldi's soldiers to drive us away from the
    eternal city. He has only to let them make Pius IX a god, as we have made a
    goddess of the blessed Virgin. Stop, stop, venerable brethren, on the odious
    and ridiculous incline on which you have placed yourselves. Save the church
    from the shipwreck which threatens her, asking from the holy Scriptures
    alone for the rule of faith which we ought to believe and to profess. I have
    spoken: may God help me!</p>

  <p>This next item is from a speech prepared by Archbishop Peter Kenrick of St.

  the declaration of papal infallibility as dogma. Debate was ended before
  Archbishop Kenrick could deliver his speech, but it was printed and
  distributed to the bishops at the council anyway.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong><u>Archbishop Kenrick (1806-1897)</u></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p. 107] The rule of Biblical interpretation imposed upon us is this:
    that the Scriptures are not to be interpreted contrary to the unanimous
    consent of the fathers. It is doubtful whether any instance of that
    unanimous consent is to be found. But this failing, the rule seems to lay
    down for us the law of following, in their interpretation of Scripture, the
    major number of the fathers, that might seem to approach unanimity.
    Accepting this rule, we are compelled to abandon the usual modern exposition
    of the words, “On this rock I build my church.”</p>
    <p>In a remarkable pamphlet “printed in <em>fac-simile</em> of
    manuscript,” and presented to the fathers almost two months ago, we find
    five different interpretations of the word <em>rock</em>, in the place
    cited; “the first of which declares” (I transcribe the words) “that
    the church was built on <em>Peter</em>; and this interpretation is followed
    by <em>seventeen</em> fathers—among them, by Origen, Cyprian, Jerome,
    Hilary, Cyril of Alexandria, Leo the Great, Augustine.</p>
    <p>“The second interpretation understands from [p. 108] these words, ‘On
    this rock I build my church,’ that the church was built on <em>all</em>
    the apostles, whom Peter represented by virtue of the primary. And this
    opinion is followed by <em>eight</em> fathers—among them, Origen, Cyprian,
    Jerome, Augustine, Theodoret.</p>
    <p>“The third interpretation asserts that the words, ‘On this rock,’
    etc., are to be understood of the <em>faith</em> which Peter had
    professed—that this faith, this profession of faith, by which we believe
    Christ to be the Son of the living God is the everlasting and immovable
    foundation of the church. This interpretation is the weightiest of all,
    since it is followed by <em>forty-four</em> fathers and doctors; among them,
    from the East, are Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Alexandria, Chrysostom,
    Theophylact; from the West, Hilary, Ambrose, Leo the Great; from Africa,
    Augustine.</p>
    <p>“The fourth interpretation declares that the words, ‘On this rock,’
    etc., are to be understood of that rock which Peter had confessed, that is, <em>Christ</em>—the
    church was built upon Christ. This interpretation is followed by <em>sixteen</em>
    fathers and doctors.</p>
    <p>“The fifth interpretation of the fathers understands by the name of <em>the
    rock</em>, the <em>faithful</em> themselves, who, believing Christ to be the
    Son of God, are constituted living stones out of which the church is
    built.”</p>
    <p>Thus far the author of the pamphlet aforesaid, in which may be read the
    words of the fathers and doctors whom he cites.</p>
    <p>From this it follows, either that no argument at [p. 109] all, or one of
    the slenderest probability, is to be derived from the words, “On this rock
    will I build my church,” in support of the primacy. Unless it is certain
    that by the rock is to be understood the apostle Peter in his own person,
    and not in his capacity as the chief apostle speaking for them all, the word
    supplies no argument whatever, I do not say in proof of papal infallibility,
    but even in support of the <em>primacy</em> of the bishop of Rome. <strong>If
    we are bound to follow the majority of the fathers in this thing, then we
    are bound to hold for certain that by <em>the rock</em> should be understood
    the faith professed by Peter, not Peter professing the faith.</strong></p>

    apostles that they might be called the light of the world, thus also upon
    Simon, who believed in Christ the Rock [Latin, petra], He bestowed the name

    household word among Catholics, handled Matt. 16:18 as follows:</p>
    <p>&quot;Thou art Peter, and upon this rock which thou hast confessed . . .
    saying, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,' I will build my
    church.&quot;<br>
    [<strong> <a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF1-06/ecf3-26.htm">Sermon
    XXVI.,</a> </strong>On Matt. XIV. 25, paragraph 1.]</p>
    <p>And Hilary, another Catholic saint, whose day on the calendar is January
    13, wrote:</p>
    <p>&quot;This one foundation is immovable; that is, that one blessed rock of 
    faith, confessed by the mouth of Peter, 'Thou art the Son of the Living 
    God.' The building of the church is upon this rock of confession. This faith 
    hath the keys of the kingdom of heaven; what this faith shall loose or bind 
    is bound and loosed in heaven.&quot; [<a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-09/Npnf2-09-09.htm#P1012_627785"><strong>On 
    the Trinity, </strong>Book II,</a> paragraph 23.]</p>
    <p>In the writings of these Fathers, Peter loses his identity. The Catholic
    Church of to-day should either interpret Matt. 16:18 correctly, or pull St.
    Augustine and St. Hillary down from their high pedestals and consign them to
    purgatory for having misinterpreted it.</p>

    and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</strong><br>
    Mat 20:26 <strong>But it shall not be so among you:</strong> but whosoever
    will be great among you, let him be your minister;<br>
    Mat 20:27 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:<br>
    Mat 20:28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
    minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
    <p>Mark 10:42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know
    that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
    over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.<br>
    Mark 10:43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
    among you, shall be your minister:<br>
    Mark 10:44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of

    Mark 10:45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
    minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
    <p>Luke 22:25 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise
    lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called

    Luke 22:26 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let
    him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.<br>

  <p>Curiously, even the new Vatican Catechism confirms that it was Peter's <em>confession
  of faith</em>, and not Peter himself, that is the foundation rock upon which
  the church would be founded (emphasis is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>
    <p>424</strong> Moved by the grace on the Holy Spirit and drawn by the
    Father, we believe in Jesus and confess: &quot;You are the Christ, the Son
    of the living God.&quot; (Mat 16:16) <strong>On the rock of this faith
    confessed by St. Peter, Christ built his Church.</strong> (Mat 16:18, St Leo
    the Great - <em>Sermo</em> 4,3; <em>Sermo</em> 51,1; <em>Sermo</em> 62,2; <em>Sermo</em>
    83,3 )</p>
    <p><strong>442</strong> ... And in the synagogues immediately [Paul]
    proclaimed Jesus, saying, 'He is the Son of God.'&quot; (Acts 9:12) <strong>From
    the beginning this acknowledgment of Christ's divine sonship will be the
    center of the apostolic faith, first professed by Peter as the Church's
    foundation</strong>. ( <em>cf</em>. 1 Thess 1:10, Jn 20:31; Mt 16:18)</p>

  <p>The church is indeed founded on faith in Jesus Christ. In fact, it is the
  only sure foundation-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
    eternal life.<br>
    John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
    that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
    life.</p>
    <p>John 20:31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
    Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
    name.</p>
    <p>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
    cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them
    that diligently seek him.</p>
    <p>Mat 16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?<br>
    Mat 16:16 And Simon Peter answered and said, <strong>Thou art the Christ,
    the Son of the living God</strong>.<br>
    Mat 16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
    Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father
    which is in heaven.<br>
    Mat 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon <strong>this
    rock</strong> (of faith - that whosoever believeth in him, Jesus Christ) I
    will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
    (whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Rock of the Gospel message is Jesus Christ and faith in Him will indeed
  prevail over the gates of the grave.</p>
