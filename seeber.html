&quot;What does the word Vatican mean?</font></b></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following rebuttal is from Theodore Seeber, a Catholic, in response to
  a challenge of mine to prove any error in my essay on the Vatican. Portions of
  my original essay are represented here in gray boxes, followed by Theodore's
  comments which are bracketed by asterisks, to which I have then added my
  response if any.</p>

          <p>Where does the word &quot;Vatican&quot; come from and what does it
          mean?</p>
          <p>The word derives from the Latin vates, which means &quot;tellers of
          the future.&quot; This name was the name given to a hillside on the
          west bank of the Tiber River in Rome because daily lineups of
          fortunetellers used to hawk their &quot;wares&quot; there to passersby
          on the street. In the fourteenth century, when the papacy was returned
          to Rome from Avignon (France), the present-day Vatican became the
          residence of the popes, and the word came to refer to the enclave in
          the middle of Rome that had become the seat of the Roman Catholic
          Church.</p>
