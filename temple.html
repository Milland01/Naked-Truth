The Illustrated Plan of Salvation</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>This article will briefly explore the basic meaning behind the Hebrew
  Sanctuary, and how it reveals God's plan of Salvation for all of humanity.
  More specifically, we will be looking at the traveling, or portable Sanctuary,
  that Moses and the Israelites used following the giving of the law on mount
  Sinai. This Sanctuary was carried by the Israelites as they wandered in the
  wilderness for 40 years, until a more permanent structure could be built.</p>
  <p>In Exodus 25 Moses is shown the plan for the Tabernacle or Sanctuary. This
  plan was a simplified version of the heavenly Sanctuary or Tabernacle,
  designed to reveal that Jesus Christ is our High Priest, our mediator, in the
  plan of salvation-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 25:8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.<br>
    Exo 25:9 According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the
    tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye
    make it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img src="lamb.gif" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="100" height="100"></p>
  <h3>The Sacrifice to atone for sin.</h3>
  <p>Once it was built and functioning, the first step in the Sanctuary services
  was the offering of a sacrificial animal. This could be any of various
  animals, including a bullock, goat, lamb, or turtle doves offered for
  sacrifice by the repentant sinner. The sinner, by transgressing the law of
  God, recognizes that he faces the prospect of death -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
    is the transgression of the law.</p>
    <p>Rom 6:23 For the wages of sin is death;...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Sanctuary service provided an illustration of the way the sinner was to
  repent and atone for his sins. To bring home to the sinner the consequences of
  his sin, the sinner placed his hands on the head of the animal and confessed
  his sins to God. He was then required to slay the sacrificial animal by his
  own hand, as an offering for his sin, and collect the blood of the animal.
  This emphasized to the sinner that his transgression of the law of God was no
  small matter, and that death was the inevitable result. The animal that was
  sacrificed (usually a lamb) was symbolic for Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God,
  offered as a sacrifice in our place, so that we as sinners do not have to die
  for our sins.</p>
  <p>That was the full extent of the participation on the part of the sinner.
  From that point forward, all the rest of the service was conducted by a priest
  as mediator between the sinner and God. This was symbolic of Jesus our High
  Priest, our mediator between us and God the Father-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
    man Christ Jesus;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img src="burnt.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="265" height="217"></p>
  <h3>The Brazen Altar of Burnt Offerings.</h3>
  <p>Exo 27:1-8, 38:1-7.</p>
  <p>After confessing his sins over the animal and slaying it, the sinner let
  the priest as mediator take the lamb (or whatever animal was offered) and
  place selected portions of it (such as the fat, Lev. 4, 9) on the Brazen
  (Brass) Altar of Burnt Offerings, to be consumed by the flames. For those too
  poor to offer an animal, an offering of flour was permitted (Lev 5:11), which
  was also burned on the Altar. The Altar was constructed of Acacia wood,
  covered with brass. The Acacia wood symbolized the works of humanity, that but
  for the brass covering would be consumed by the fire. The brass was a symbol
  of suffering, so this Altar represented the suffering and death of Jesus
  Christ that covers and protects the repentant sinner from the divine fire of
  Judgment. The Altar had at each of its corners, a horn, representing the
  power, strength, honor, and victory of God. Before being sacrificed, the
  animal was secured to the horns of the Altar (Psa 118:27). Blood from the
  sacrificed animal was placed on the horns of the Altar by the priest, and the 
  rest was poured out at the bottom of the Altar (Exo 29:12, Lev 4:7). The fire for the
  Brazen Altar of Burnt Offerings was a special divinely lit fire, that was
  started by fire coming down out of heaven (Lev 9:24). This symbolically
  represents the fire that will ultimately consume all sinners, known as the
  lake of fire in Revelation.</p>
  <p><img src="laver.gif" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="98" height="125"></p>
  <h3>The Laver.</h3>
  <p>Exo 30:18-21, 38:8</p>
  <p>Located between the Brazen Altar of Burnt Offerings and the Sanctuary, the
  Laver was a basin filled with water used for ritual cleansing. The Laver was
  made from the brass &quot;looking glasses&quot; (mirrors) of the women. Before
  handling the animal sacrifices brought by the people, the priest would have to
  cleanse his hands and feet with water from the Laver. This was symbolic of the
  act of baptism. Baptism is a declaration of the repentant sinner that he has
  been buried with Jesus Christ and resurrected with him as a new creature (Rom
  6:4-13). The polished brass of the Laver is to be a &quot;looking glass&quot;
  revealing our sins, and showing us our need for a Savior, that we might be
  baptized and receive the righteousness that God offers us though His Son Jesus
  Christ. If the priest were to neglect this act of cleansing, he would be
  struck dead as a result (Exo 30:21). Why? Because to reject the cleansing
  righteousness of Jesus Christ is to die in one's own sin.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><u>Justification</u></h3>
  <p>The Brazen Altar of Burnt Offering and the Laver were both outside of the
  Sanctuary proper, to the immediate east of the entrance. It was also in this
  area that the animals were slain for the services. These activities carried on
  outside the Sanctuary represented the process of justification and
  reconciliation of the sinner through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross,
  and the acceptance of that vicarious sacrifice of the Lamb of God by the
  repentant sinner.</p>
  <p><img src="menorah.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="125" height="113"></p>
  <h3>The Golden Candlestick (Menorah).</h3>
  <p>Exo 25:31-39, 37:17-24.</p>
  <p>Inside the Sanctuary itself, in what is known as the first apartment, or
  Holy Place, were three pieces of furniture. To the south side of the room was
  a large golden candelabra, or Menorah, that had six branches off of a central
  candlestick. The Menorah used pure olive oil as fuel. It was the job of the
  priests to daily trim the wicks (which were made of old priestly garments) and
  refill the bowls of oil, so that the Menorah would constantly be a source of
  light for first apartment or Holy Place. The Menorah represented Jesus Christ,
  who is the light of the world, and the olive oil was symbolic of the Holy
  Spirit and the wicks were symbolic of the righteousness of Christ. The Menorah
  also represents the seven churches of Revelation, who are to share the light
  of the gospel message with the rest of the world. It can be found in
  Revelation 1:12 and 4:5.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the central candlestick is illustrated as being slightly taller
  than the others. The Menorah is also thought to be symbolic of the 7 days of
  creation, with the taller candlestick representing the Seventh - day
  (Saturday) Sabbath, the <i>only</i> week day that God sanctified (dedicated to
  a Holy purpose) -</p>

        Rome. The Menorah and other articles from Herod's Temple were apparently
        taken as war booty by Titus in 70 A.D. after the siege and destruction
        of Jerusalem by Roman armies. The Israeli government recently asked the
        Vatican to search its vaults for the Menorah, so that should they have
        it, it might be returned to the Jewish nation. This is unlikely, since
        Rome was completely sacked and looted in 410 A.D. by the Visigoths, and
        again in 455 A.D. by the Vandals. Anything of value (such as a large
        solid gold candlestick) was probably taken.</td>

  <h3>The Table of Showbread.</h3>
  <p>Exo 25:23-30, 37:10-16.</p>
  <p>On the north side of the Holy Place was a small table known as the table of
  Showbread. It was constructed of Acacia wood and covered with gold. On it were
  kept 12 loaves of unleavened bread (Lev 24:5-9). These loaves were symbolic of
  Jesus, who is the bread of life (Jn 6:35), but they also represent the 12
  tribes of Israel. Also kept on the Table of Showbread, were offerings of wine
  (Num 28:7), so both the bread and the wine of the Lord's supper were
  represented here. The Table of Showbread is alluded to in Revelation as a
  throne before the Candlestick, in chapter 4 verses 2-5.</p>
  <p><img src="incense.gif" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="137" height="127"></p>
  <h3>The Golden Altar of Incense.</h3>
  <p>Exo 30:1-10, 37:25-29.</p>
  <p>On the west side of the Holy Place, immediately before the veil separating 
  the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, was a small Golden Altar of Incense. 
  In it was a brass pot, containing hot coals from the Brazen Altar of Burnt 
  Offerings, and it was here that a very special blend of incense was burned by 
  the priest, which filled the Sanctuary with a sweet smelling cloud, and 
  obscured the glory of God over the mercy seat of the ark on the Day of 
  Atonement, preserving the life of the High Priest (Lev. 16:13). Sacrificial blood was sometimes put 
  on the horns of the Golden Altar of Incense <span LANG="EN">(Lev. 4:7, 18).</span> The Golden Altar
  of Incense also figures prominently in the book of Revelation (Rev 8:3-5) with
  regard to the end of judgment, or close of probation on humanity.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><u>Sanctification</u></h3>
  <p>The activities in the first apartment, or Holy place, represented the daily
  process of sanctification of the repentant sinner in preparation for the final
  judgment which occurred on the Day of Atonement, observed today as Yom Kippur.</p>
  <p><img src="veil.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="146" height="116"></p>
  <h3>The Veil of the Sanctuary</h3>
  <p>Exo. 26:31-33, 36:35, 2 Chron 3:14</p>
  <p>This veil or curtain between the two apartments of the Sanctuary, the Holy
  and the Most Holy, has great significance. This is because it was this veil
  that tore at the very moment Jesus died on the Cross, symbolic of the end of
  the need for the human Levitical priesthood as mediator between man and God-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
    top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
    <p>Mark 15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
    the bottom.</p>
    <p>Luke 23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent
    in the midst.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The veil represents the body of Jesus:</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px">Heb 10:19&nbsp;
	<span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.5em; TEXT-INDENT: 0px">Having therefore, 
	brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
	<br style="margin-left: 40px">Heb 10:20&nbsp; By a new and living way, which 
	he hath consecrated for us, through the <a id="essa" name="34253x15"></a>
	veil, that is to say, his flesh; </span></p>
	<p>It is only by this veil (door) that access is possible to the Most Holy place of judgment. The tearing
  of the veil is symbolic of the death of the Lamb of God, which now permits the
  believer in His atonement immediate access to the Most Holy place of God, the
  place of judgment, through the new High Priest Jesus Christ, the one and <i>only</i>
  mediator between man and God.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 2:5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the
    man Christ Jesus;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The faithful have full and complete access to God, without the need of an
  earthly mortal priest to represent them.</p>
  <p><img src="ark.gif" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="LEFT" width="126" height="124"></p>
  <h3>The Ark of the Testimony of God.</h3>
  <p>Exo 25:10-22, 37:1-9.</p>
  <p>This was a box constructed of Acacia wood covered with Gold. Inside it was
  kept the two tables of stone upon which the Law of God (The 10 Commandments)
  was written. Later it also contained Aaron's rod that budded, and a pot of
  manna. The lid of the Ark was called the Mercy Seat (Exo 25:17), and above it
  was where the glory of the Lord was present, between two covering cherubs, or
  angels, on either end of the Ark. The Mercy seat, or lid, represented Jesus
  Christ, the mediator for humanity between the Law of God, that requires the
  death of the sinner, and a merciful God. The High Priest was the only person
  allowed to enter the Most Holy place where the Ark was kept, and that was only
  on one day of the year, the Day of Atonement (known today as Yom Kippur).</p>
  <p>The Ark of the Testimony from Solomon's Temple was secreted away before the
  Babylonian capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar and was never present in
  Herod's Temple. The armies of Titus found the Holy of Holies quite empty in 70
  A.D. The Ark remains unlocated today, although there are numerous speculations
  about its whereabouts.</p>
  <p>In Revelation (which was written about 95 A.D.), the Ark is seen in Chapter
  11, verse 19. It is interesting to note that John is seeing the Ark of God in
  the heavenly Sanctuary, not the earthly Sanctuary (which was utterly destroyed
  in 70 A.D. by the armies of Rome).</p>
  <h3 align="center"><u>Judgment</u></h3>
  <p>The activities on the day of Atonement symbolized the people of God,
  seeking representation by their High Priest Jesus Christ in the judgment, who
  met all the demands of the law perfectly and then was sacrificed for our sins.
  He paid the price for our disobedience, though he was perfectly obedient. The
  Hebrew Sanctuary illustrates that ultimately all humanity will be judged by
  the standards of God's Law. Those with faith will keep the Law perfectly
  through Jesus Christ. Those without faith will not have been able to keep the
  Law of God, and must die as a result. After all, the wages of sin is death.
  Since the Law of God <i>could not be changed</i>, Jesus died for us, in our
  place, to satisfy the Law.</p>
  <p>By faith, we will take on the righteousness of Christ and be judged as
  keepers of the Law, with a right to the tree of life and eternal life.</p>
  <p>Just as all Israel sought representation by the High Priest on that day, we
  should be fervently seeking our High Priest, Jesus Christ, to represent us in
  Judgment.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b></p>
  <p>The Hebrew Sanctuary figures so prominently in the book of Revelation that
  you MUST understand the symbology of the Sanctuary and the yearly Sabbaths to
  really understand what John is trying to relate in Revelation. The Sanctuary
  is presented in Revelation as follows-
  <ul>
    <li>The Golden Candlestick - Rev 1:12, 4:5</li>
    <li>The Table of Showbread - Rev 4:2-5<ul>
    <li>Pre-Advent Investigative <a href="judgment.html">Judgment</a> begins, 
    Rev 4 - 6, see <a href="KeyofDavid.html">Key of the House of David</a></li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Brazen Altar of Burnt Offerings - Rev 6:9</li>
    <li>The Golden Altar of Incense - Rev 8:3-5, 9:13</li>
    <li>The Ark of the Testimony of God - Rev 11:19<ul>
    <li>The Temple closed to all men, Pre-Advent Investigative Judgment ended - Rev 15:8, 22:11</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Second Coming - Rev 19:11-16, Rev 22:12<ul>
    <li>The <a href="millen.html">Millennium</a> - Rev. 20:1-3,&nbsp; Saints 
    judge the wicked - Rev 20:4</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Great White Throne Executive Judgment of the wicked - Rev 20:11-13</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This shows a progressive sequence in Revelation detailing the
  <a href="judgment.html">Judgment</a>, the first phase of which ends in Revelation 8:3-5 with the throwing down of the
  golden censer, illustrating the close of probation, the conclusion of the mediation of the High Priest
  (Jesus Christ) on the behalf of the people of God.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="ark2.gif" width="309" height="138"></p>
  <p>So, if that is clear to you, then on what basis can anyone claim the Law of
  God, the Ten Commandments, the very focus of the Day of Atonement (Judgment
  Day), has been done away with? It is the very standard by which all humanity
  will be held accountable to God. It was by questioning, doubting, and then
  breaking God's Law that sin entered into the world in the first place. Those
  with faith will find mercy and atonement from God the Father through Jesus,
  and be restored to the pre-fall nature. Those without faith will face God's Law
  without an advocate, and the Law will condemn them to death. God's Law will
  stand unchanged and unyielding, the very character of God (love) expressed in
  words. The wicked will pay the price for their sins, and perish due to their
  lack of faith in Jesus, the one and only High Priest or mediator able to
  reconcile them with the Law of God, the Ten Commandments.</p>
  <p>The entire Hebrew Sanctuary and it's related Sabbaths illustrated God's
  plan of salvation for all of mankind in a graphic way to reveal Jesus Christ
  as Savior and Redeemer.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
    am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.<br>
    Mat 5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
    one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br>
    Mat 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
    and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of
    heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called
    great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
    <p>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
    that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
    life.<br>
    John 3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but
    that the world through him might be saved.<br>
    John 3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
    not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
    only begotten Son of God.</p>
