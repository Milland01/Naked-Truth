<blockquote><b>"I am God on the Earth" </b><br>
  <br>
  <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <small>FRIEND</small> in
Rome sends us the following, for the truth of which he can absolutely
vouch:&#8213;'Those who have difficulty in believing the full extent of the
papal claim may lay the following to heart. Easter-tide is a time when
multitudes of Roman Catholic children make their first Communion.&nbsp;
This year many of them, through those priests who had prepared them for
Communion, requested to be received in audience by Pius XI. The request
was granted, and 30th April was fixed for the great event. One who was
present describes the function as follows:&#8213;"We passed into the Vatican
precincts at 11 o'clock amid a throng of priests, nuns, and boys and
girls who had made their first Communion the week previous in the
various churches of Rome. From&nbsp; 11 to 12.30 we were marched
through several magnificent halls, and finally ordered in close files
behind a cordon of the Swiss Guard in the Throne Room. At last all was
in readiness, and preceded by members of the Noble Guard, flanked by
Cardinals, and followed by a crowd of Bishops, the Pope arrived. All
fell on their knees, and listened to the words which Pius XI addressed
to them as he stood on the steps of the Throne. In a monotonous voice,
and with an expression of great haughtiness, he spoke almost as
follows:&#8213;'You have requested the honour, boys and girls, of being
received in the Vatican on the occasion of making your First Communion,
by me who am the Holy Father. This your request is a proof of the depth
of your religious sentiments. You know that I am the Holy Father, the
representative of God on the earth, the Vicar of Christ, which means
that I am God on the earth. You have desired to have my benediction:
God Himself through me imparts it to you. You know those great
churches, St John Lateran and St Peter's, which are in Rome, the
Eternal City, the city that is ours. To-day you find yourselves in the
Vatican, and you must ever remember this day as one of the most
beautiful in your lives. I impart the benediction to you and to your
families.' Having spoken thus, the Pope passed slowly down our ranks,
imparting the benediction, while the priests who followed behind him
kissed the hem of his purple robe. Finally, he left the Throne Room
with the same ceremonial which had attended his entrance. The
impression that remained with one was that of boundless pride and a sad
ineptitude to find any thoughts worthy of such an occasion."' &#8213; Rev. A.
