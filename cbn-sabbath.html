<title>IS SATURDAY OR SUNDAY THE TRUE SABBATH?</title>

  <p align="center"><font size="4">Pat Robertson's CBN poses the question:<br>
  </font><b>IS SATURDAY OR SUNDAY THE TRUE SABBATH?</b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>I think the true Sabbath is a day of rest -- one out of seven days. Jesus 
  said, &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath&quot; (Mark 2:27). 
  By that He meant that God has set up a cyclical type of existence for us, 
  where it is absolutely imperative that we take a break in our work to rest, to 
  be refreshed, to think of things of the Spirit, and to worship Him. Moslems 
  celebrate Friday, Jews Saturday, and Christians Sunday. It is hard to say that 
  one day has any benefit over another. The apostle Paul says in Colossians that 
  we are not to be bound by any days. He tells us that we are not saved through 
  the observance of Sabbath days or various feast days, because such things are 
  just a shadow of the truth and the truth is Jesus Christ (Colossians 2:16-17). 
  So in a sense we have a Sabbath rest in Jesus Christ all the time. </p>
  <p>From a practical standpoint, I believe that people should read Isaiah 58 
  and see what it says about keeping the Sabbath. We should dedicate a day to 
  the Lord, a day when we do not think our own thoughts or spend time in 
  business or worldly pleasure but when we rest and meditate on Him. God says, 
  in Isaiah 58, that if we do that, we will receive the heritage of Jacob and we 
  will ride on the high places of the earth. That is a wonderful promise. </p>
  <p>I have found that in my own life, taking a day off, which for me is Sunday, 
  is a most welcome time. It is a time when I am not watching television or 
  going to ball games or running around. Instead, I am seeking God. I am 
  praying, I am studying, I am reading the Word, I am talking to the Lord, and I 
  am being refreshed with rest. Setting aside one day a week for your Sabbath 
  can make a tremendous difference in your life. </p>
  <p>The reason Christians worship on Sunday instead of Saturday is that Sunday 
  is the day of the Resurrection. Jesus rose from the grave on Sunday, and the 
  Christian church celebrates that day. The early Jewish believers probably also 
  kept Saturday as a rest day. Remember, however, that those who would be 
  legalistic in this affair of literal Sabbath-keeping should stop work at 
  sundown on Friday, observe complete rest, and not work again until sundown on 
  Saturday. Frankly, I do not believe that Christians have to keep Jewish 
  customs in order to please God. Jesus has fulfilled all the demands of the law 
  so that His followers might live under grace (see Romans 6:15, Galatians 
  4:4-7). <font face="Times New Roman">&#8213; From the
