He is   the Minister-at-large of <strong><a href="http://www.tcotw.org/">The Church On   The Way</a></strong> in Van Nuys, California. In that article, Pastor Hayford   states the following, which is an excerpt:</p></blockquote><div align="center">  <center>  <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#E6E6F2" width="85%">    <tr>      <td>      <blockquote>        <p>The Sabbath is viewed in different ways. Some people think of it as         the seventh day of the week, or Saturday, and they fervently treat it as         the day that must be observed for worship of our Lord. I don't have any         quarrel with people who choose to do this. A number of traditions do -         most notably our friends, the Seventh Day Adventists. I have many         friends in that tradition who know and love Jesus Christ dearly, and I         respect their choice of that day. Surely we could learn from them the         wisdom of setting aside a regular day for worship and rest.</p>        <p>Others will insist that Sunday is the &quot;Christian Sabbath,&quot; but that         is not accurate either. The Bible refers to Sunday as &quot;the Lord's Day.&quot;         On this day Jesus rose from the dead, and we celebrate on the first day         of each week to renew the covenant of His Resurrection and live out His         Resurrection life for another week. ...</p>        <p>... The Lord says &quot;... if you keep your feet from breaking the         Sabbath and doing as you please on My holy day, then you will find your         joy in the Lord, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land         and to feast on the inheritance of your father, Jacob&quot; (Isaiah         58:13,14).</p>        <p>©1999 Living Way Ministries,<br>        14820 Sherman Way<br>        Van Nuys, CA 91405-2233<br>        (818)779-8400</p>      </blockquote>      </td>    </tr>  </table>  </center></div><blockquote>  <p>Please read the entire article at <strong>  <a href="http://www.livingway.com/articles/sabbath_ques.htm">  The Sabbath Question</a>.</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p align="left">Pastor Hayford,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   September 26th , 1999</p>  <p align="left">This letter to you is an open letter, and has been posted on   my web page at <a href="http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/hayford.htm">  http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/hayford.htm</a><br>  You are invited to reply, and I will append your response to that web page.</p>  <p align="left">I have read your article &quot;The Sabbath Question&quot; on your web   page with great interest. Knowing that you are a very articulate and   intelligent individual, I as a Seventh-day Adventist I would like to clarify   that Adventists did not choose the Saturday Sabbath, rather we obey the fourth   Commandment of God (Exo. 20:8-11) which specifies that the seventh day (of the   week) is to be the Sabbath day. That a specific day is to be kept in unison,   and not just an arbitrary seven day cycle subject to the whims of personal   choice, is plain from the fact that for 40 years in the wilderness no manna   fell on the day which the Lord had specified as the Sabbath (Exo. 16), and   those who chose to disobey and did not observe the specified day, incited the   anger of the Lord (Exo. 16:27-28). So we Adventists did not choose the day,   God did, but it IS true that Adventists choose to obey the fourth Commandment   of God and remember and keep holy the day that He very clearly specified.   Isaiah 58:13,14 which you have quoted, refers not to Sunday, but specifically   to the seventh day Saturday Sabbath, God's holy day.</p>  <p align="left">Also, I find it very curious that you frame the Adventists   keeping of the seventh day of the week with the word &quot;tradition&quot; and then   proceed to boldly assert that &quot;The Bible refers to Sunday as &quot;the Lord's Day&quot;   to justify your keeping of Sunday, but do not give a reference. As a diligent   student of the Bible I have devoted a lot of study to this matter, and must   say I am utterly at a loss to find where the Bible declares Sunday is &quot;the   Lord's Day&quot;. Indeed, I can only find one verse in which the exact phrase &quot;the   Lord's day&quot; appears:</p>  <blockquote>    <p>Rev 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a     great voice, as of a trumpet,</p>  </blockquote></blockquote><blockquote>  <p align="left">I cannot find anything in Revelation that even hints that John   was speaking of a particular day of the week, much less Sunday. However, the   phrase &quot;day of the Lord&quot; does appear some 25 times in scripture, and every   instance is a reference to the second coming. The prophetic context of the   Revelation would more likely indicate that John was in the spirit to witness   visions of the events related to the second coming (the Lord's day / day of   the Lord), rather than his being in the spirit on Sunday. Whether you agree   with that or not, would you agree that Rev 1:10 does NOT state that Sunday is   the Lord's day, and that nowhere does the Bible make this association? If you   wish to still maintain this, then just where exactly does the Bible designate   Sunday as &quot;the Lord's day&quot;? Please cite chapter and verse.</p>  <p align="left">Now I sincerely respect your choice to observe any day you   want, Sunday included, but isn't Sundaykeeping, in fact, a tradition of the   Roman Catholic Church, a tradition which you choose to adopt despite there   being no biblical &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot; for Sunday holiness, and despite the   fact that God in His Ten Commandments clearly and explicitly requires the   seventh-day (Saturday) be remembered and kept holy? Aren't you really keeping   an unbiblical Catholic tradition, while we Adventists are remembering and   keeping holy one of the Ten Commandments of God?</p>  <p align="left">I await either your proof that Sunday is called &quot;the Lord's   day&quot; in the Bible, and should be remembered and kept holy, or failing that,   your admission that Sundaykeeping is nothing but an unbiblical tradition,   indeed a commandment of only the Catholic Church, which you choose to follow   instead of the explicit fourth Commandment of God.</p>  <p align="left">This letter to you can be found in the following section of my   web page, with other articles on the same topic, which you will likely find to   be of interest:</p>  <p align="left">The Battle of Armageddon<br>  <a href="http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/index_two.htm">  http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/index_two.htm</a></p>  <p align="left">Respectfully,</p>  <p align="left">Michael Scheifler<br>  Bible Light Homepage<br>  <a href="index.html">http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/</a></p>  <hr>  <p align="left">The following written reply was received on October 29th, not   from Pastor Hayford directly, but from his correspondence department. It is   apparently a form letter routinely sent to those who write Pastor Hayford   about the Sabbath:</p>  <font size="2">  <div align="center">    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#E6E6F2" width="85%">      <tr>        <td><font size="2">        <blockquote>          <p align="right">&nbsp;<br>          <a href="http://www.livingway.com/">LIVING WAY MINISTRIES<br>          presenting the ministry of&nbsp;<br>          PASTOR JACK HAYFORD</a></p>          </font></font>          <p align="center"><font size="3">October 13, 1999</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">Dear Mr. Scheifler:</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for           writing to Pastor Jack Hayford and Living Way Ministries. Please           forgive the delay in responding. Because Pastor Hayford receives so           much mail, he is not able to answer it all himself. He is sorry for           this and wishes he could personally respond to all who so graciously           write him. I have been asked to respond to your letter in his behalf.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding your           question about the observance of the Sabbath vs. Sunday or the Lord's           day, there are no scriptures which state that the Church is not to           observe Saturday as the Sabbath and instead to worship on the Lord's           day. However, you will find that Christ preached against the legalism           of the Pharisees when they demanded that He keep the Sabbath (see Luke           6:2) reminding them that He was Lord of the Sabbath. <u>The emphasis           here is on Him, not on the day</u>. All days are to be kept sacred to           the Lord.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have           extensive teaching from the Apostle Paul in Romans against the           legalistic approach to the Sabbath and against legalism in what kinds           of food are allowable. He spoke clearly against this legalism in every           aspect of life. In this passage (Romans 14:5-14), Paul teaches about           those who observe one day above another saying, &quot;One person esteems           one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be           fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it           to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does           not observe it.&quot;</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He continues to talk           about foods as a good example of the legalism of the Pharisees. He           could just as easily have continued to use the observance of days, but           chose foods. The principle he was teaching applies to all aspects of           the Christian life.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find that           many of the Old Testament laws are not kept by today's Church. The           dietary laws were set aside when God spoke to Peter in Acts 10 when He           was teaching Peter that the Gentiles were not to be excluded from the           reach of the Gospel.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sabbath           observance was a part of the ceremonial law of the Old Testament,           along with such things as circumcision and eating restrictions. These           ceremonial laws showed that the Israelites were set apart (sanctified)           from all other nations (Exodus 31:12, 13).</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Testament           shows that all ceremonial law (restrictive eating - 1 Timothy 4:4, 5           and the above passage in Acts, circumcision - 1 Corinthians 7:18, and           Sabbath-keeping - Colossians 2:16, 17) was fulfilled in Christ, and           our need to observe it for justification and sanctification abolished.           We are even warned against Sabbath-keepers who want to judge others           for not keeping it: &quot;Let no man judge you...regarding...sabbaths&quot;           (Colossians 2:16).</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bible teaches           that the important thing is to keep a pure heart before God. The           Romans 14 passage spells this out clearly. The heart attitude is the           important thing.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Scheifler, I           believe it wounds God's heart to see His children tearing one another           down. Psalm 133:1 says, &quot;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for           brethren to dwell together in unity&quot; Paul, in the book of Romans says,           each one of us have come to a place (chapters 13, 14) that we be wise           to learn that when we find brothers or sisters in Christ that hold a           different position than us, that we not be so quick to pass judgment           on them because they ate accountable to Him (speaking of those that           kept to the Sabbath and those that didn't, differences in eating           habits, etc.). He emphasizes the fact that our lives are lived out           under the Lordship of Jesus and not under the control or dominion of           one another.</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I would desire           to communicate to you can be summed up in the following quote: &quot;In           essentials, unity--in non-essentials, liberty--in all things,           charity.&quot; We are thankful that we stand with you as believers in our           Lord Jesus Christ, who gave up everything to come to earth and be born           of a virgin, then lived a sinless life, which led Him to the death of           the Cross, but Who then rose again from the grave and because of this,           as we believe, we are blessed with eternal life (Romans 10:9, 10).</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have enclosed one           of Pastor Hayford's teaching tapes that I believe will be helpful in           your further study on this matter. Thank you again for writing. I pray           God's richest blessings on you as you continue to seek His will in           serving Him.</font></p>          <blockquote>            <blockquote>              <blockquote>                <p align="left"><font size="3">Sincerely in Christ,</font></p>                <p align="left"><font size="3">Lesli Smith<br>                Correspondence Department</font></p>              </blockquote>            </blockquote>          </blockquote>        </blockquote>        <font size="2"><center>        <p>&nbsp;</p>        </center></font></td>      </tr>    </table>  </div>  <p><font size="3">Note that it is admitted that:</font></p>  <blockquote>    <p><font size="3">&quot;there are no scriptures which state that the Church is     not to observe Saturday as the Sabbath and instead to worship on the Lord's     day.&quot;</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font size="3">This is indeed true. Nowhere does the Bible designate Sunday   as a replacement for the Saturday Sabbath, however that does not answer the   question posed to Pastor Hayford, and neither does the rest of the response,   which attempts to justify abandoning the seventh-day Sabbath of the fourth   commandment of God for Sundaykeeping. &quot;<i>The Bible refers to Sunday as &quot;the   Lord's Day</i>&quot;, claims Pastor Hayford, but I will again ask him to please   explain that statement, and cite chapter and verse where the Bible   specifically refers to Sunday as being <i>&quot;the Lord's Day</i>&quot;. The following   email was received in answer to the question:</font></p>  <div align="center">    <table border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#E6E6F2" width="85%">      <tr>        <td>        <blockquote>          <p align="right"><br>          <font size="3">November 3, 1999</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">Dear Michael:</font></p>          <p align="left"><font size="3">Regarding &quot;the Lord's Day,&quot; the only           reference to that in the Bible is Revelation 1:10, where John says, &quot;I           was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day...&quot; This reference is speaking of           the first day of the week. This is the earliest reference to this in           Christian literature. According to Nelson's Illustrated Bible           Dictionary it says:</font></p>          <blockquote>            <p align="left"><font size="3">&quot;A special honor was reserved for             Sunday, the first day of the week. This was the day on which Jesus             was raised from the dead; every Lord's Day, therefore, is a weekly             memorial of Christ's resurrection. Clearly the early church             assembled for worship and religious instruction on Sunday, the             Lord's Day (I Corinthians 16:2).</font></p>            <p align="left"><font size="3">&quot;The Lord's Day is not to be confused             with the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. The Jewish Sabbath             corresponds with our Saturday, the seventh or last day of the week.             This special day to the Jews commemorated the day on which God             rested after the creation of the world. The Lord's Day is our             Sunday, the first day of the week; it celebrates the resurrection of             Jesus from the dead.&quot;</font></p>          </blockquote>          <p align="left"><font size="3">Sincerely,<br>          <br>          Lesli Smith<br>          Correspondence Department</font></p>        </blockquote>        </td>      </tr>    </table>  </div>  <p><font size="3">Now on this point I most certainly disagree.</font></p>  <p><font size="3">The Bible nowhere designates the first day of the week to be  <i>the Lord's day</i>, to include Revelation 1:10. Even Roman Catholics have   concluded that the phrase <i>the Lord's day </i>in Revelation does <i>not</i>   refer to Sunday (See <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">  <a href="chalng.html"><b>Rome's Challenge</b></a>). And 1 Cor. 16:2 offers no   refuge for the Protestant Sunday-keeper either (See  <img border="0" src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b>  <a href="firstday.html">Did the Apostle's Keep Sunday</a></b>). Despite what   Nelson's Illustrated Bible Dictionary says on the matter, there is nothing in   the New Testament that indicates Sunday was to be adopted as a holy day that   should be observed on a weekly basis. The Protestant rule on this is Sola   Scriptura, the scriptures <i>only</i> for doctrine, and there is only one day   of the week that God commands to be remembered and kept holy, and that is   without question the seventh-day (Saturday) Sabbath:</font></p>  </font>  <blockquote>    <p>Mat 12:8 <font color="#FF0000">For the Son of man is Lord even of the     sabbath day.</font></p>    <p>Mark 2:28 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of     the sabbath.</font></p>    <p>Luke 6:5 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">That the Son of man     is Lord also of the sabbath.</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above verses it is quite clear that Jesus Christ   is the Lord of the Sabbath day, referring to the biblical sabbath, the sabbath   instituted at creation and written on tables of stone by the finger of God (Exo.   20:8-11). The only day of the week John would have considered to be &quot;the   Lord's day&quot; was not Sunday, but the biblical seventh day Saturday Sabbath   spoken of by Jesus Himself.</p>  <font size="2">  <p><font size="3">Pastor Hayford simply cannot provide a shred of biblical <i>  proof </i>that Sunday is &quot;the Lord's day&quot;, that should kept on a weekly basis,   but he is quite welcome to follow the Catholic Tradition of doing so.</font></p>  <hr></blockquote><div align="center">  <center>  <table align="CENTER">    <tr>      <td align="CENTER"><font size="5"><a href="index.html">      <img src="blh8.gif" align="CENTER" border="0" width="270" height="60"><br>      <font size="2" font color="#000000">http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/</font></a></font></td>    </tr>  </table>  </center></div></font></body>
