  <title>The Abomination of Desolation</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">The Abomination that makes Desolate</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Who commits the abomination?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 7:30 For <font color="#800080">the children of Judah </font>have
done evil in my sight, saith the LORD:<font color="#800080"> they have
set their abominations in the house which is called by my name</font>,
to pollute it.</p>
    <p>Jer 32:32 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and
of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger,
they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,
and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<br>
Jer 32:33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face:
though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have
not hearkened to receive instruction.<br>
Jer 32:34 <font color="#800080">But they set their abominations in the
house, which is called by my name,</font> to defile it.</p>
    <p>Ezek 8:6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou
what they do? even the great <font color="#800080"><u>abominations</u>
that the house of Israel committeth</font> here, that I should go far
off from my sanctuary? ...</p>
    <p>Ezek 16:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
Ezek 16:2 Son of man, <font color="#800080">cause Jerusalem to know
her <u>abominations</u>,</font><br>
... <br>
Ezek 16:15 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on
every one that passed by; his it was.<br>
Ezek 16:16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like
things shall not come, neither shall it be so.<br>
Ezek 16:17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men,
and didst commit whoredom with them,<br>
...<br>
Ezek 16:30 How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou
doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;<br>
...<br>
Ezek 16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The people of God, symbolized by Jerusalem, have committed the
abominations, and as a result are called a harlot. What is the result
of committing these abominations?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 7:34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah,
and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for <u><font
 color="#800080"> the land shall be desolate.</font></u></p>
    <p>Jer 9:11 <font color="#800080">And I will make Jerusalem heaps</font>,
and a den of dragons; and <font color="#800080">I will make the cities
of Judah <u>desolate</u>, without an inhabitant.</font></p>
    <p>Jer 12:10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have
trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a
desolate wilderness.<br>
Jer 12:11 They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth
unto me; <font color="#800080">the whole land is made <u>desolate</u></font>,
because no man layeth it to heart.</p>
    <p>Jer 18:15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned
incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways
from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;<br>
Jer 18:16 <font color="#800080">To make their land <u>desolate</u></font>,
and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be
astonished, and wag his head.</p>
    <p>Ezek 33:28 For <font color="#800080">I will lay the land most <u>desolate</u></font>,
and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and <font color="#800080">the
mountains of Israel shall be <u>desolate</u>, that none shall pass
through.</font><br>
Ezek 33:29 Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when <u> <font
 color="#800080"> I have laid the land most desolate because of all
their abominations which they have committed.</font></u></p>
    <p>Hosea 13:16 Samaria <font color="#800080">shall become <u>desolate</u>;
for she hath rebelled against her God</font>: they shall fall by the
sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with
child shall be ripped up.<br>
Hosea 14:1 O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; <font
 color="#800080">for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity</font>.</p>
    <p>Micah 7:13 Notwithstanding <font color="#800080">the land shall
be <u> desolate</u> because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit
of their doings.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What abominations have been committed?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Prov 28:9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
even his prayer shall be abomination.</p>
    <p>Deu 17:2 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates
which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought
wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in <font color="#800080">transgressing
his covenant</font>,<br>
Deu 17:3 And hath gone and <font color="#800080">served other gods,
and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of
heaven</font>, which I have not commanded;<br>
Deu 17:4 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired
diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that <font
 color="#800080">such abomination is wrought in Israel:</font><br>
Deu 17:5 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that
woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.</p>
    <p>Ezek 8:1 And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth
month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the
elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there
upon me.<br>
Ezek 8:2 Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire:
from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his
loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of
amber.<br>
Ezek 8:3 And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of
mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the
heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door
of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of
the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.<br>
Ezek 8:4 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there,
according to the vision that I saw in the plain.<br>
Ezek 8:5 Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the
way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the
north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar <font
 color="#800080">this image of jealousy</font> in the entry.<br>
Ezek 8:6 He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they
do? even <font color="#800080">the great <u>abominations</u> that the
house of Israel committeth here</font>, that I should go far off from
my sanctuary? ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ezekiel was shown an idolatrous image/idol of a pagan god within
the temple courts,&nbsp;which is described as a great abomination. But
there is even more to see:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 8:6&nbsp; ... but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see
greater <font color="#800080"><u>abominations</u></font>.<br>
Ezek 8:7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
behold a hole in the wall.<br>
Ezek 8:8 Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and
when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.<br>
Ezek 8:9 And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked <font
 color="#800080"><u>abominations</u></font> that they do here.<br>
Ezek 8:10 So I went in and saw; and behold <font color="#800080">every
form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of
the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.</font><br>
Ezek 8:11 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of
the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son
of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of
incense went up.<br>
Ezek 8:12 Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the
ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the
chambers of his <font color="#800080">imagery</font>? for they say,
The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ezekiel is shown elders of Israel offering incense to images of
pagan gods on the walls of a secret temple chamber. But there is worse
to come:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 8:13 He said also unto me, Turn thee yet again, and thou
shalt see greater <font color="#800080"><u>abominations</u></font>
that they do.<br>
Ezek 8:14 Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S
house which was toward the north; and, behold, <font color="#800080">there
sat women weeping for Tammuz.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Tammuz was the Babylonian god of crops and vegetation who "died"
every year with the summer drought, and was therefore mourned. But the
greatest abomination was next to be revealed:</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">The Greatest Abomination</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 8:15 Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of
man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater <font
 color="#800080"><u>abominations</u></font> than these.<br>
Ezek 8:16 And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house,
and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch
and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward
the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and <font
 color="#800080">they worshipped the sun toward the east.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <i>greatest</i> abomination shown to Ezekiel, and committed
by Israel, was worshipping the sun!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 8:17 Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of
man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the <font
 color="#800080"> <u>abominations</u></font> which they commit here?
for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to
provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose.<br>
Ezek 8:18 Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare,
neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud
voice, yet will I not hear them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God's people played the harlot with pagan gods, and committed the
rankest abomination of sun worship. The presence of God was even shown
to Ezekiel departing the temple, leaving it desolate:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 11:22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the
wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them
above.<br>
Ezek 11:23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the
city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God promised to punish Israel's apostasy. For their abominations,
God promises the punishment of <i>desolation</i> of their land. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 7:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,<br>
Ezek 7:2 Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land
of Israel; An end, <font color="#800080">the end is come upon the four
corners of the land.</font></p>
    <p>Ezek 23:2 Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one
mother:<br>
... <br>
Ezek 23:4 And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her
sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were
their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.<br>
...<br>
Ezek 23:33 Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the
cup of astonishment and <font color="#800080"> <u>desolation</u></font>,
with the cup of thy sister Samaria.<br>
Ezek 23:34 Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt
break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have
spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Ezekiel is shown in vision that not all of God's people are guilty
of abomination, and they are to be spared the wrath of God, but the
wicked would all be slain:</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">Begin at my Sanctuary</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 9:4 And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the
city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads
of the men that sigh and that cry for all the <font color="#800080"><u>abominations</u></font>
that be done in the midst thereof.<br>
Ezek 9:5 And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him
through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye
pity:<br>
Ezek 9:6 Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children,
and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin
at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before
the house.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The fulfillment of Ezekiel's vision is recorded in Zechariah:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Zec 7:5 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the
priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?<br>
...<br>
Zec 7:11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
stopped their ears, that they should not hear.<br>
Zec 7:12 <u>Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they
should hear the law,</u> and the words which the LORD of hosts hath
sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath
from the LORD of hosts.<br>
Zec 7:13 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:<br>
Zec 7:14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
whom they knew not. Thus <font color="#800080">the land was <u>desolate</u></font>
after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for <font
 color="#800080">they laid the pleasant land <u>desolate</u>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The fulfillment is also recorded in 2nd Chronicles:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Chr 36:14 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the
people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in
Jerusalem.<br>
2 Chr 36:15 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion
on his people, and on his dwelling place:<br>
2 Chr 36:16 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his
words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
against his people, till there was no remedy.<br>
2 Chr 36:17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees,
who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or
him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand.<br>
2 Chr 36:18 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small,
and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the
king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.<br>
2 Chr 36:19 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed
all the goodly vessels thereof.<br>
2 Chr 36:20 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign
of the kingdom of Persia:<br>
2 Chr 36:21 <font color="#800080">To fulfil the word of the LORD by
the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as
long as she lay <u>desolate</u> she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore
and ten [70] years.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jeremiah had also prophesied the desolation of the land by Babylon:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 25:9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the
north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my
servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the
inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and
will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an
hissing, and perpetual desolations.<br>
Jer 25:10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the
voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.<br>
Jer 25:11 <font color="#800080">And this whole land shall be a <u>desolation</u>,
and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon
seventy years.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But before this happened, the people were warned. The punishment
of desolation could be avoided:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 6:8 <font color="#800080">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem</font>,
lest my soul depart from thee; <font color="#800080">lest I make thee
desolate, a land not inhabited.</font></p>
    <p>Jer 17:27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the
sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of
Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates
thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not
be quenched.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This was a warning they had heard before, after being freed from
bondage in Egypt:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary:
I am the LORD.<br>
    <br>
Lev 26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
the LORD.</p>
    <p>Ezek 20:12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign
between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that
sanctify them.<br>
Ezek 20:13 But <font color="#800080">the house of Israel rebelled
against me</font> in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes,
and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live
in them; <font color="#800080">and my sabbaths they greatly polluted:
then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, <u>to
consume them.</u></font></p>
    <p>Ezek 20:19 I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep
my judgments, and do them;<br>
Ezek 20:20 And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me
and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.<br>
    <br>
Ezek 23:38 Moreover this they have done unto me: <u>they have defiled
my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The punishment of desolation for sabbath breaking is clearly set
forth:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lev 26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but
walk contrary unto me;<br>
Lev 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.<br>
Lev 26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of
your daughters shall ye eat.<br>
Lev 26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your
images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
soul shall abhor you.<br>
Lev 26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.<br>
Lev 26:32 And <font color="#800080">I will bring the land into
desolation:</font> and your enemies which dwell therein shall be
astonished at it.<br>
Lev 26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
sword after you: and <font color="#800080">your land shall be desolate</font>,
and your cities waste.<br>
Lev 26:34 <font color="#800080">Then shall the land enjoy her
sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies'
land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</font><br>
Lev 26:35 <font color="#800080">As long as it lieth desolate it shall
rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</font></p>
    <p>Lev 26:43 <font color="#800080">The land also shall be left of
them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without
them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
because, even <b>because they despised my judgments, and because their
soul abhorred my statutes.</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is a warning for the end of time too:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Zep 1:14 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and
hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man
shall cry there bitterly.<br>
Zep 1:15 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a<font
 color="#800080"> day of wasteness and desolation</font>, a day of
darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</p>
    <p>Isa 13:9 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with
wrath and fierce anger, <font color="#800080">to lay the land desolate</font>:
and <font color="#800080">he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of
it.</font><br>
Isa 13:10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and
the moon shall not cause her light to shine.<br>
Isa 13:11 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked
for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</p>
    <p>Jer 4:23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and
void; and the heavens, and they had no light.<br>
Jer 4:24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the
hills moved lightly.<br>
Jer 4:25 I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the
heavens were fled.<br>
Jer 4:26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and
all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD,
and by his fierce anger.<br>
Jer 4:27 For thus hath the LORD said, <font color="#800080">The whole
land shall be desolate</font>; yet will I not make a full end.<br>
Jer 4:28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be
black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not
repent, neither will I turn back from it.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>The everlasting or perpetual covenant of Isaiah 24:5 is identified
in Exodus 31:16 as the Sabbath commandment of God's law. Changing that
commandment so as to break it, brings desolation according to Isaiah
24:6.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Daniel prophesies about the
abomination that makes desolate:</font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Dan 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the
most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and <font
 color="#800080"> think to change times and laws</font>: and they shall
be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:11 Yea, he [the little horn] magnified <i>himself</i>
even to the prince of the <b>host</b>, and by him the <b>daily</b> <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike>
was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.<br>
Dan 8:12 And an <b>host</b> was given <i>him</i> against the <b>daily</b>
    <strike><i> sacrifice</i></strike> by reason of transgression, and
it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.<br>
Dan 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
that certain saint which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>concerning</i>
the <b>daily</b> <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike>, and <font
 color="#800080">the transgression of desolation</font>, to give both
the sanctuary and the <b>host</b> to be trodden under foot?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The word <i>sacrifice</i> in the above passage is supplied by
the translators, it is not in the original text. </li>
    <li>Also the word translated daily [<a
 href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8548&amp;Version=KJV">H8548</a>
- tamiyd] can also have the meaning <u>perpetual</u>. (<a

    <li>The word host [<a
 href="http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H6635&amp;Version=KJV">H6635</a>
- tsaba'] can mean an <u>appointed time</u> (<a

10:1</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So the passage can be correctly translated as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:11 Yea, he [the little horn] magnified <i>himself</i>
even to the prince of the appointed time (Lord of the Sabbath, Matt
12:8, Mark 2:28, Luke 6:5), and by him the perpetual <i>covenant</i>
[Isa 24:5, the Sabbath] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary
was cast down.<br>
Dan 8:12 And an appointed time was given <i>him</i> against the
perpetual <i>covenant</i> [Isa 24:5, the Sabbath] by reason of
transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practiced, and prospered.<br>
Dan 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
that certain saint which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>concerning</i>
the perpetual <i>covenant </i>[Isa 24:5, the Sabbath], and <font
 color="#800080">the transgression of desolation [Sun worship, Deu.
17:2-5, Ezek. 8:15-16]</font>, to give both the sanctuary and the
appointed time to be trodden under foot? (see <a
 href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa.%2058:13;&amp;version=9;">Isa
58:13</a>)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So, the above translation change demonstrates a
distinct linking of the little horn thinking to "change times and laws"
in Dan 7:25, to the transgression / abomination that brings desolation
in Daniel 8, 9, 11, and 12:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 9:4 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my
confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, <font
 color="#800080"><u>keeping the covenant</u></font> and mercy to them
that love him, and to them that <font color="#800080"><u>keep his
commandments;</u></font><br>
...<br>
Dan 9:9 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we
have rebelled against him;<br>
Dan 9:10 <font color="#800080">Neither have we obeyed the voice of the
LORD our God, to walk in his laws</font>, which he set before us by his
servants the prophets.<br>
Dan 9:11 <font color="#800080">Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy
law</font>, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice;
therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in
the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.<br>
...<br>
Dan 9:24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
city, <font color="#800080">to finish the transgression</font>, and to
make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to
bring in <font color="#800080">everlasting righteousness</font>, and
to <font color="#800080">seal up the vision and prophecy</font>, and
to anoint the most Holy.<br>
Dan 9:25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the
Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street
shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.<br>
Dan 9:26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall
destroy the city and <font color="#800080">the sanctuary</font>; and
the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war <font
 color="#800080">desolations are determined</font>.<br>
Dan 9:27 And he shall <font color="#800080">confirm the covenant</font>
with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the
sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and <font color="#800080">for the
overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate</font>, even
until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the
desolate.</p>
    <p>Dan 11:22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown
from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the <u>prince of the
covenant</u>. (Lord of the Sabbath, Matt 12:8, Mark 2:28, Luke 6:5)<br>
...<br>
Dan 11:28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
heart shall be against the <u>holy covenant</u>; and he shall do
exploits, and return to his own land.<br>
Dan 11:29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.<br>
Dan 11:30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the <u>holy
covenant</u>: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have
intelligence with them that forsake the <u>holy covenant</u>.<br>
Dan 11:31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
sanctuary of strength (Zep 3:4), and shall take away the daily <i> <strike>sacrifice</strike></i>
(perpetual <i>covenant,</i> Isa 24:5, the Sabbath), and they shall
place <font color="#800080">the abomination that maketh desolate. </font>(...
they have done violence to the law <font face="Times New Roman">—</font>
Zep 3:4)<font color="#800080"><br>
    </font>Dan 11:32 And such as do wickedly against the <u>covenant</u>
shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God
(1 John 2:3) shall be strong, and do exploits.</p>
    <p>Dan 12:11 And from the time that the daily <strike><i>sacrifice</i></strike>
[perpetual <i>covenant,</i> Isa 24:5, the Sabbath] shall be taken
away, and <font color="#800080">the abomination that maketh desolate</font>
set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.</p>

Mat 12:12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
lawful to do well on the sabbath days.<br>

stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.<br>

  <p>The Jewish historian Josephus made the following observations
regarding Herod the Great placing a Roman eagle over a temple gate, and
the later siege of Jerusalem by Titus and the armies of Rome:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"...he was accused by Judas and Matthias; for the king had
erected over the great gate of the temple a large eagle, of great
value, and had dedicated it to the temple." - <i>The Antiquities Of
The Jews</i>, Book 17, Chapter 6, Section 2.</p>
    <p>"These lamented those that were put to death by Herod, because
they had cut down the golden eagle that had been over the gate of the
temple."<b> - </b><i> The Wars Of The Jews</i>, Book 2, Chapter 2,
Section 5.</p>
    <p>"1. NOW, as Titus was upon his march into the enemy's country,
the auxiliaries that were sent by the kings marched first, having all
the other auxiliaries with them; after whom followed those that were to
prepare the roads and measure out the camp; then came the commander's
baggage, and after that the other soldiers, who were completely armed
to support them; then came Titus himself, having with him another
select body; and then came the pikemen; after whom came the horse
belonging to that legion. All these came before the engines; and after
these engines came the tribunes and the leaders of the cohorts, with
their select bodies; after these came the ensigns, with the eagle; and
before those ensigns came the trumpeters belonging to them; <strong
 style="font-weight: 400;"><i>- The Wars of The Jews,</i>&nbsp;</strong>Book
V, Chapter II, Section 1.</p>
    <p>"Then came the ensigns encompassing the eagle, which is at the
head of every Roman legion, the king, and the strongest of all birds,
which seems to them a signal of dominion, and an omen that they shall
conquer all against whom they march..." - <i>The Wars Of The Jews</i>,
Book 3, Chapter 6, Section 2.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note this from Jeremiah:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 7:33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the
fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall
fray them away.<br>
Jer 7:34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from
the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for <font

  <p>So the symbolic <a

Roman ensigns</a>, a sign of Rome's power and authority, gathered
together around Jerusalem at the fall and desolation of apostate Israel
in 70 A.D., is symbolic imagery that repeats at the end of time with
the fall of the apostate church:</p>
  <blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left"><span class="text" field="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the first angel's message men are called upon to worship God, our
Creator, who made the world and all things that are therein. They have
paid homage to an institution of the Papacy, making of no effect the
law of Jehovah, but there is to be an increase of knowledge on this
subject. <span class="bc" field="bc">{2SM 106.<span class="pr"
 field="pr">1}</span></span></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wonderful connection is here seen between
the universe of heaven and this world. The things revealed to Daniel
were afterward complemented by the revelation made to John on the isle
of Patmos. These two books should be carefully perused. Twice Daniel
inquired, How long shall it be to the end of time? “And I heard, but I
understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these
things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up
and sealed till the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made
white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the
wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.... But go thou
thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at
the end of the days” [Daniel 12:8-10, 13]. {18MR 15.1}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Lion of the tribe of Judah who
unsealed the book and gave to John the revelation of what should be in
these last days. Daniel stood in his lot to bear his testimony, which
was sealed until the time of the end, when the first angel’s message
should be proclaimed to our world. These matters are of infinite
importance in these last days, but while “many shall be purified, and
made white, and tried,” “the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the
wicked shall understand.” {18MR 15.2}</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How true this is. Sin is the transgression of
the law of God, and those in the denominational churches who will not
accept the light in regard to the law of God will not understand the
proclamation of the first, second, and third angel’s messages. <u>The
book of Daniel is unsealed in the revelation to John, and carries us
forward to the last scenes of this earth’s history. </u>{18MR 15.3}</p>

The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we shall
be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and solitary places. As the
siege of Jerusalem by the Roman armies was the signal for flight to the
Judean Christians, so the assumption of power on the part of our nation
[the United States] in the decree enforcing the papal sabbath {the
ensign of papal Rome's power and authority} will be a warning to us. It
will then be time to leave the large cities, preparatory to leaving the
smaller ones for retired homes in secluded places among the mountains.
{Mar 180.1}<span class="pr" field="pr"> {5T 464-465}</span></p>
    <span class="text" field="text"> <span class="bc" field="bc"><span

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the decree enforcing the institution of
the papacy in violation of the law of God, our nation will disconnect
herself fully from righteousness. When Protestantism shall stretch her
hand across the gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she
shall reach over the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism, when,
under the influence of this threefold union, our country shall
repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Protestant and
republican government, and shall make provision for the propagation of
papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time has come
for the marvelous working of Satan and that the end is near. <span
 class="reference">{5T 451.1}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the approach of the Roman armies was a sign
to the disciples of the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so may this
apostasy be a sign to us that the limit of God's forbearance is
reached, that the measure of our nation's iniquity is full, and that
the angel of mercy is about to take her flight, never to return. The
people of God will then be plunged into those scenes of affliction and
distress which prophets have described as the time of Jacob's trouble.
The cries of the faithful, persecuted ones ascend to heaven. And as the
blood of Abel cried from the ground, there are voices also crying to
God from martyrs' graves, from the sepulchers of the sea, from mountain
caverns, from convent vaults: "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost
Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
{5T 451.2}</span></p>
    </span></span></span>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Saviour's prophecy concerning the
visitation of judgments upon Jerusalem is to have another fulfillment,
of which that terrible desolation was but a faint shadow. In the fate
of the chosen city we may behold the doom of a world that has rejected
God's mercy and trampled upon His law. Dark are the records of human
misery that earth has witnessed during its long centuries of crime. The
heart sickens, and the mind grows faint in contemplation. Terrible have
been the results of rejecting the authority of Heaven. But a scene yet
darker is presented in the revelations of the future.<span class="pr"

  <p>Ellen White speaks of two fulfillments of the abomination of
desolation, the first was the literal siege of Jerusalem in 68 A.D. but
the armies of Rome abandoned that siege, signaling Christians to flee
the city. When the armies of Rome returned in 70 A.D., the temple was
burned and Jerusalem destroyed, but because the Christians had
previously fled the city, none of them perished in the second siege.
This was the desolation referred to in Luke 21:20-21. It was the "type"
or initial fulfillment. The second or "antitype" fulfillment is the
answer to the question asked by the disciples with regard to the second
coming:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples
came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be?
and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. is but a "faint shadow" of
what will occur with the second or "antitype" fulfillment of the
abomination of desolation immediately prior to the second coming and
the end of the world. Once again Christians will be warned to flee the
cities for the mountains, and that sign will be the decree of a Sunday
law, which John the Revelator calls the mark of the beast. Like
Jerusalem, the cities of the world will suffer terrible destruction, as
the seven last plagues fall on the wicked with the close of probation.</p>

the following quote some 60 years later shows. </span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ellen White watched with growing anxiety and
distress the time-consuming controversy between leading brethren on an
unimportant point and one on which she repeatedly said she had received
no light [the daily]. On July 31, 1910, she could restrain herself no
longer. She took her pen and wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have words to speak to my brethren east
and west, north and south. I request that my writings shall not be used
as the leading argument to settle questions over which there is now so
much controversy. I entreat of Elders Haskell, Loughborough, Smith, and
others of our leading brethren, that they <u>make no reference to my
writings to sustain their views of the "daily."&nbsp; </u><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been presented to me that this is not a
subject of vital importance. I am instructed that our brethren are
making a mistake in magnifying the importance of the difference in the
views that are held. I cannot consent that <u>any</u> of my writings

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>I now ask that my ministering brethren shall not

no need for the controversy. Regarding this matter under present

  <p><span class="pr">So when she in 1850 said "</span>the Lord gave

either, because she was <u> never</u> shown the correct meaning by the
Lord, as MS 11 from 1910 clearly states. That is why in 1910 she
prohibited the use of her writings to support anyone's view of the
"daily". She had had no light on the matter, and so could not settle
the debate.</span></p>

as a holy day. Amid the prevailing error and superstition, many, even
of the true people of God, became so bewildered that while they
observed the Sabbath, they refrained from labor also on the Sunday. But
this did not satisfy the papal leaders. They demanded not only that
Sunday be hallowed, but that the Sabbath be profaned<sup>[+]</sup>; and

    <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord has a
controversy with his professed people in these last days. In this
controversy men in responsible positions will take a course directly
opposite to that pursued by Nehemiah. They will not only ignore and
despise the Sabbath themselves, but they will try to keep it from
others by burying it beneath the rubbish of custom and tradition. In
churches and in large gatherings in the open air, ministers will urge
upon the people the necessity of keeping the first day of the week.
There are calamities on sea and land: and these calamities will
increase, one disaster following close upon another; and the little
band of conscientious Sabbath-keepers will be pointed out as the ones
who are bringing the wrath of God upon the world by their disregard of
Sunday. <br>
...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The church of today has followed in the steps
of the Jews of old, who set aside the commandments of God for their own
traditions. <u>She has changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting
covenant</u>, and now, as then, pride, unbelief, and infidelity are the
result. Her true condition is set forth in these words from the song of
Moses: "They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
his children; they are a perverse and crooked generation. Do ye thus
requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father
that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?" {<a

  <p><span class="pr" field="pr">So Ellen White never specifically and
overtly defined the "daily". This was because the early Adventists were
intentionally not to know their proclamation of the Sabbath truth after
1844* was a fulfillment of the 2300 days prophecy. However the above
passage from <i>Great Controversy</i> that quotes Daniel 8:12 appears
to then expand on it and verse 13. Note the parallels that are now
evident between Daniel chapters 7 and 8:</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="pr">Dan 7:25 And he </span>[the little horn - v.8]<span

    <b>shall wear out the saints of the most High</b>, and think to <b>change
times and laws </b>[of the most High]: and they shall be given into
his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.<br>
Dan 7:26 <b>But the judgment shall sit</b>, and they shall take away
his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="pr">The points presented above are:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="pr">Blasphemy (great words)</span></li>
    <li><span class="pr">Persecution of faithful saints for 1260 years</span></li>
    <li><span class="pr">Little horn thinks to change the times
(appointed prophetic times, in particular the pre-advent judgment) of
God, and the laws of God (the Sabbath in particular).</span></li>
    <li><span class="pr">Judgment begins</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="pr">Note that <u>these exact same points</u> are
presented and explained in Daniel 8:9-14 when the alternate meanings of
  </span><i>tamiyd</i> and <i>tsaba'</i> are used:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which
waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
toward the pleasant land.<br>
Dan 8:10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and <b>it
cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped
upon them.</b><br>
Dan 8:11 Yea, he [the little horn] <b>magnified <i>himself</i> even
to the prince of the appointed time</b> (Lord of the Sabbath, Matt
12:8, Mark 2:28, Luke 6:5), and <b>by him the perpetual <i>covenant</i>
[Isa 24:5, the Sabbath] was taken away</b>, and <b>the place of his
sanctuary (which teaches the pre-advent judgment) was cast down.</b><br>
Dan 8:12 And an appointed time was given <i>him</i> against the
perpetual <i>covenant</i> [Isa 24:5, the Sabbath] by reason of
transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground [Psa. 119:142,
151-152, <i>Great Controversy,</i> 65.1]; and it practiced, and
prospered.<br>
Dan 8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
that certain saint which spake, How long <i>shall be</i> the vision <i>
concerning</i> <b>the perpetual <i>covenant </i>[Isa 24:5, the
Sabbath], and <font color="#800080">the transgression of desolation</font></b>,
    <b>to give both the sanctuary (judgment) and the appointed time to
be trodden under foot?</b> (see Zep 3:4, Isa. 58:13)<br>
Dan 8:14&nbsp; And he said unto me, <b>Unto two thousand and three
hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. [judgment begins
and the Sabbath is restored </b>- Isa. 58:12].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In clear terms, that then reads:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:11&nbsp; Yea, the papacy exalted himself even to the Lord,
and by the papacy the Lord's Sabbath was taken away, and the place of
the Lord's sanctuary was cast down.<br>
Dan 8:12&nbsp; And another appointed time was set forth by the papacy
against the Sabbath by the papacy's transgression, and so the papacy
cast down the law of God to the ground; and the papacy practiced, and
prospered.<br>
Dan 8:13&nbsp; Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said
unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision
concerning the Sabbath, this transgression of desolation that causes
both the Lord's sanctuary and Sabbath to be trodden under foot?<br>
Dan 8:14&nbsp; And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The study of the cleansing of sanctuary on the Day of Atonement
(judgment), inevitably led to the standard for judgment, the Ten
Commandments contained in the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of
Holies, the Sabbath commandment in particular. The Ark of the Covenant
contained, in addition to the two tables of the Ten Commandments, a pot
of manna (Exo. 16:33, Heb 9:4). What did the manna represent?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Deu 8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and
fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
know; <b>that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread
only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD
doth man live</b>. (Matt. 4:4, Luke 4:4)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God only provided the manna the first 6 days of the week:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but <b>on the seventh
day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For 40 years in the wilderness, the manna pointed out the Sabbath
day to the people of God. This is why a pot of manna was placed in the
Ark of the Covenant. It symbolizes the word of God calling attention to
the seventh day Sabbath in God's law! (Aaron's rod that budded, also
placed in the Ark, represents resurrection from the dead of our high
priest, Jesus Christ, and a true understanding of the state of the
dead.) </p>
  <p>That the "daily" can only now be seen to be the perpetual <i>covenant</i>
[Isa 24:5, the Sabbath], serves as a remarkable confirmation that the
Adventist restoration of the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement Sanctuary
teaching, also called the <a href="judgment.html">Investigative
Judgment</a>, were both providential, because both were <u>directly
prophesied in Daniel 8:13-14 and sealed until the time of the end (Dan
8:26 &amp; 12:4).</u><i>&nbsp; </i>John the Revelator saw this exact
same message <i>understood and proclaimed</i> to the world by the 3
angels of Revelation 14:6-12 after the 2300 years had passed in 1844. </p>

four corners of the earth (cf. Eze 7:2), holding the four winds of the
earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor
on any tree.<br>
Rev 7:2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four
angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,<br>

    </span> </span> </span></blockquote>
  <p align="left">Just as John the Baptist preceded the first coming of
Jesus, with the Elijah message, so too there is another message to be
proclaimed shortly before the second coming. It will be a message of
restoration of lost truths, that prepare the way of the Lord: </p>
  </span>
  <p><b><i>First Angel's Message repairs the breach of the little horn:</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
having the <b><u>everlasting gospel</u></b> to preach unto them that
dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people,<br>
Rev 14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b> <u>(1) for the hour of his judgment is come: </u></b></li>
      <li> <b> <u>(2) and worship him that made heaven, and earth,
and the sea, and the fountains of waters (Exo. 20:8-11). </u></b> </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These two points are the exact same two points that the little
horn thinks to change in Daniel 7:25, Dan 8:11-14, Dan 11:30-31, Dan
12: 11. The proclamation of the first angel's message exposes the work
of the little horn to obscure the everlasting gospel as it relates to
judgment and the seventh day Sabbath, it repairs the breach in the Law
of God, trampled by the little horn.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 58:12 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old
waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;
and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of
paths to dwell in.<br>
Isa 58:13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of
the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,
nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:<br>
Isa 58:14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause
thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the
heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b><i>Second Angel's Message</i></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is
fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b><i>Third Angel's Message - Mark of the Beast</i></b></p>
  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
  </span>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud
voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark
in his forehead, or in his hand,<br>
Rev 14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he
shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy
angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:<br>
Rev 14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and
ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and
his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.<br>
Rev 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The first angel's message proclaims the warning that God's
judgment is underway and calls mankind to worship Him as the creator by
referring to the Sabbath commandment. The second angel's message
declares that Babylon is found guilty in the judgment, and the third
angel's message describes the punishment those in Babylon will receive
for having the mark of the beast. Note that the saints of verse 12, who
persevere and heed the first angel's message, do not receive the mark
of the beast!</p>
  <p>This characteristic of commandment keeping by the saints is also
mentioned in Revelation 12:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed [Dan. 11:44], <u>which keep the
commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</u></p>
    <p>Rev 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said
unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy
brethren that have the testimony of Jesus:<u> worship God: for the
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</u></p>
    <p>Rev 22:9 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren <u>the prophets</u>, and of them
which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those who have the seal of God keep the Ten Commandments and have
a true understanding of Bible prophecy. Daniel 7:25 referred to these
as the times [prophetic] and laws [of the most High]. Here are the
evident parallels in Daniel and Revelation:</p>

  <p><u><b>THE SEAL OF GOD</b></u></p>
  <p>If we also now apply the refined definitions of "times and laws"
of Dan 7:25 provided to us by Revelation 12:17, 14:7 and 19:10, and
read them into Isaiah 8, notice the result:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:16 Bind up the testimony (of Jesus, the spirit of
prophecy), <font color="#800080"><b>seal</b></font> the law (7th day
Sabbath) among my disciples.<br>
...<br>
Isa 8:20 To the law (7th day Sabbath) and to the testimony (2300 day
prophecy / pre-advent judgment): if they speak not according to this
word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In conjunction with Exodus 31:16-17, this clearly confirms the 7th
day Sabbath to be the sign or seal of God, the perpetual <i>covenant</i>
of Daniel 8.</p>
