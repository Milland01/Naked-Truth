<title>Father Enright on the Sunday</title>

<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F<font size="2">OR</font> the benefit of 
  those who favor Sunday laws, and especially those who boast of the indorsement 
  of Cardinal Gibbons, and the co-operation of the Catholic Church, we print the 
  following  statement of Father Enright, lately made, as to the authority for 
  Sunday laws:— <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My brethren, look about you upon the various wrangling sects 
  and denominations. Show me one that claims, or possesses the power to make 
  laws binding on the conscience. There's but one on the
  face of the earth—the Catholic Church—that  has the power to make laws binding 
  upon the conscience, binding before God, binding under pain of hell fire. Take 
  for instance the day we celebrate—Sunday. What right have the Protestant 
  churches to observe that, day? None whatever. You say it is to obey the 
  commandment, 'Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.' But Sunday is not the 
  Sabbath according to the Bible and the record of time. Every one knows that 
  Sunday is the first day of the week, while Saturday is the seventh day and the 
  Sabbath, the day consecrated as a day of rest. It is so recognized in all 
  civilized nations. I have repeatedly offered $1000 to any one who will furnish 
  any proof from the Bible that Sunday is the day we are bound to keep, and no 
  one has called for the money. If any person in this town will show me any 
  scripture for it I will, tomorrow evening, publicly acknowledge it and thank 
  him for it. It was the holy Catholic Church that changed the day of rest from 
  Saturday to Sunday, the first day of the week. And it not only compelled all 
  to keep Sunday, but at the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364, anathematized those 
  who kept the Sabbath arid urged all persons to labor on the seventh day under 
  the penalty of anathema.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Which church does the whole civilized world obey? 
  Protestants call us every horrible name they can think of—antichrist, the 
  scarlet-colored beast, Babylon, etc., and at the same time profess great
  reverence for the Bible, and yet by their solemn act of keeping Sunday they 
  acknowledge the power of the Catholic Church. The Bible says, 'Remember the 
  Sabbath day, to keep it holy,' but the Catholic Church says, 'No, keep the 
  first day of the week,' and the whole world bows in obedience.&quot; —<i> The 
  Industrial American, Harlan, Iowa, December</i> 19, 1889. <br>
