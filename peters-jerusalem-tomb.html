  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; While visiting a friend in Switzerland, I 
  heard of what seemed to me, one of the greatest discoveries since the time of 
  Christ—that Peter was buried in Jerusalem and not in Rome. The source of this 
  rumor, written in Italian, was not clear; it left considerable room for doubt 
  or rather wonder. Rome was the place where I could investigate the matter, and 
  if such proved encouraging, a trip to Jerusalem might be necessary in order to 
  gather valuable first hand information on the subject. I therefore went to 
  Rome. After talking to many priests and investigating various sources of 
  information, I finally was greatly rewarded by learning where I could buy the 
  only known book on the subject, which was also written in Italian. It is 
  called, <a href="#Scans">&quot;Gli Scavi del Dominus Flevit&quot;</a>, printed in 1958 
  at the Tipografia del PP. Francescani, in Jerusalem. It was written by P. B. 
  Bagatti and J. T. Milik, both Roman Catholic priests. The story of the 
  discovery was there, but it seemed to be purposely hidden for much was 
  lacking. I consequently determined to go to Jerusalem to see for myself, if 
  possible, that which appeared to be almost unbelievable, especially since it 
  came from priests, who naturally because of the existing tradition that Peter 
  was buried in Rome, would be the last ones to welcome such a discovery or to 
  bring it to the attention of the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Jerusalem I spoke to many Franciscan priests who all 
  read, finally, though reluctantly, that the bones of Simon Bar Jona (St. 
  Peter) were found in Jerusalem, on the Franciscan monastery site called, &quot;Dominus 
  Flevit&quot; (where Jesus was supposed to have wept over [pg. 4] Jerusalem), on the Mount 
  of Olives. The pictures show the story. The first show an excavation where the 
  names of Christian Biblical characters were found on the ossuaries (bone 
  boxes). The names of Mary and Martha were found on one box and right next to 
  it was one with the name of Lazarus, their brother. Other names of early 
  Christians were found on other boxes. Of greatest interest, however, was that 
  which was found within twelve feet from the place where the remains of Mary, 
  Martha and Lazarus were found—the remains of St. Peter. They were found in an 
  ossuary, on the outside of which was clearly and beautifully written in 
  Aramaic, &quot;Simon Bar Jona&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
  
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I talked to a Yale professor, who is an archaeologist, and 
  was director of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem. He told 
  me that it would be very improbable that a name with three words, and one so 
  complete, could refer to any other than St. Peter. </p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="aramaic-hebrew.gif" width="412" height="231"></p>
  <p align="justify">But what makes the possibility of error more remote is that 
  the remains were found in a Christian burial ground, and more yet, of the 
  first century, the very time in which Peter lived. In fact, I have a letter 
  from a noted scientist stating that he can tell by the writing that it was 
  written just before the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 A.D.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I talked to priest Milik, the co-writer of this Italian 
  book, in the presence of my friend, a Christian Arab, Mr. S. J. Mattar, who 
  now is the warden of the Garden Tomb, where Jesus was buried and rose again. 
  This priest, Milik, admitted that he knew that the bones of St. Peter are not 
  in Rome. I was very much surprised that he would admit that, so to confirm his 
  admittance, I said, to which he also agreed, &quot;There is a hundred times more 
  evidence that Peter was buried in Jerusalem than in Rome.&quot; This was something 
  of an understatement, for he knew as I know that there is absolutely no 
  evidence at all that Peter was buried in Rome. I have spoken on the subject to many Franciscan priests who 
  either were or had been in Jerusalem, and they all agree that the tomb and 
  remains of St. Peter are in Jerusalem. There was just one exception which is 
  interesting and which only proves the point. The Franciscan priest, Augusto 
  Spykerman, who was in charge of the semi-private museum inside the walls of 
  old Jerusalem, by the site of the Franciscan Church of the Flagellation, was 
  that exception. When I asked to see the museum, he showed it to the three of 
  us, Mr. Mattar, who in addition to being warden of the Tomb of Christ, had 
  been the manager of an English bank in Jerusalem, a. professional photographer 
  and myself. But he told us nothing of the discovery. I knew that the evidence 
  of Peter’s burial was there, for priests had told me that relics from the 
  Christian burial ground were preserved within this museum. People who lived in 
  Jerusalem all their lives and official guides who are supposed to know every 
  inch of the city, however, knew nothing of this [pg 5] discovery, so well was it 
  withheld from the public. I had asked an elderly official guide where the tomb 
  of St. Peter was. He responded in a very profound and majestic tone of voice, 
  &quot;The Tomb of St. Peter has never been found in Jerusalem.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; I said, &quot;but 
  I have seen the burial place of Peter with my own eyes.&quot; He turned on me with 
  a fierceness that is so common among Arabs. &quot;What,&quot; he replied, &quot;you a 
  foreigner mean to tell me that you know where the tomb of St. Peter is when I 
  have been an official guide for thirty-five years and know every inch of 
  ground in Jerusalem?&quot; I was afraid that he would jump at my throat. I managed 
  to calm him as I said, &quot;But sir, here are the pictures and you can see the 
  ossuary, among others, with Peter’s name in Aramaic. You can also see this for 
  yourself on the Mount of Olives on the Franciscan Convent site called, &quot;Dominus Flevit&quot;. When I finished he slowly turned away in stunned amazement. A person 
  who has seen this Christian burial ground and knows the circumstances 
  surrounding the case could never doubt that this truly is the burial place of 
  St. Peter and of other Christians. I, too, walked around in a dreamy amazement 
  for about a week for I could hardly believe what I had seen and heard. Since 
  the circulation of this article, they do not allow anyone to see this burial 
  place. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before things had gone very far, I had been quite 
  discouraged for I could get no information from the many priests with whom I 
  had talked. However, I continued questioning priests wherever I would find 
  them. Finally one priest dropped some information. With that knowledge I 
  approached another priest who warily asked me where I had acquired that 
  information. I told him that a priest had told me. Then he admitted the point 
  and dropped a little more information. It went on like that for some time 
  until I got the whole picture, and I was finally directed to where I could see 
  the evidence for myself. To get the story, it made me feel as though I had a 
  bull by the tail and were trying to pull him through a key hole. But when I 
  had gathered all the facts in the case, the priests could not deny the 
  discovery of the tomb, but even confirmed it, though reluctantly. In fact, I 
  have the statement from a Spanish priest on the Mount of Olives on a tape 
  recorder, to that effect. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But here we were talking to this Franciscan priest in 
  charge of the museum, asking him questions which he tried to evade but could 
  not because of the information I had already gathered from the many priests 
  with whom I had spoken. Finally after the pictures of the evidence were taken, 
  which was nothing short of a miracle that he allowed us to do so, I 
  complimented him on the marvelous discovery of the tomb of St. Peter in 
  Jerusalem that the Franciscans had made. He  was clearly nervous as he said, 
  &quot;Oh no, the tomb of St. Peter is in Rome.&quot; But as he said that, his voice 
  faltered, a fact which even my [pg. 6] friend, Mr. Mattar, had noticed. Then I looked 
  him squarely in the eyes and firmly said, &quot;No, the tomb of St. Peter is in 
  Jerusalem.&quot; He looked at me like a guilty school boy and held his peace. He 
  was, no doubt, placed there to hide the facts, but his actions and words, 
  spoke more convincingly about the discovery than those priests who finally 
  admitted the truth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also spoke to a Franciscan priest in authority at the 
  priest’s printing plant within the walls of old Jerusalem, where their book on 
  the subject was printed. He also admitted that the tomb of St. Peter is in 
  Jerusalem. Then when I visited the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, I 
  encountered a Franciscan monk. After telling him what I thought of the 
  wonderful discovery the Franciscans had made, I asked him plainly, &quot;Do you 
  folks really believe that those are the remains of St. Peter?&quot; He responded, 
  &quot;Yes we do, we have no choice in the matter. The clear evidence is there.&quot; I 
  did not doubt the evidence, but what surprised me was that these priests and 
  monks believed that which was against their own religion and on top of that, 
  to admit it to others was something out of this world. Usually a Catholic, 
  either because he is brainwashed or stubbornly doesn’t want to see anything 
  only that which he has been taught, will not allow himself to believe anything 
  against his religion, much less to admit it to others. But there is a growing, 
  healthy attitude among many Catholics, to &quot;prove all things, hold fast to that 
  which is good&quot; as the Master admonished us all. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I asked, &quot;Does Father Bagatti (co-writer of the book 
  in Italian on the subject, and archaeologist) really believe that those are 
  the bones of St. Peter?&quot; <i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&quot;Yes, he does,&quot; was the reply.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I asked, 
  &quot;But what does the Pope think of all this?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was a thousand dollar 
  question and he gave me a million dollar answer. <i><br>
&nbsp; </i>&nbsp; &quot;Well,&quot; he 
  confidentially answered in a hushed voice, &quot;Father Bagatti told me personally 
  that three years ago he went to the Pope (Pius XII) in Rome and showed him the 
  evidence and the Pope said to him, ‘Well, we will have to make some changes, 
  but for the time being, keep this thing quiet’.&quot; In awe I 
  asked also in a subdued voice, &quot;So the Pope really believes that those are the 
  bones of St. Peter?&quot; <i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>&quot;Yes,&quot; was his answer. &quot;The documentary evidence 
  is there, he could not help but believe.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I visited various renowned archaeologists on the subject. 
  Dr. Albright, of the John Hopkins University in Baltimore, told me that he 
  personally knew priest Bagatti and that he was a very competent archaeologist. 
  I also spoke with Dr. Nelson Gluek, archaeologist and [pg. 7] president of the Hebrew 
  Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. I showed him the pictures found in this 
  article, but being with him for only a few minutes I therefore could not show 
  him the wealth of material that you have before you in this article. However, 
  he quickly recognized the Aramaic words to be &quot;Simon Bar Jona&quot;. (Aramaic is 
  very similar to Hebrew). I asked him if he would write a statement to that 
  effect. He said to do so would cast a reflection on the competency of the 
  priest J. T. Milik, who he knew to be a very able scientist. But he said that 
  he would write a note. I quote, &quot;I regard Father J. T. Milik as a first class scholar 
    in the Semitic field.&quot; He added, &quot;I do not consider that names on ossuaries 
    are conclusive evidence that they are those of the Apostles.&quot; </p>
  <p align="center">Nelson 
    Glueck </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quote this letter of Dr. Glueck because it shows that 
  priest Milik is a competent archaeologist. As I have mentioned, I was only 
  able to be with him for a few minutes and was not able to show him but a very 
  small part of the evidence. Anyone, including myself, would readily agree with 
  Dr. Glueck that if only the name Simon Bar Jona on the ossuary was all the 
  evidence that was available it would not be conclusive evidence that it was of 
  the Apostle Peter, though it would certainly be a strong indication. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story 
  of the cave and the ossuaries and the regular cemetery just outside of the 
  Convent site is this: It was a Roman custom that when a person had died and 
  after about ten years when the body had decomposed, the grave would be opened. 
  The bones would be placed in a small ossuary with the name of the person 
  carefully written on the outside front. These ossuaries would then be placed 
  in a cave as in the case of this Christian burial ground and thus making room 
  for others. But this cave or burial place where the ossuaries were found and 
  which was created and brought about through the natural and disinterested 
  sequence of events, without any reason to change facts or circumstances, was a 
  greater testimony than if there were a witness recorded, stating that Peter 
  was buried there. And yet, even that is unmistakenly recorded in the three 
  words in Aramaic of the ossuary, Simon Bar Jona. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein, lies the greatest 
  proof that Peter never was a Pope, and never was in Rome, for if he had been, 
  it would have certainly been proclaimed in the New Testament. History, 
  likewise, would not have been silent on the subject, as they were not silent 
  in the case of the Apostle Paul. Even the Catholic history would have claimed 
  the above as a fact and not as fickle tradition. To omit Peter as being Pope 
  and in [pg. 8] </p>

  <p align="center">[pg. 12]</p>
  <p align="justify">Rome (and the Papacy) would be like omitting the Law of Moses or the 
  Prophets or the Acts of the Apostles from the Bible. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Glueck, being Jewish, and having been to Jerusalem, no 
  doubt, is fully aware of the fact that for centuries the Catholic Church 
  bought up what were thought to be holy sites, some of which did not stand up 
  to Biblical description. For instance, the priests say that the tomb of Jesus 
  is within the walls of the old Jerusalem, in a hole in the ground; whereas, 
  the Bible says that the tomb where Jesus was laid was hewn out of rock and a 
  stone was rolled in front and not on top of it. The Garden Tomb at the foot of 
  Golgotha, outside the walls of old Jerusalem, meets the Biblical description 
  perfectly. In fact, all those who were hated by the Jewish leaders, as Jesus 
  was, could never have been allowed to be buried within the gates of the Holy 
  City. The tomb where Jesus lay was made for Joseph of Arimathaea. His family 
  were all stout and short of stature. In this burial place you can see to this 
  day where someone had carved deeper into the wall to make room for Jesus who 
  was said to be about six feet tall. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Pope Pius XII declared the Assumption of Mary to be an 
  article of faith in 1950, the Catholic Church in Jerusalem then quickly sold 
  the tomb of Mary to the Armenian Church. Ex-priest Lavallo told me personally 
  that there is another tomb of St. Mary in Ephesus. But the tomb of St. Peter 
  is altogether different for they would rather that it never existed, and to 
  buy or sell such a site would be out of the question. It fell upon them in 
  this manner, as I was told by a Franciscan monk of the monastery of &quot;Dominus 
  Flevit&quot;. One of their members was spading the ground on this site in 1953, 
  when his shovel fell through. Excavation was started and there, a large 
  underground Christian burial ground was uncovered. The initial of Christ in 
  Greek was written there which would never have been found in a Jewish, Arab or 
  pagan cemetery. By the structure of the writings, it was established by 
  scientists that they were of the days just before the destruction of Jerusalem 
  by Titus in 70 A.D. On the ossuaries were found many names of the Christian of 
  the early Church. It was prophesied in the Bible that Jesus would stand on the 
  Mount of Olives at His return to earth. You can see then, how the Christians 
  would be inclined to have their burial ground on the Mount, for here also, had 
  been a favorite meeting place of Jesus and His disciples.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the cemetery, 
  nothing was found (as also in the Catacombs in Rome) which resemble Arab, 
  Jewish, Catholic or pagan practices. Dr. Glueck, being Jewish, is not fully 
  aware, no doubt, that such a discovery is very embarrassing since it 
  undermines the very foundation of the Roman Catholic Church. Since Peter did 
  not live in Rome and therefore was not martyred or buried there, it naturally 
  follows that he [pg. 13] was not their first Pope.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Catholic Church says that Peter was Pope in Rome from 
  41 to 66 A.D., a period of twenty-five years, but the Bible shows a different 
  story. The book of the Acts of the Apostles (in either the Catholic or 
  Protestant Bible) records the following: Peter was preaching the Gospel to the 
  circumcision (the Jews) in Caesarea and Joppa in Palestine, ministering unto 
  the household of Cornelius, which is a distance of 1,800 miles from Rome (Acts 
  10:23, 24). Soon after, about the year 44 A.D. (Acts 12), Peter was cast into 
  prison in Jerusalem by Herod, but he was released by an angel. From 46 to 52 
  A.D., we read in the 13th chapter that he was in Jerusalem preaching the 
  difference between Law and Grace. Saul was converted in 34 A.D. and became 
  Paul the Apostle (Acts 9). Paul tells us that three years after his conversion 
  in 37 A.D., he &quot;went up to Jerusalem to see Peter&quot; (Galatians 1:18), and in 51 
  A.D., fourteen years later, he again went up to Jerusalem (Gal. 2:1, 8), Peter 
  being mentioned. Soon after that he met Peter in Antioch, and as Paul says, 
  &quot;Withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed,&quot; Gal. 2:11. The 
  evidence is abundant, the truth is clear from the Scriptures which have never 
  failed. It would be breathtaking to read of the boldness of Paul in dealing 
  with Peter. Very few, if any, have withstood a Pope and lived (except in these 
  days when everybody seems to withstand him). If Peter were Pope it would have 
  been no different. Paul does not only withstand Peter but rebukes him and 
  blames him of being at fault. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This reminds me of my visit to the St. Angelo Castle in 
  Rome. This castle, which is a very strong fortress, is connected with the 
  Vatican by a high arched viaduct of about a mile in length over which popes 
  have fled in time of danger. The Roman Catholic guide showed me a prison room 
  which had a small air-tight chamber in it. He told me that a Cardinal who had 
  contended with a pope on doctrine was thrown into this air-tight chamber for 
  nearly two hours until he almost smothered to death. He then was led to the 
  guillotine a few feet away and his head was cut off. Another thing remained 
  with me forcibly. The guide showed me through the apartments of the various 
  popes who had taken refuge there. In each case he also showed me the apartment 
  of the mistresses of each of the popes. I was amazed that he made no attempt 
  to hide anything. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked him &quot;Are you not a Catholic?&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He humbly answered,
  &quot;Oh yes, I am a Catholic, but I am ashamed of the history of many of the 
  popes, but I trust that our modern popes are better.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then asked him, 
  &quot;Surely you are aware of the affair between Pope Pius XII and his 
  housekeeper?&quot; Many in Rome say that she ran [pg. 14] the affairs of the Pope and the 
  Vatican as well. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hung his head in shame and sadly said, &quot;Yes, I know.&quot;
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this explains why the Catholic Church has been so 
  careful to keep this discovery unknown. They were successful in doing just 
  that from 1953, when it was discovered by the Franciscans on their own convent 
  site, until 1959. Having succeeded for so long in keeping &quot;this thing quiet,&quot; 
  as the Pope had admonished, they were off guard when a fellow at that time 
  came along who appeared harmless but persistent. Little did they know that 
  this fellow would publish the news everywhere. Their position in the world is 
  shaky enough without this discovery becoming generally known. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have mentioned, I had a very agreeable talk with 
  priest Milik, but I did not have the opportunity to see priest Bagatti while 
  in Jerusalem. I wrote to him, however, on March 15, 1960, as follows: &quot;I have 
  spoken with a number of Franciscan priests and monks and they have told me 
  about you and the book of which you are a co-writer. I had hoped to see you 
  and to compliment you on such a great discovery, but time would not permit. 
  Having heard so much about you and that you are an archaeologist (with the 
  evidence in hand), I was convinced, with you, concerning the ancient burial 
  ground that the remains found in the ossuary with the name on it, ‘Simon Bar 
  Jona’, written in Aramaic, were those of St. Peter.&quot; It is remarkable that in 
  his reply he did not contradict my statement, which he certainly would have 
  done if he honestly could have done so. &quot;I was very much convinced with you  
  ... that the remains found in the ossuary ... were those of St. Peter.&quot; This 
  confirms the talk I had with the Franciscan monk in Bethlehem and the story he 
  told me of Priest Bagatti’s going to the Pope with the evidence concerning the 
  bones of St. Peter in Jerusalem. In his letter one can see that he is careful 
  because of the Pope’s admonition to keep this discovery quiet. He therefore 
  wrote me that he leaves the whole explanation of the Aramaic words, &quot;Simon Bar 
  Jona&quot;, to priest Milik. This is a familiar way of getting out of a similar 
  situation. In priest Bagatti’s letter one can see that he is in a difficult 
  position. He cannot go against what he had written in 1953, at the time of the 
  discovery of this Christian-Jewish burial ground, nor what he had said to the 
  Franciscan monk about his visit to the Pope. However, he does raise a question 
  which helps him to get out of the situation without altogether contradicting 
  himself and at the same time putting a smoke screen around the truth. He 
  wrote, &quot;Supposing that it is ‘Jona’ (on the ossuary) as I 
    believe, it may be some other relative of St. Peter, because names were 
    passed on from family to family. To be able to propose the identification of 
    it with St. Peter would go against a long tradition, which has its own 
    value. Anyway, another volume will come [pg. 15] soon that will demonstrate that the 
    cemetery was Christian and of the first century to the second century A.D. </p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have shown, after the admonition of the Pope to &quot;keep 
  this thing quiet,&quot; priest Bagatti leaves the interpretation of the whole 
  matter to priest Milik who offers several suggestions but in the end declares 
  that the original statement of priest Bagatti may be true—that the inscription 
  and the remains were of St. Peter. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also very interesting and highly 
  significant that priest Bagatti, in his attempt to neutralize his original 
  statement and the consternation the discovery had and would have if it were 
  generally known, says in reference to the name Simon Bar Jona (St. Peter), &quot;It 
  may be some other relative of St. Peter, because names were passed on from 
  generation to generation.&quot; In other words he says that Peter’s name, Simon Bar 
  Jona, could have been given him from a relative of the same name of 
  generations before him, or, could belong to a relative generations after St. 
  Peter. Both speculations are beyond the realm of the possible. First of all, 
  it could not refer to a relative before St. Peter for the Christian burial 
  ground could only have come into being after Jesus began. His public ministry 
  and had converts; and therefore, could not belong to a relative before Peter’s 
  time, since only those who were converted through Christ’s ministry were 
  buried there. Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 70 A.D. and left it desolate. 
  Therefore, it is impossible that the inscription could refer to a relative 
  after Peter’s time. One encyclopedia explains the destruction in these words, 
  ‘‘With this event the history of ancient Jerusalem came to a close, for it was 
  left desolate and it’s inhabitants were scattered abroad.&quot; From all evidence, 
  Peter was about fifty years old when Jesus called him to be an Apostle, and he 
  died around the age of 82, or about the year 62 A.D. Since by these figures 
  there was only eight years left from the time of Peter’s death until the 
  destruction of Jerusalem, it was then impossible that the inscription and 
  remains belonged to generations after Peter. In those days names were passed 
  on to another only after a lapse of many years. But let us say that 
  immediately after the death of St. Peter, a baby was christened, &quot;Simon Bar 
  Jona&quot;, the inscription still could not have been of this baby for the remains 
  were of an adult and not of a child of eight years who had died just before 
  the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., at which time &quot;the history of ancient 
  Jerusalem came to a close, for it was left desolate and its inhabitants were 
  scattered abroad.&quot; [pg. 16]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This ancient Christian burial ground shows that Peter died 
  and was buried in Jerusalem, which is easily understandable since neither 
  history nor the Bible tells of Peter’s having been in Rome. To make matters 
  more clear, the Bible tells us that Peter was the Apostle to the Jews. It was 
  Paul who was the Apostle to the Gentiles, and both history and the Bible tells 
  of his being in Rome. No wonder that the Roman Catholic Bishop, Strossmayer, 
  in his great speech against papal infallibility before the Pope and the 
  Council of 1870 said, &quot;Scaliger, one of the most learned men, has not 
  hesitated to say that St. Peter’s episcopate and residence in Rome ought to be 
  classed with ridiculous legends.&quot; Eusebius, one of the most learned men of his time, wrote 
  the Church history up to the year 325 A.D. He said that Peter never was in 
  Rome. This Church history was translated by Jerome from the original Greek, 
  but in his translation he added a fantastic story of Peter’s residence in 
  Rome. This was a common practice in trying to create credence in their 
  doctrines, using false statements, false letters and falsified history. This 
  is another reason why we cannot rely on tradition, but only on the infallible 
  Word of God. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secrecy surrounding this case is amazing, and yet 
  understandable, since Catholics largely base their faith on the assumption 
  that Peter was their first Pope and that he was martyred and buried there. But 
  I am somewhat of the opinion that the Franciscan priests, those who are 
  honest, would be glad to see the truth proclaimed, even if it displeased those 
  who are over them. While visiting with priest Milik, I told him of the highly 
  educated priest with whom I had spoken just before going from Rome to 
  Jerusalem. He admitted to me that the remains of Peter are not in the tomb of 
  St. Peter in the Vatican. I asked him what had happened to them? He responded, 
  &quot;We don’t know, but we think that the Saracens stole them away.&quot; First of all, 
  the Saracens never got to Rome, but even if they had, what would they want 
  with the bones of Peter? But they never got to Rome, so there it ends. We had 
  a good laugh together, but more so when I told him of my discussion with a 
  brilliant American priest in Rome. I asked this American priest if he knew 
  that the bones of Peter were not in the &quot;Tomb of St. Peter&quot; in the Vatican. He 
  admitted that they were not there. However, he said that a good friend of his, 
  an archaeologist, had been excavating under St. Peter’s Basilica for the bones 
  of St. Peter for a number of years and five years ago he found them. Now a man 
  can be identified by his fingerprints, but never by his bones. So I asked him 
  how he knew they were the bones of St. Peter? He hesitated and tried to change 
  the subject, but on my insistence he finally explained that they had taken the 
  bones to a chemist, and they were analyzed and it was judged that the bones 
  were of a man who had died at about the age [pg. 17] of sixty-five; therefore, they 
  must be Peter’s. How ridiculous can people be? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark you, all the priests agree that the Vatican and St. 
  Peter’s were built over a pagan cemetery. This was a very appropriate place 
  for them to build since, as even Cardinal Newman admitted, there are many 
  pagan practices in the Roman Catholic Church. You realize surely, that 
  Christians would never bury their dead in a pagan cemetery, and you may be 
  very sure that pagans would never allow a Christian to be buried in their 
  cemetery. So, even if Peter died in Rome, which is out of the question, surely 
  the pagan cemetery under St. Peter’s Basilica would be the last place in which 
  he would have been buried. Also, Peter from every indication, lived to be over 
  80 and not 65 years old. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pope was right, going back to the early Christian 
  burial ground, they must make changes and many of them and fundamental ones at 
  that. But I am afraid that the Pope’s (Pius XII) admittance of the discovery 
  on Bagatti’s presentation of the documentary evidence was to satisfy Bagatti 
  but at the same time admonishing him to keep the information quiet, hoping 
  that the truth of the discovery would die out. But they have said that after 
  all these years of excavation under the Vatican, they have discovered Greek 
  words which read, &quot;Peter is buried here,&quot; and it gives the date 160 A.D. First 
  of all, the very structure of the sentence immediately gives one the 
  impression that either quite recently or long ago, someone put the sign there 
  hoping that it would be taken as authentic in order to establish that which 
  then, and even now, has never been proven. Then there is a discrepancy in the 
  date, for Peter was martyred around the year 62 A.D. and not 160 A.D. Thirdly, 
  why is it that they mention nothing about finding bones under or around the 
  sign? While visiting the Catacombs, one sees a few things which are not 
  becoming to Christians, but which tend to indicate that the Christians had 
  some pagan practices, similar to those of Rome today. Nothing is said about 
  them and only after persistent questioning will the Roman Catholic priest, who 
  acts as guide, tell you that those things, images, etc., were placed there 
  centuries after the early Christian era. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1950, just a few years prior to the discovery of the 
  Christian burial ground in Jerusalem, the Pope made the strange declaration 
  that the bones of St. Peter were found under St. Peter’s in Rome. Strange it 
  was, for since beginning to build the church in 1450 (finished in 1626) they 
  erected, St. Peter’s Tomb (?) under the large dome and Bernini's serpentine 
  columns. Since then multiplied millions were thereby deceived into believing 
  that the remains of St. Peter were there, which the hierarchy had all along 
  known was not true, as is proven by the late Pope’s declaration. The following 
  was published in the Newsweek of [pg. 18] July 1, 1957: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It was in 1950 that Pope Pius XII in his Christmas 
    message announced that the tomb of St. Peter had indeed been found, as 
    tradition held, beneath the immense dome of the Cathedral (there was, 
    however, no evidence that the bones uncovered there belonged to the body of 
    the martyr).&quot; The parentheses are Newsweek’s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make an announcement of such importance when there is 
  absolutely &quot;no evidence&quot; is rather ridiculous as is also brought out in the 
  Time Magazine of October 28, 1957 (as in above, we quote the article word for 
  word). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;A thorough account in English of the discoveries beneath 
  St. Peter’s is now available ... by British archaeologists Jocelyn Toynbee and 
  John Ward Perkins. The authors were not members of the excavating team, but 
  scholars Toynbee (a Roman Catholic) and Perkins (an Anglican) poured over the 
  official Vatican reports painstakingly examined the diggings. Their careful 
  independent conclusions fall short of the Pope’s flat statement.&quot; (The Pope’s 
  statement that the remains of St. Peter were found under St. Peter’s in Rome). 
  The excavation under St. Peter’s for the remains of St. Peter is still going 
  on secretly, in spite of the Pope’s declaration of 1950. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in 1965, an archaeologist at Rome University, Prof. 
  Margherita Guarducci, tells of a new set of bones belonging to Peter. The 
  story was fantastic but lacked common sense and even bordered on the 
  infantile—but a drowning man will grab for a straw and a straw it was to many. 
  But the Palo Alto Times (California), May 9, 1967, came out with an article on 
  the subject, and I quote, &quot;Other experts, among them Msgr. Joseph Ruysschaert, 
  vice prefect of the Vatican Library are not convinced by Miss Guarducci’s 
  evidence. ‘There are too many unknowns,’ he told reporters on a recent tour of 
  the Vatican grottoes, ‘There is no continuous tracing of the bones. We lack 
  historical proof. They could be anyone’s bones.’ The Vatican would seem to be 
  on the monsignor's side because so far it has taken no steps to officially 
  recognize the bones as St. Peter’s,&quot; continues the article. [A similar 
  article in the <i>
  <a href="../www.biblelight.info/Sources/Valley-Independent-Monessen-Pa-May-10-67.gif">
  Valley Independent</a></i>, Monessen Pa., May 10, 1967]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intelligent priest of whom I have mentioned said that 
  Peter’s bones were found and he was a man who died of about 62 years of age, 
  the tests indicated. Pope Pius XII declared these bones were the bones of St. 
  Peter, in his Christmas message of 1950. These were the same as claimed by 
  Newsweek, &quot;there was, however, no evidence that the bones uncovered there 
  belonged to the body of the martyr (Peter),&quot; as well as the above doubtful 
  statements of the archaeologists working on the case. The Pope, 
  notwithstanding, was overjoyed to think they had found the bones of St. Peter 
  until further examination proved that these bones were those of a woman. This 
  fact came out in an article on [pg. 19] the subject in the S. F. Chronicle of June 27, 
  1968. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To continue the history of another case in which they have 
  erred: In spite of the statements by the high Papal authority above and the 
  resultant lesson that should have been learned, the Pope, a year later claimed 
  the Prof. Margherita bones as his very own, that is, those of St. Peter. When 
  the bones were found there was little importance placed upon them and they 
  were filed away as such. But when the first set of Peter’s bones turned out so 
  tragically, there was a vacuum left and something had to be done. Again they 
  turned their thoughts to the filed-away bones, the only hope they had of 
  success. In them there was a ray of hopes for the bones were minus a skull, 
  which could go along with the story of the supposed skull of St. Peter which 
  had for centuries been guarded in the church of St. John Lateran in Rome. With 
  a generous mixture of ideas, suppositions, theories and wishful thinking, a 
  fairly logical story emerged. It was then declared by Pope Paul as the Gospel 
  truth, that these now, were the genuine bones of St. Peter, and most of the 
  faithful accepted them as such. For a while all was well until another hitch 
  developed. This time, as fate would have it, the bones in connection with the 
  skull which was guarded for centuries as that of St. Peter, were found 
  incompatible to the more recent bones of St. Peter. The dilemma was terrible. 
  They were between the Devil and the deep blue sea. They have juggled around 
  the skulls of St. Peter causing confusion. It was a choice of claiming these 
  bones championed by Prof. Margherita as fake, or claiming as fake the skull 
  accepted by hundreds of Popes as that of St. Peter. They rejected the past 
  rather than expose themselves to the ridicule of the present. Prof. Margherita 
  claims in this article which appeared in the Manchester Guardian in London, as 
  well as the S. F. Chronicle of June 27, 1968, concerning the long accepted 
  skull of St. Peter, as &quot;it is a fake.&quot; Then the article continues, &quot;The 
  hundreds of Popes and millions of Roman Catholics who have accepted and 
  venerated the other skull were innocent victims of another early tradition.&quot; 
  [A similar article in the <i>
  <a href="../www.biblelight.info/Sources/Press-Telegram-Long-Beach-Jan-3-68.gif">
  Press Telegram</a></i>, Long Beach Calif., Jan. 3, 1968]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the most astounding statement in the long article found 
  in the above mentioned newspapers is, &quot;The professor did not submit them 
  (Peter’s bones?) to modern scientific tests, which would have determined the 
  approximate age, because, she feared, the process would have reduced them to 
  dust.&quot; How could any scientific study of bones be carried out without first 
  scientifically determining the age of the person, or bones? This would be of 
  the greatest interest and the most important for further research. Also any 
  scientist or chemist knows that you do not have to submit the whole skeleton 
  for testing to determine the age. A part of the shin bone or of a rib would be 
  sufficient. It appears that she was protecting her &quot;Peter’s bones&quot; from 
  another [pg. 20] possible disaster, which a wrong age would have caused. The Vatican 
  and others have calculated through all existing evidence that Peter lived to 
  be around 80 and 82 years, and that he died around the years of 62 or 64 A.D. 
  These figures go along perfectly, as does everything else in the case, with 
  the remains found in the Christian burial ground on the Mount of Olives and in 
  the ossuary on which was &quot;clearly and beautifully written,&quot; Simon Bar Jona in 
  Aramaic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following was taken from the book, <i>Races of Mankind</i>, page 161: &quot;Strained attempts to have Peter, the Apostle to the 
    Hebrews of the East, in Paul’s territory at Rome and martyred there are 
    unworthy of serious consideration in the light of all contemporary evidence. 
    At his age (eighty-two), that would not have been practicable. In none of 
    Paul’s writings is there the slightest intimation that Peter ever had been 
    or was at that city. All statements to the contrary were made centuries 
    later and are fanciful and hearsay. The Papacy was not organized until the 
    second half of the 8th century. It broke away from the Eastern Church (in 
    the Ency. Brit., 13th Ed., vol. 21, page 636) under Pippin III; also the 
    Papacy, by Abbe Guette.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great historian, Schaff, states that the idea of Peter 
  being in Rome is irreconcilable with the silence of the Scriptures, and even 
  with the mere fact of Paul’s epistle to the Romans. In the year 58, Paul wrote 
  his epistle to the Roman church, but does not mention Peter, although he does 
  name 28 leaders in the church at Rome (Rom. 16:7). It must, therefore, be 
  concluded that if the whole subject is faced with detached objectivity, the 
  conclusion must inevitably be reached that Peter was never in Rome. Paul lived 
  and wrote in Rome, but he declared that &quot;Only Luke is with me.&quot; [1
