<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Be it enacted by the Senate and House 
  of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled,</i> 
  That no person or corporation, or the agent, servant, or employee of any 
  person or corporation, shall perform or authorize to be performed, any secular 
  work, labor, or business, to the disturbance of others, works of necessity, 
  mercy, and humanity excepted; nor shall any person engage in any play, game, 
  or amusement, or recreation, to the disturbance of others, on the first day of 
  the week, commonly known as the Lord's day, or during any part thereof, in any 
  territory, district, vessel, or place, subject to the exclusive jurisdiction 
  of the United States; nor shall it be lawful for any person or corporation to 
  receive pay for labor or service performed or rendered in violation of this 
  section. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 2. That no mails or mail matter shall hereafter be 
  transported in time of peace over any land postal route, nor shall any mail 
  matter be collected, assorted, handled, or delivered during any part of the 
  first day of the week: <i>Provided,</i> That whenever any letter shall relate 
  to work of necessity or mercy, or shall concern the health, life, or decease 
  of any person, and the fact shall be plainly stated upon the face of the 
  envelope containing the same, the Postmaster-General shall provide for the 
  transportation of such letter or letters in packages separate from other mail 
  matter, and shall make regulations for the delivery thereof, the same having 
  been received at its place of destination before the said first day of the 
  week, during such limited portion of the day as shall best suit the public 
  convenience and least interfere with the due observance of the day as one of 
  worship and rest: <i>And provided further,</i> That when there shall have been 
  an interruption in the due and regular transmission of the mails, it shall be 
  lawful to so far examine the same when delivered as to ascertain if there be 
  such matter therein for lawful delivery on the first day of the week. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 3. That the prosecution of commerce between the 
  States and with the Indian tribes, the same not being work of necessity, 
  mercy, nor humanity, by the transportation of persons or property by land or 
  water in such way as to interfere with or disturb the people in the enjoyment 
  of the first day of the week, or any portion thereof, as a day of rest from 
  labor, the same not being labor of necessity, mercy, or humanity, or its 
  observance as a day of religious worship, is hereby prohibited; and any person 
  or corporation, or the agent or employee of any person or corporation, who 
  shall willfully violate this section, shall be punished by a fine of not less 
  than ten nor more than one thousand dollars; and no service performed in the 
  prosecution of such prohibited commerce shall be lawful, nor shall any 
  compensation be recoverable or be paid for the same.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 4. That all military and naval drills, musters, and 
  parades, not in time of active service or immediate preparation therefor, of 
  soldiers, sailors, marines, or cadets of the United States, on the first day 
  of the week, except assemblies for the due and orderly observance of religious 
  worship, are hereby prohibited, nor shall any unnecessary labor be performed 
  or
  permitted in the military or naval service of the United States on the Lord's 
  day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 5. That it shall be unlawful to pay or to receive 
  payment or wages in any manner for service rendered, or for labor performed, 
  or for the transportation of persons or of property in violation of the 
  provisions of this act, nor shall any action lie for the recovery thereof; and 
  when so paid, whether in advance or otherwise, the same may be recovered back 
  by whoever shall first sue for the same. <br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SECTION 6. That labor or service performed and rendered on 
  the first day of the week in consequence of accident, disaster, or unavoidable 
  delays in making the regular connections upon postal routes and routes of 
  travel and transportation, the preservation of perishable and exposed 
  property, and the regular and necessary transportation and delivery of 
  articles of food in condition for healthy use, and such transportation for 
  short distances from one State, District, or Territory, into another State, 
  District, or Territory, as by local laws shall be declared to be necessary for 
  the public good, shall not be deemed violations of this act, but the same 
  shall be construed, so far as possible, to secure to the whole people rest 
  from toil during the first day of the week, their mental and moral culture and 
  the religious observance of the Sabbath day.</p>
