  <hr>
  <p>Yasser Arafat is reported by Reuters, on October 23rd, 2000, as having sent
  a personal appeal to Pope John Paul II to intervene and help resolve the
  Middle East crisis. The appeal by Arafat was revealed by Nemer Hammad, the top
  Palestinian Authority official in Italy, who said &quot;Palestinians need the
  intervention of such a prestigious person who is above politics.''</p>
  <p>The major point of contention between Palestinians and Israelis is East
  Jerusalem and temple mount, the site of Solomon's and Herod's temple,
  destroyed in 70 A.D. by the armies of Rome. The book of Daniel makes an
  interesting prediction about temple mount:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:45 And he [Antichrist] shall plant the tabernacles of his palace
    between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his
    end, and none shall help him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jerusalem lies between two seas, the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea, and
  the <i>glorious holy mountain</i> surely refers to temple mount. It will be
  very interesting to see what role the Vatican plays in solving the crisis over
  East Jerusalem. The Bible apparently indicates that very near the end of time,
  the Pope will actually quit Rome, and move to Jerusalem, in order to exercise
  control over the glorious holy mountain of God, which is the explicit stated
  goal of Satan:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 14:13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I
    will exalt my throne above the stars of God: <b>I will sit also upon the
    mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north</b>:<br>
    Isa 14:14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
    most High.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(The mount of the congregation, temple mount, is north of the old city of
  David in Jerusalem)</p>
  <p>How soon might that happen? Perhaps sooner than we might think. We can only
  watch, and wait.</p>
