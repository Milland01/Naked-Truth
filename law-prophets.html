<title>THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</title>
</head>

<body>

<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="5">THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS</font></p>
  <hr>
  <p>The following verses refer to the law and to the testimony:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the 
    testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</p>
    <p>Isa 8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</p>
    <p>Isa 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to 
    this word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above verses considered collectively show that the law and the 
  testimony are both God's word, they are truth, and they are bound and sealed 
  among God's true people. The next verse explains a little more about what God's 
  testimony is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Neh 9:26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, 
    and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which <u>
    testified</u> against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great 
    provocations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is the <i>prophets</i> of the Lord that give God's <i>testimony</i> to the 
  people. So when the word of God is described as the law and the testimony, it 
  is the equivalent of the law and the prophets, as in the following verses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jer 2:8 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the 
    law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets 
    prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</p>
    <p>Lam 2:9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken 
    her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no 
    more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</p>
    <p>Zep 3:4 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have 
    polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</p>
    <p>Zec 7:12 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they 
    should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his 
    spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of 
    hosts.<br>
    Zec 7:13 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not 
    hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</p>
    <p>Mat 5:17 <font color="#FF0000">Think not that I am come to destroy the 
    law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 7:12 <font color="#FF0000">Therefore all things whatsoever ye would 
    that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and 
    the prophets.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 11:13 <font color="#FF0000">For all the prophets and the law 
    prophesied until John.<br>
    </font><br>
    Mat 22:40 <font color="#FF0000">On these two commandments hang all the law 
    and the prophets.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 16:16<font color="#FF0000"> The law and the prophets were until 
    John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth 
    into it.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 24:44 And he said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">These are the 
    words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must 
    be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, 
    and in the psalms, concerning me.</font></p>
    <p>John 1:45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found 
    him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of 
    Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</p>
    <p>Acts 13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers 
    of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any 
    word of exhortation for the people, say on.<font color="#FF0000"><br>
    <br>
    </font>Acts 24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which 
    they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things 
    which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p>
    <p>Acts 28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him 
    into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, 
    persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of 
    the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
    <p>Rom 3:21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, 
    being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that in several of the above verses Moses is equated with the law. 
  So, Moses and the prophets means the same as the law and the prophets, or the 
  law and the testimony, which is to say the word of God.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 16:29 <font color="#FF0000">Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses 
    and the prophets; let them hear them.</font><br>
    Luke 16:30 <font color="#FF0000">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if 
    one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</font><br>
    Luke 16:31 <font color="#FF0000">And he said unto him, If they hear not 
    Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from 
    the dead.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto 
    them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
    <p>Acts 26:22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this 
    day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those 
    which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</p>
    <p align="center"><b>DANIEL AND THE REVELATION</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Now, notice how the enemy of God, the little horn power, is 
  described in Daniel:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Dan 7:8 ... and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the 
    eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Dan 7:25 And he shall speak great words <b>against the most 
    High</b>,<br>
    and shall wear out the saints <b>of the most High</b>,<br>
    and think to change times and laws <b>(of the most High):</b><br>
    and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the 
    dividing of time.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Note what I added in parenthesis above. The Little Horn (The 
  Papacy) thinks to be able to change times and laws, and in context it is 
  speaking about the times and laws of God. The little horn power thinks to 
  change these two specific things. Note the following description of the true 
  church:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war 
    with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have 
    the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And again, what is the testimony of Jesus?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See 
    thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the 
    testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of 
    prophecy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, Satan is angry with,&nbsp;and makes war with the true church, because 
  they keep the law of God, the 10 commandments, and have and understand the 
  spirit of prophecy. Those are <u>exactly</u> what the little horn power of Daniel 
  thinks to <i>change </i>in an attempt to deceive people.</p>
  <p align="left"><b><u>1. Tampering with God's Unchangeable Law:</u></b></p>
  <p align="left">So has the Papacy, the Roman Catholic Church, claimed that the 
  Law of of God, the Ten Commandments can be changed? Indeed they do. They think 
  they have done it by changing the Sabbath day of rest to Sunday!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="seal.html">The Seal of God and The Mark 
    of the Beast</a></b> </li>
    <li><b><a href="notsun.html">Sunday is NOT the biblical 
    Sabbath day.</a></b> </li>
    <li><b><a href="covenant-seal.html">The Seal of God in 
    the Old and New Covenants</a>.</b> </li>
    <li><b><a href="chalng.html#">Rome's Challenge ... Why 
    do Protestants keep Sunday?</a></b> </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left"><u><b>2. Changing the Times of God:</b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Acts 1:6 When they therefore were come together, they asked 
    of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to 
    Israel?<br>
    Acts 1:7 And he said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">It is not for you to 
    know <u>the times</u> or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own 
    power.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The &quot;times&quot; of the most high are appointed times in the 
  future, which is to say events which are <i>prophesied</i> to occur. One of these 
  important prophetic times is specifically mentioned in Daniel 7:25 - &quot;and they shall be given into 
  his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.&quot; That refers to 
  3-1/2 times, or 1260 days which in prophetic time means 1260 years. This 
  prophetic time is a major one that Satan wants to obscure and deceive people 
  about. See:</p>
