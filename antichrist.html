<blockquote>
  <p>With the advent of the printing press in the15th century, and the
resulting explosion of Bibles accessible in the common language from
Protestant sources, it became readily apparent to those who could now
study the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation in particular, that Bible
prophecy identified by symbols a persecuting apostate entity generally
known as antichrist. The following table shows the common elements from
several places in scripture that aid in identifying this antichrist
power:</p>

  <p align="center"><u><strong><font size="5">HISTORICISM</font></strong></u></p>
  <p>Now if we list and develop the above characteristics of
antichrist, the following becomes readily apparent:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. It will rise to be a great power after the fall of the pagan
Roman empire (after 476 A.D.). See <b> <a
 href="fathers-on-antichrist.html">Early Church Fathers on Antichrist.</a></b><br>
2. It will be a geographically small nation (a little horn).<br>
3. It will rule over many people, nations, and tongues (it will be
universal).<br>
4. It will be headquartered in the city of seven hills, Rome.<br>
5. It will be a religio-political entity &#8212; a political city-state ruled
by a priest-king.<br>
6. Its priest-king will make great and blasphemous claims.<br>
7. It will claim authority over all kings.<br>
8. It will claim its power to change the holy times and laws of God as
its mark of authority.<br>
9. It will be an apostate church, that makes the nations drink her cup
of apostate doctrine.<br>
10. It will be a "mother" church, with apostate daughters coming from
her.<br>
11. It will be a persecuting power, killing the faithful saints of
Jesus Christ as heretics.<br>
12. It will hold power and authority for 1260 years following the fall
of pagan Rome.<br>
13. It will suffer a deadly wound that will end 1260 years of dominance
and persecution.<br>
14. It will be revived after the deadly wound, and all the world will
wonder at it's revival.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In this the "Historical" interpretation, the antichrist was
clearly not merely a single individual, it was a <em>system</em> of
apostasy and persecution that would hold sway for over twelve
centuries: </p>
	<p class="auto-style1">... this apostasy was to have a head, and the coming 
	and character of that head are the great subject of Paul's Thessalonian 
	prophecy. A mistaken apprehension of his first letter to them had led the 
	Thessalonians to expect an immediate advent of Christ, and in his second 
	epistle Paul sets himself to correct this error by further instruction as to 
	the future. He tells them of something that was destined to precede the 
	return of Christ, a great apostasy, which would reach its climax in the 
	manifestation of a certain mighty power of evil; to which he attaches three 
	names, and of which he gives many particulars similar to those which Daniel 
	gave of his &quot;little horn,&quot; such as the place and time of its origin, its 
	nature, sphere, character, conduct, and doom.<br><br>The names which the 
	apostle gives to this head of the apostasy in this prophecy are &quot;that man of 
	sin, . . . the son of perdition,&quot; and &quot;that wicked&quot; or &quot;lawless&quot; one. These 
	expressions might convey to the mind of superficial readers the idea that 
	the predicted head of the apostasy would be an <em>individual</em>. Careful 
	study however shows this to be a false impression�an impression for which 
	there is no solid foundation in the passage. The expressions themselves, 
	when analysed grammatically, are seen to bear another signification quite as 
	well, if not better, and the context demands that they be understood in a 
	dynastic sense. &quot;The man of sin,&quot; like &quot;the man of God,&quot; has a broad, 
	extended meaning. When we read &quot;that the man of God may be perfect, 
	throughly furnished unto all good works,&quot; we do not suppose it means any one 
	individual man, although it has the definite article. It indicates a whole 
	class of men of a certain character, succession of similar individuals. The 
	use of the definite article (analogous to the omission of the article in 
	Greek) does indeed limit an expression of the kind. <em>A</em> man of sin 
	could be only one, just as a king of England could mean only an individual.
	<em>The</em> king, on the other hand, may include a whole dynasty. A king 
	has but the life of an individual, the king never dies. When, in speaking of 
	the Jewish tabernacle in Hebrews, Paul says that into the holiest of all 
	&quot;went <em>the</em> high priest alone once every year,&quot; he includes the 
	entire succession of the high priests of Israel. That a singular expression 
	in a prophecy may find its fulfilment in a plurality of individuals is 
	perfectly clear from John's words, &quot;As ye have heard that antichrist shall 
	come, even so now are there <em>many antichrists</em>&quot;<sup> 1</sup><br><br>
	Any doubt or ambiguity as to the true force of the expression &quot;the man of 
	sin&quot; is however removed by a consideration of the context of this passage. 
	Grammatically it may mean either an individual or a succession of similar 
	individuals. The <em>context</em> determines that it actually does mean the 
	latter. &quot;The mystery of iniquity,&quot; in which this man of sin was latent, was 
	already working in Paul's day. The apostasy out of which he was to grow was 
	already in existence. &quot;The mystery of iniquity doth already work.&quot; The man 
	of sin, on the other hand, was to continue till the second advent of Christ, 
	which is still future; for he is destroyed, as it is distinctly stated, only 
	by the brightness of the epiphany. The interval between Paul's days and 
	those of the still future advent was then to be filled by the great apostasy 
	in either its incipient working as a mystery of iniquity or its open 
	manifestation and great embodiment in the career of &quot; the man of sin and son 
	of perdition.&quot; That career must consequently extend over more than a 
	thousand years, for the process of gestation is certainly briefer than the 
	duration of life. In this case of the man of sin <em>the two together occupy 
	at least eighteen centuries</em>. What proportion of the period can we 
	assign to the hidden, mysterious growth of this power, and what to its 
	wonderfully active and influential life? The life must of course occupy the 
	larger half, to say the least of it, and therefore, as no individual lives 
	on through ages, we may be sure that it is a succession of men, a dynasty of 
	rulers, that is intended by the ambiguous expression. We, students of the 
	nineteenth century, may be sure of this, though the students of early 
	centuries could not. &mdash; <em>Romanism and the Reformation, From the

	<p>The inevitable conclusion of those who studied these
prophesies in scripture, before and during the Protestant Reformation,
was that there was <i>only one entity</i> that fit all the above
characteristics: the papal dynasty of the Roman Catholic Church. Is it
any wonder that the Catholic Church was so violently opposed to the
scriptures being available for everyone to read for themselves? There
was such a stir created during the reformation that the&nbsp;<img
 src="star.gif" height="12" width="16"><strong> <a
 href="http://www.piar.hu/councils/ecum18.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a></strong>
(1512-17 A.D.) resorted to strictly forbidding <em>anyone</em> to
publish a book without prior censorship, and also prohibited <em>anyone</em>
from preaching on the subject of antichrist:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>SESSION 10, 4 May 1515, On censorship of books:</p>
    <p>... "some printers have the boldness to print and sell to the
public, in different parts of the world, books &#8212; some translated into
Latin from Greek, Hebrew, Arabic and Chaldean as well as some issued
directly in Latin or a vernacular language &#8212; containing errors opposed
to the faith as well as pernicious views contrary to the Christian
religion and to the reputation of prominent persons of rank. The
readers are not edified. Indeed, they lapse into very great errors not
only in the realm of faith but also in that of life and morals. This
has often given rise to various scandals, as experience has taught, and
there is daily the fear that even greater scandals are developing." ...</p>
    <p>... "We therefore establish and ordain that henceforth, for all
future time, no one may dare to print or have printed any book or other
writing of whatever kind in Rome or in any other cities and dioceses,
without the book or writings having first been closely examined, at
Rome by our vicar and the master of the sacred palace, in other cities
and dioceses by the bishop or some other person who knows about the
printing of books and writings of this kind and who has been delegated
to this office by the bishop in question, and also by the inquisitor of
heresy for the city or diocese where the said printing is to take
place, and unless the books or writings have been approved by a warrant
signed in their own hand, which must be given, under pain of
excommunication, freely and without delay."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the printed books being seized and
publicly burnt, payment of a hundred ducats to the fabric of the
basilica of the prince of the apostles in Rome, without hope of relief,
and suspension for a whole year from the possibility of engaging in
printing, there is to be imposed upon anyone presuming to act otherwise
the sentence of excommunication." ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>SESSION 11, 19 December 1516, On how to preach:</p>
    <p>... "We command all who undertake this task of preaching, or
will later undertake it, to preach and expound the gospel truth and
holy scripture in accordance with the exposition, interpretation and
commentaries that the church or long use has approved and has accepted
for teaching until now, and will accept in the future, without any
addition contrary to its true meaning or in conflict with it. They are
always to insist on the meanings which are in harmony with the words of
sacred scripture and with the interpretations, properly and wisely
understood, of the doctors mentioned above. They are in no way to
presume to preach or declare a fixed time for future evils, the coming
of antichrist or the precise day of judgment; for Truth says, it is not
for us to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own
authority. Let it be known that those who have hitherto dared to
declare such things are liars, and that because of them not a little
authority has been taken away from those who preach the truth." ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>But the Catholic Church eventually came to the conclusion that it
would not be able to ban or burn all the Bibles, heretical books, and
heretics that possessed or preached from them. This oppressive and
crude tactic merely <em> confirmed</em> their identification as the
harlot persecuting church of prophecy. A new and more subtle approach
was needed in order to effectively counter the application of
apocalyptic prophecy to the Catholic Church.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>One major identifying characteristic the Catholic Church needed to
deal with was the time period of 1260 years that the antichrist power
was to rule, according to Protestantism's Historicist interpretation.
There simply is <em> only one entity on earth</em> that has ruled for
this length of time after the fall of pagan Rome, and that is the Roman
Catholic Church (See also <img src="star.gif" height="12" width="16"><strong>
  <a href="times.html">Time, Times, and Half a Time?</a></strong> and <img
 src="star.gif" height="12" width="16"> <strong><a href="dragon.html">The
Red Dragon and Rome</a></strong>). </p>
  <p>A new "interpretation" would have to be found that deflected
attention away from the twelve century papal rule of the middle ages.
This would fulfill the prophecy of Dan 7:25, that the little horn power
would think to change the prophetic set times of the most High, just
like king Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon thought to change the prophetic
vision of the statue man in Daniel chapter 2, by building an all gold
statue in chapter 3. The little horn, Mystery Babylon, would in like
manner, try to deny and obscure the meaning of prophecy.</p>

      <p align="justify"><b><font size="4">Francisco Ribera</font></b>
(1537-1591) was a Jesuit doctor of theology, born in Spain, who began
writing a lengthy commentary in 1585 on the book of Revelation
(Apocalypse) titled <em>In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, &amp;
Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarij</em>, and published it about the
year 1590. He died in 1591 at the age of fifty-four, so he was not able
to expand on his work or write any other commentaries on Revelation. In
order to remove the Catholic Church from consideration as the
antichrist power, Ribera proposed that the first few chapters of the
Apocalypse applied to ancient pagan Rome, and the rest he limited to a
yet future period of 3 1/2 literal years, immediately prior to the
second coming. During that time, the Roman Catholic Church would have
fallen away from the pope into apostasy. Then, he proposed, <em>the</em>
antichrist, a <em>single</em> individual, would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persecute and blaspheme the saints of God.</li>
        <li>Rebuild the temple in Jerusalem.</li>
        <li>Abolish the Christian religion.</li>
        <li>Deny Jesus Christ.</li>
        <li>Be received by the Jews.</li>
        <li>Pretend to be God.</li>
        <li>Kill the two witnesses of God.</li>
        <li>Conquer the world.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">So, according to Ribera, the 1260 days and 42 months
and 3 1/2 times of prophecy were not 1260 years, but a <em>literal</em>
3 1/2 years, and therefore <em>none</em> of the book of Revelation had
any application to the middle ages or the papacy, but to the future, to
a period immediately prior to the second coming, hence the name <em>Futurism.

<blockquote>
  <p><b><font size="4">Manuel De Lacunza</font></b> (1731&#8211;1801), a
Jesuit from Chile, wrote a manuscript in Spanish titled <i>La Venida
del Mesias en Gloria y Magestad </i>("The Coming of the Messiah in
Glory and Majesty"), under the pen name of Juan Josafa [Rabbi] Ben-Ezra
about 1791. Lacunza wrote under an assumed Jewish name to obscure the
fact that he was a Catholic, in order to give his book better
acceptance in Protestantism, his intended audience. Also an advocate of
Futurism, Lacunza was deliberately attempting to take the pressure off
the papacy by proposing that the Antichrist was still off in the
future. His manuscript was published in London, Spain, Mexico and Paris
between 1811 and 1826.&nbsp;

National Library of Chile (in Spanish).</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font size="4">Edward Irving</font></b>
(1792-1834), a Scottish Presbyterian and forerunner of the Pentecostal
and Charismatic movements, translated Lacunza's work from Spanish into
English in a book titled <i>The Coming of Messiah in Glory and Majesty
with a Preliminary Discourse, </i>published in London in 1827 by L.B.
Seeley &amp; Sons, which included Irving's own lengthy preface. Here
are excerpts from Irving's translation:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Lacunza asserts that Antichrist would
appear near the end of time:</font></p>
  <font face="Times New Roman">
  <blockquote>
    <p>That there shall be an Antichrist; that he shall be revealed,
and publicly declared, towards the last times; and that he shall commit
in the world the greatest evils, making formal war against Christ, and
all that pertains to him; &#8212;these are three certain things, of which no
Christian can doubt. -- Vol. I, Part II, Phenomenon III,&nbsp; pg. 195.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Antichrist, Lacunza concludes, would not be just one man:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">ACCORDING</font> to all the signs given in the
Holy Scriptures, and others, not equivocal, offered to us by time,
which is wont to be the best interpreter of the prophecies, the
antichrist, or the contrachrist, with whom we stand threatened in the
times immediate upon the coming of the Lord, is nothing but a moral
body, composed of innumerable individuals, diverse in themselves, but
all morally united and animated with one common spirit, against the
Lord and against his Christ; -- Vol. I, Part II, Phenomenon III,&nbsp;
pg. 196.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As to the harlot woman riding the beast in Revelation 17, Lacunza
acknowledges it is indeed referring to Rome:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... the doctors do all agree, that the woman here spoken of is
the city of Rome, in other times the capital of the greatest empire in
the world, and now the capital and centre of unity of the true
Christian church. On this first point, which is not called in question,
there is no occasion to tarry. -- Vol. I, Part II, Phenomenon
III,&nbsp; pg. 240.</p>
    <p>... it is not present Rome which is at all spoken of here, but
future Rome alone to which the prophecy hath its determinate
application. -- Vol. I, Part II, Phenomenon III,&nbsp; pg. 251.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Rome yes, Lacunza agrees, but <i>not</i> the Roman Catholic
Church of his day, which he calls the true church, rather he pushes
this prophecy in Revelation 17 off into the future:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rome, not idolatrous but Christian, not the head of the Roman
empire but the head of Christendom, and centre of unity of the true
church of the living God, may very well, without ceasing from this
dignity, at some time or other incur the guilt, and before God be held
guilty of fornication with the kings of the earth, and amenable to all
its consequences. And in this there is not any inconsistency, however
much her defenders may shake the head. And this same Rome, in that same
state, may receive upon herself the horrible chastisement spoken of in
the prophecy; -- Vol. I, Part II, Phenomenon III,&nbsp; pg. 252.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This apostate Christian group termed Antichrist would be:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>... slain and destroyed by Christ himself in the great day of
his coming in glory and majesty. -- Vol. I, Part II, Phenomenon
IV,&nbsp; pg. 292.</p>

  <p><b><font size="4">Margaret McDonald</font></b>, a 15 year old
Scottish girl, and member of Edward Irving's congregation, had visions
in early 1830 that included a Secret Rapture of believers before the
appearance of the Antichrist. She informed Irving of her visions by
letter. Irving then attended the prophecy conferences that began in
Dublin Ireland in 1830 at Powerscourt Castle, where he promoted <i>both</i>
Futurism and a Secret Rapture.</p>
  <p><b><font size="4">Samuel Roffey Maitland</font></b> (1792-1866),
scholar and librarian to the Archbishop of Canterbury, further promoted
and established Futurism in England after 1826, as a result of reading
the work of Manuel De Lacunza. He concluded that the 3 1/2 times, 42
months, and 1260 days of Daniel and Revelation were all intended to be
a literal 3 1/2 years, not 1260 years.</p>

meetings on Bible Prophecy that began in 1830 at Powerscourt, Ireland,
and at these conferences Darby apparently learned about the secret
rapture as revealed by vision to Margaret McDonald, and promoted by
Edward Irving, and he soon visited Margaret MacDonald at her home in
Port Glasgow, Scotland. Darby later visited America several times
between 1859 and 1874, where his Futurist theology was readily accepted.</p>

The Hope Of Christ's Second Coming</a></i> in 1864, in which he gave
the following testimony on the origin of the secret rapture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"I am not aware that there was any definite teaching that there
would be a <i> secret </i>rapture of the Church at a secret coming,
until this was given forth as an "utterance" in Mr. Irving&#8217;s Church,
from what was there received as being the voice of the Spirit. But
whether any one ever asserted such a thing or not, it was from that
supposed revelation that the modern doctrine and the modern phraseology
respecting it arose. It came not from Holy Scripture, but from that
which falsely pretended to be the Spirit of God, while not owning the
true doctrine of our Lord&#8217;s incarnation in the same flesh and blood as
His brethren, but without taint of sin." -- Footnote 1 for Chapter 9.</p>

Released first on video cassette, and then in theaters in early 2001,
people who have seen <i>Left Behind</i> say it is confusing, and lacks
a Gospel presentation of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ,
making it of little (if any) evangelistic value, much like TBN's <i> <a

      <p align="left">Another counter-interpretation to the Historicism
held by Protestantism was proposed by the Spanish Jesuit <b>Luis De
Alcazar</b> (1554-1613), who also wrote a commentary called <em>Investigation
of the Hidden Sense of the Apocalypse, </em>which ran to some 900
pages. In it he proposed that it <em>all</em> of Revelation applied to
the era of pagan Rome and the first six centuries of Christianity.
According to Alcazar (or Alcasar):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revelation chapters 1-11 describes the rejection of the
Jews and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans.</li>
        <li>Revelation chapters 12 - 19 were the overthrow of Roman
paganism (the great harlot) and the conversion of the empire to the
church.</li>
        <li>Revelation 20 describe the final persecutions by
Antichrist, who is identified as Caesar Nero (54-68 A.D.), and judgment.</li>
        <li>Revelation 21 -22 describe the triumph of the New
Jerusalem, the Roman Catholic Church.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Again, Alcazar found no application of prophecy to the middle ages
or to the papacy. That his interpretation differed so greatly from that
put forth by Francisco Ribera or Cardinal Bellarmine, mattered little.
Catholicism, the supposedly divine and infallible interpreter of
scripture, was presenting two vastly different and quite incompatible
interpretations of prophecy in a desperate effort to counter the claims
of the reformers.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="5"><u>THE GREAT CATHOLIC
DIVERSION REVEALED</u></font></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>The intent of both Futurism and Preterism was to be diversionary,
to counter or offset the Protestant Historical interpretation, and
present alternatives, no matter how implausible they might be. The
result is evident from the following chart, which illustrates the three
schools of interpretation regarding antichrist:</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Now the truly amazing part of all this is that the
Futurist theory dominates Protestant teaching today. About all you hear
or read about today is the yet-to-appear antichrist, who will be
unveiled in the last 3 1/2 years of Daniel's 70th week, when he
declares himself to be God in a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. That
scenario, as you can now see, is directly traceable back to the pen of
the Jesuit Francisco Ribera. Note what one Protestant writer had to say
over <em>one hundred years ago:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next we come to consider the
time of the rise of the <i>Futurist</i> system as we now have it, and
the occasion which led to it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So great a hold did the conviction that the Papacy
was the Antichrist gain upon the minds of men, that Rome at last saw
she must bestir herself, and try, by putting forth other systems of
interpretation, to counteract the identification of the Papacy with the
Antichrist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, towards the close of the century of the
Reformation, two of her most learned doctors set themselves to the
task, each endeavouring by different means to accomplish the same end,
namely, that of diverting men's minds from perceiving the fulfilment of
the prophecies of the Antichrist in the Papal system. The Jesuit
Alcasar devoted himself to bring into prominence the <em>Preterist</em>
method of interpretation, which we have already briefly noticed, and
thus endeavoured to show that the prophecies of Antichrist were
fulfilled before the Popes ever ruled in Rome, and therefore could not
apply to the Papacy. On the other hand the Jesuit Ribera tried to set
aside the application of these prophecies to the Papal Power by
bringing out the <em>Futurist</em> system, which asserts that these
prophecies refer properly not to the career of the Papacy, but to that
of some future supernatural individual, who is yet to appear, and to
continue in power for three and a half years. Thus, as Alford says, the
Jesuit Ribera, about <font size="2">A.D.</font> 1580, may be regarded
as the Founder of the Futurist system in modern times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a matter for deep regret that those who hold
and advocate the Futurist system at the present day, Protestants as
they are for the most part, are thus really playing into the hands of
Rome, and helping to screen the Papacy from detection as the
Antichrist. It has been well said that "Futurism tends to obliterate
the brand put by the Holy Spirit upon Popery." More especially is this
to be deplored at a time when the Papal Antichrist seems to be making
an expiring effort to regain his former hold on men's minds. Now once
again, as at the Reformation, it is especially necessary that his true
character should be recognized, by all who would be faithful to "the
testimony of Jesus."</p>
    <p align="left">From <em>Daniel and the Revelation: The Chart of
Prophecy and Our Place In It, A Study of the Historical and Futurist
Interpretation, </em>by Joseph Tanner, published in London by Hodder
and Stoughton, 1898, <a href="Sources/Tanner-pgs16-17.gif">pages 16,17</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">In what could only be described as a stunning
reversal, Protestants have over time actually become the papacy's
greatest ally by spreading its Jesuit spawned propaganda. What irony
that Protestants, who originally broke away from what they <em>clearly</em>
recognized to be the harlot antichrist led church of prophecy, now
champion the Futurist interpretation from high profile global
ministries. Futurism has without doubt, been successful beyond the
wildest dreams of its Jesuit authors. The same can be said for the
Preterist interpretation of Luis De Alcazar, although to a lesser
degree.</p>
