      <p align="center"><font size="6">The Bible on False Prophets</font></p>
      <hr>
  <P align="center"><font size="6">The Old Testament</font></P>
      <p><u><b>The True Prophet Hears From God Through Dreams:</b></u></p>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Num 12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I 
  the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him 
  in a dream.</P>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>The True Prophet Preaches Repentance And Obedience To God's Law </b>
  </u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Jer 23:21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken 
  to them, yet they prophesied.<br>
  Jer 23:22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to 
  hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from 
  the evil of their doings.</P>
  <P>Jer 26:4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not 
  hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,<br>
  Jer 26:5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto 
  you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened;<br>
  Jer 26:6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a 
  curse to all the nations of the earth.</P>
  <P>Jer 35:15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up 
  early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and 
  amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall 
  dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have 
  not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.</P>
  <P>Isa 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to 
  this word, it is because there is no light in them.</P>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>Defining The False Prophet And Their Fate:</b></u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Deu 18:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, 
  which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of 
  other gods, even that prophet shall die.<BR>Deu 18:21 And if thou say in thine 
  heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?<BR>Deu 18:22 
  When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor 
  come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the 
  prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.</P>
  <P>Jer 23:14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: 
  they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of 
  evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them 
  unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.</P>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>The Motivation of the False Prophet Is Money:</b></u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Micah 3:9 [NIV] Hear this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, you rulers of 
  the house of Israel, who despise justice and distort all that is right;<br>
  Micah 3:10 [NIV] who build Zion with bloodshed, and Jerusalem with wickedness.<br>
  Micah 3:11 [NIV] Her leaders judge for a bribe, her priests teach for a price, 
  and her prophets tell fortunes for money. Yet they lean upon the LORD and say, 
  &quot;Is not the LORD among us? No disaster will come upon us.&quot;<br>
  Micah 3:12 [NIV] Therefore because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, 
  Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, the temple hill a mound overgrown with 
  thickets.</P>
  <P>Jer 6:13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every 
  one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every 
  one dealeth falsely.<br>
  Jer 6:14 They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, 
  saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.<br>
  Jer 6:15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were 
  not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among 
  them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith 
  the LORD.</P>
  <P>Ezek 22:25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like 
  a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken 
  the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst 
  thereof.<br>
  Ezek 22:26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy 
  things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have 
  they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their 
  eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.<br>
  Ezek 22:27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, 
  to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.<br>
  Ezek 22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing 
  vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the 
  LORD hath not spoken.</P>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>Many People Actually Prefer False Prophets:</b></u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Isa 30:9 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that 
  will not hear the law of the LORD:<br>
  Isa 30:10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not 
  unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:<br>
  Isa 30:11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy 
  One of Israel to cease from before us.<br>
  Isa 30:12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this 
  word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:<br>
  Isa 30:13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, 
  swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.<br>
  Isa 30:14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is 
  broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the 
  bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal 
  out of the pit.</P>
  <P>Jer 5:31 The prophets prophesy lies, the priests rule by their own 
  authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the 
end?</P>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>The Fate Of False Prophets And Those Who Follow Them:</b></u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Jer 14:14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my 
  name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: 
  they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, 
  and the deceit of their heart.<br>
  Jer 14:15 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy 
  in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be 
  in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.<br>
  Jer 14:16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the 
  streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have 
  none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for 
  I will pour their wickedness upon them.</P>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>The Prophecies Of False Prophets Do Not Always Fail:</b></u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>Deu 13:1 If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you 
  and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder,<BR>Deu 13:2 and if the sign 
  or wonder of which he has spoken takes place, and he says, "Let us follow 
  other gods" (gods you have not known) "and let us worship them,"<BR>Deu 13:3 
  you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God 
  is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with 
  all your soul.<BR>Deu 13:4 It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him 
  you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to 
  him.<BR>Deu 13:5 That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he 
  preached rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and 
  redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way 
  the LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among 
  you.</P>
      </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="6">The New Testament</font></p>
  <p><b><u>Wonderful Works Are Done By False Prophets In The Name Of The Lord:</u></b></p>
      <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 7:15 <font color="#FF0000">Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, 
  but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</font><br>
  Mat 7:16 <font color="#FF0000">Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
  or figs of thistles?</font><br>
  Mat 7:17 <font color="#FF0000">Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree 
  bringeth forth evil fruit.</font><br>
  Mat 7:18 <font color="#FF0000">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree 
  bring forth good fruit.</font><br>
  Mat 7:19 <font color="#FF0000">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast 
  into the fire.</font><br>
  Mat 7:20 <font color="#FF0000">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</font><br>
  Mat 7:21 <font color="#FF0000">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the 
  kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</font><br>
  Mat 7:22 <font color="#FF0000">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied 
  in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many 
  wonderful works?</font><br>
  Mat 7:23 <font color="#FF0000">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, 
  ye that work iniquity [lawlessness].</font></p>
      </blockquote>
  <p><u><b>False Prophets Will Be Numerous, And Very Successful:</b></u></p>
      <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 24:11&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000">And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</font><br>
  Mat 24:12 <font color="#FF0000">And because iniquity [lawlessness] shall 
  abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</font></p>
  <p>2 Pet 2:1 [NIV] But there were also false prophets among the people, just as 
  there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce 
  destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought 
  them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.<BR>2 Pet 2:2 [NIV] Many will follow 
  their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.<BR>2 Pet 
  2:3 [NIV] In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made 
  up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction 
  has not been sleeping.</p>
  <p>1 John 4:1&nbsp; Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether 
  they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>
      </blockquote>
  <P><u><b>Many Prefer The False Prophet:</b></u></P>
      <blockquote>
  <P>2 Tim 4:2 [NIV] Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; 
  correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.<br>
  2 Tim 4:3 For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. 
  Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great 
  number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.<br>
  2 Tim 4:4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to 
  myths.</P>
      </blockquote>
      <p><u><b>True Prophets Are Always In Harmony With Other Prophets Of God 
      And Scripture:</b></u></p>
      <blockquote>
  <p align="left">1 Cor 14:32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the 
  prophets.<br>
  1 Cor 14:37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him 
  acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the 
  Lord.</p>
      </blockquote>
  <p><u><b>False Prophets Work Impressive Miracles That Deceive:</b></u></p>
      <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 24:24&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall 
  show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall 
  deceive the very elect.</font><br>
  <br>
  Mark 13:22&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show 
  signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</font></p>
  <P>Rev 13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had 
  two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.<br>
  Rev 13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and 
  causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, 
  whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
  Rev 13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from 
  heaven on the earth in the sight of men,<br>
  Rev 13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those 
  miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them 
  that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which 
  had the wound by a sword, and did live.</P>
  <P>Rev 16:13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth 
  of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the 
  false prophet.<br>
  Rev 16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth 
  unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the 
  battle of that great day of God Almighty.</P>
  <P>Rev 19:20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that 
  wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the 
  mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast 
  alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.</P>
