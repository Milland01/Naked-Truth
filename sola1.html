<p><b><font size="4">THE SOLA SCRIPTURA PRINCIPLE<br>
DOES THE BIBLE TEACH IT?</font></b></p>
</center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sola Scriptura can be defined as the Protestant principle that
scripture alone is a sufficient teacher to gain salvation, and it,
scripture, is the one ruler or standard by which any doctrine of the
church should be judged. If a doctrine cannot be found within the
covers of the 66 books of the Protestant Bible, then it can be safely
rejected, your salvation does not depend on it. Some Catholic
apologists will claim that this Sola Scriptura doctrine did not surface
until the reformation of the 16th century and Martin Luther. Note the
following:</p>
  <div align="center">
  <center>
  <table bgcolor="#eaeaff" border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"
 width="80%">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>This Mediator [Jesus Christ], having spoken what He judged
sufficient first by the prophets, then by His own lips, and afterwards
by the apostles, has besides produced the Scripture which is called
canonical, which has paramount authority, and to which we yield assent
in all matters of which we ought not to be ignorant, and yet cannot
know of ourselves.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </center>
  </div>
  <p>So just who authored this affirmation of the principle of the
sufficiency and paramount authority of the scriptures known as Sola
Scriptura? Was is Martin Luther? Perhaps another Johnny-come-lately
disgruntled 16th century reformer? No, the author is from the 5th
century, 1100 years prior to the Reformation! The author is none other
than St. Augustine, quoted from his <img src="star.gif" height="12"
 width="16"> <a
 href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers/NPNF1-02/Augustine/cog/t57.htm#t57.htm.4">
  <b><em>City of God</em>, book XI, Chapter 3,</b></a> online at the
Christian Classics Ethereal Library server, at Wheaton College.</p>
  <p>Here is the same passage with a slightly different translation:</p>
  <div align="center">
  <center>
  <table bgcolor="#eaeaff" border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"
 width="80%">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">This mediator [Jesus Christ], first through
the Prophets, then by his own lips, afterwards through the Apostles,
revealed whatever he considered necessary. He also inspired Scripture,
which is regarded as canonical and of supreme authority and to which we
give credence concerning all those truths we ought to know and yet, of
ourselves, are unable to learn.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </center>
  </div>
  <p>So scripture, according to St. Augustine, is <b><em>the supreme
authority and reveals all truths we should know.</em></b> That sounds
about as good as any Protestant definition of Sola Scriptura. This
version bears the Imprimatur, Nihil Obstat, and Imprimi Potest of the
Catholic Church and is found in <em>City of God</em> published in 1958
by Image Books, Doubleday, Copyright 1958 by Fathers of the Church,

in order that by teaching we may know what is to be done, and by

already know is to be done; what more can I teach you, than what we
read in the Apostle? For <b>holy Scripture setteth a rule to our

unto each God hath allotted the measure of faith." (Rom 12:3) Be it not
therefore for me to teach you any other thing, save to expound to you
the words of the Teacher, and to treat of them as the Lord shall have

  <p>Here, another church father declares that the plan of salvation as
taught in scripture to be the ground and pillar
of our faith:</p>
  <div align="center">
  <center>
  <table style="border-collapse: collapse;" bgcolor="#eaeaff" border="1"

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p>1. We have learned from none others the plan of our
salvation, than
from those through whom the Gospel has come down to us, which they did
at one time proclaim in public, and, at a later period, by the will of
God, handed down to us in the Scriptures, to be the ground and pillar
of our faith. For it is unlawful to assert that they preached before
they possessed "perfect knowledge," as some do even venture to say,
boasting themselves as improvers of the apostles. For, after our Lord
rose from the dead, [the apostles] were invested with power from on
high when the Holy Spirit came down [upon them], were filled from all
[His gifts], and had perfect knowledge: they departed to the ends of
the earth, preaching the glad tidings of the good things [sent] from
God to us, and proclaiming the peace of heaven to men, who indeed do
all equally and individually possess the Gospel of God. Matthew also
issued a written Gospel among the Hebrews in their own dialect, while
Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, and laying the foundations of
the Church. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and interpreter
of Peter, did also hand down to us in writing what had been preached by
Peter. Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book the Gospel
preached by him. Afterwards, John, the disciple of the Lord, who also
had leaned upon His breast, did himself publish a Gospel during his
residence at Ephesus in Asia.</p>
        <p>2. These have all declared to us that there is one God,
Creator of
heaven and earth, announced by the law and the prophets; and one Christ
the Son of God. If any one do not agree to these truths, he despises
the companions of the Lord; nay more, he despises Christ Himself the
Lord; yea, he despises the Father also, and stands self-condemned,
resisting and opposing his own salvation, as is the case with all
heretics.</p>

  <p>So the Protestant, and <em>even</em> St. Augustine, St.
Athanasius, and St. Iranaeus, on occasion, proclaim the Bible to be the
sole supreme ruler of faith, sufficient to declare the truth, the
pillar and ground of truth with perfect knowledge.<br>
  </p>
  <p>The Catholic responds that the Catholic Church not only has the
authority to preserve, define and interpret scripture, but in addition,
has the authority to define and declare what it calls Tradition, which
it claims is also the Word of God, and has the same validity as
scripture:</p>

faith?</em><br>
A. Yes; because it is a part of God's revealed word, properly called
the unwritten word as the scripture is called the written word.</p>
          <p>Q. <em>What is Tradition? </em>[pg. 87]<br>
A. The doctrines which the Apostles taught by word of mouth, and which
have descended through every successive generation even to our times.</p>
          <p>Q. <em>Are we obliged to believe what tradition teaches,
equally with what is taught by Scripture?</em><br>
A. Yes; we are obliged to believe the one as firmly as the other;
because, what the Apostles <em>preached</em> is as true as what they <em>wrote</em>:
it was the same holy Spirit who spoke by their mouths and by their pen.</p>

  <p>As should be obvious, this distinction between Catholics and
Protestants is no small matter, since Catholics claim that salvation
depends on your belief in dogma that cannot be found in scripture, the
only ruler of faith the Protestants know. What hope then does the
Protestant have?</p>
  <p>The Catholic will quote the following verse to "prove" their
point. I am going to use several different Bibles for comparison, for
those who might contest the validity of the King James.</p>
  <p>From the <b>New American Bible for Catholics</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:15 Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the
traditions that you were taught, either by an oral statement or by a
letter of ours.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Catholic Living Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 The 2:15 With all these things in mind, dear brothers, stand
firm and keep a strong grip on the truth that we taught you in our
letters and during the time we were with you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:14 Therefore, bretheren, stand fast; and hold the
traditions which you have learned, whether by word or by our epistle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1611 King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the
traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1602 Geneva New Testament:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and keep the
instructions which ye have been taught, either by word, or by our
epistle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1534 Tyndale New Testament:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 2:15 Therefore brethren stand fast and keep the ordinances
which ye have learned: whether it were by our preaching, or by epistle.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>And there are these similar statements by Paul:</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">1 Cor 11:1-2 (KJV)</p>
	<p class="auto-style1">
	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'Arial', 'Helvetica', sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 0.7em; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4px; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
	1</span>&nbsp;Be ye followers of me, even as I also <i>am</i> of Christ.<br>
	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'Arial', 'Helvetica', sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 0.7em; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4px; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
	2</span>&nbsp;Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and

	Jesus.<br>
	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'Arial', 'Helvetica', sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 0.7em; VERTICAL-ALIGN: 4px; FONT-WEIGHT: bold">
	2</span>&nbsp;And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the 
	same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
	</p>
	<p>The Catholic appeals to these passages to show that the apostles
taught doctrine orally, without benefit of the written New Testament to
back them up, so therefore, by their thinking, it is really no
different when they teach Catholic Tradition that lacks any scriptural
authority (<a href="tradition-legate.html">See
this page for 2 Th 2:15</a>). But the early pre-New Testament church
DID have a written authority to refer to and adhere to, as the
following shows:</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><em><b>FIRST CITATION</b></em></p>
  <hr>
  <p>From the <b>New American Bible for Catholics</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 17:10 The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas to
Beroea during the night. Upon arrival they went into the synagogue of
the Jews.<br>
Acts 17:11 These Jews were more fair-minded that those in Thessalonica,
for they received the word with all willingness and examined the
scriptures daily to determine whether these things were so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Catholic Living Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 17:10 That night the Christians hurried Paul and Silas to
Beroea, and, as usual, they went to the synagogue to preach.<br>
Acts 17:11 But the people of Beroea were more open minded than those in
Thessalonica, and gladly listened to the message. They searched the
scriptures day by day to check up on Paul and Silas' statements to see
if they were really so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 17:10 But the bretheren immediately sent away Paul and
Silas by night unto Berea. when they were come thither, went into the
synagogue of the Jews.<br>
Acts 17:11 Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who
received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the scriptures,
whether these things were so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas
by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the
Jews.<br>
Acts 17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that
they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Please note that the word noble derives from the Greek word
eugenes, which Strong's defines as follows-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2104. eugenes, yoog-en'-ace; from G2095 and G1096; well born,
i.e. (lit.) high in rank, or (fig.) generous:--more noble, nobleman.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is significant because it clearly is commending the Bereans
over and above the Thessalonicans, because while they listened to Paul
and Silas with an open mind, they still checked what they were told for
accuracy by comparing it with the existing Old Testament scriptures.
They did not just accept what they were told by anyone. They used
scripture as their only ruler for truth. The principle of Sola
Scriptura is very firmly and clearly established in this text.</p>
  <p>Catholics however, object that the New Testament did not exist in
it's complete written form at the time of this incident, so by their
reasoning, it is excluded from this appeal to scriptural authority.
Just how, may I ask, does that change the principle established here?
Scripture was consulted by the Bereans as the final arbiter of the
truth, and this is the exact and precise definition of Sola Scriptura.
Had Paul and Silas orally related Traditions (in the Catholic sense of
the word) that were not in harmony with, or could not be found in the
Old Testament, then the Bereans would have rightly rejected them!</p>
  <p>The principle of Sola Scriptura is very clearly taught here and
the Catholic should face the fact. Their only recourse is to counter
that this situation has somehow changed at some point with the New
Testament church and that Catholic Tradition must now also be
considered in addition to the written word. Please note that this proof
of a change would have to occur after the events in Berea, so this
would automatically remove the four Gospels from consideration since
they precede Paul's ministry in Berea. In any case, the point is the
Bereans were following precisely the principle of Sola Scriptura and
they were commended for it. That in itself shows Sola Scriptura is
indeed taught and applied in the Bible, despite Catholic claims to the
contrary.</p>
  <p>It is also worth noting, that when Paul preached in Thessalonica
and Berea, he reasoned with the people <em>out of the scriptures. </em>From
the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 17:2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and
three sabbath days <span class="auto-style2">reasoned with them out of the scriptures</span>,<br>
Acts 17:3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered,
and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto
you, is Christ.</p>

  <p>Paul used the <em>written</em> word of God to prove that Jesus was indeed 
  the prophesied Messiah the Jews were waiting for:</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Paul in the New Testament never does teach or preach the Assumption of 
	Mary, the Immaculate Conception of Mary, Mary Mediatrix of all grace, 
	Advocate and Coredemptrix, and neither does he teach Papal Infallibility or 
	Purgatory. Scripture demonstrates he taught and preached exactly what he 
	claimed to teach, that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled all the Messiah's 
	requirements as set out in written scripture. Scripture
was <em>the</em> guide by which anyone could judge for themselves if
Jesus of Nazareth met the prophetic requirements completely.</p>
	<p>So where do we see Paul teaching or preaching the sayings and Traditions of 
	the Scribes, Pharisees, or Sadducees? Where does Paul, or any Apostle for 
	that matter, cite the oral law, the Tradition of the elders, the Rabbis, as 
	authoritative, as worthy as scripture for transmitting the Word of God? No 
	where. 
	Jesus, in fact, strongly condemned these oral Traditions (Mat. 15:2-9, Mark 
	7:3-13, Col. 2:8). </p>
	<p>Because of
the success Paul and Silas were having in converting Jew and Gentile
alike to Christianity (vs. 4,12), unbelieving Jews caused an uproar
that drove them out of both Thessalonica and Berea (vs. 5-10, 13-14).
The unbelieving Jews apparently viewed these conversions as a threat to
Judaism as they knew it. But without scripture to use for validating
the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Messiah, Paul would not have been able to
  <em>prove</em> anything.</p>
  <p>There is a rather striking parallel here that bears mentioning:
that being the similarity of Paul's scripture-based ministry in
Thessalonica and Berea, and the Sola Scriptura advocates or Protestant
reformers. They also dared to preach directly from the scriptures, an
act which has historically stirred the wrath of the Catholic Church,
and has generally resulted in persecution down through the centuries,
just like Paul stirred the wrath of the Jews in Thessalonica.</p>
  <p>So can this principle of scriptural authority be found anywhere
else in the bible? Indeed it can.</p>

  <p>From the <b>New American Bible for Catholics:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Tim 3:15 And that from infancy you have known [the] sacred
scriptures, which are capable of giving you wisdom for salvation
through faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Catholic Living Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Tim 3:15 You know how, when you were a small child, you were
taught the holy Scriptures; and it is these that make you wise to
accept God's salvation by trusting in Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>So according to Paul's second letter to Timothy, scripture is
sufficient to make you wise unto salvation. This directly contradicts
Catholic claims that Scripture is insufficient, and dogma defined in
Tradition is also essential to salvation.</p>
  <p><b><u>A Roman Catholic Cardinal Denies Bible Sufficiency To

the highest importance, and because they do not contain all the truths
necessary for salvation.</p>

fortune-tellers (who chirp and mutter); should not a people inquire of
their gods, apply to the dead on behalf of the living!"-<br>
Isa 8:20 then this document will furnish its instruction. That kind of
thing they will surely say.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Catholic Living Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:19 So why are you trying to find out the future by
consulting witches and mediums? Don't listen to their whisperings and
mutterings. Can the living find out the future from the dead? Why not
ask your God?<br>
Isa 8:20 "Check these witches' words against the Word of God!" he says
if their messages are different than mine, it is because I have not
sent them; for they have no light or truth in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:19 And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of
diviners, who mutter in their enchantments; should not the people seek
of their God, for the living of the dead?<br>
Isa 8:20 To the law rather, and to the testimony. And if they speak not
according to this word, they shall not have the morning light.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:19 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that
have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?<br>
Isa 8:20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The words for <i>law</i> and <i>testimony</i> here mean the Word
of God. The word <i>law</i> is <i>torah,</i> and <i>testimony</i> is
  <i>te'uwdah</i>. Torah may mean either the Decalogue or the
Pentateuch, and same can be true of te'uwdah. Isaiah uses both words
together previously in chapter 8-</p>
  <p>From the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:16 Bind up the testimony (te'uwday), seal the law (torah)
among my disciples.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>New American Bible for Catholics:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:16 The record is to be folded and the sealed instruction
kept among my disciples.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Catholic Living Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:16 Write down all these things I am going to do, says the
Lord, and seal it up for the future. Entrust it to some godly man to
pass on down to godly men of future generations.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 8:16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly Isa 8:16 is speaking of the revealed Word of God written
down and contained in the first five books of the Bible, the Torah,
which includes the tablets of testimony, the Ten Commandments, but
there is also a wider application evident from a number of references
to the "law" and the "prophets" (2 Ki 17:13, Neh 9:26, Lam 2:9, Zeph
3:4, Zech 7:12, Matt 5:17, Matt 7:12, Matt 11:13, Matt 22:40, Luke
16:16, John 1:45, Acts 13:15, Acts 24:14, Acts 28:23, Rom 3:21),
meaning Scripture as a whole. There is another phrase with identical
meaning in the New Testament - "Moses and the prophets", found in Luke
16:29,31, Luke 24:27,44, John 1:45, Acts 26:22, and Acts 28:23.</p>
  <p>Note this verse in Revelation that describes those whom Satan is
angered with:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep <b>the commandments
of God</b>, and have <b>the testimony of Jesus Christ</b>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Revelation 12:17 is speaking about the "law and the testimony",
and Revelation 19 further defines "testimony" for us:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 19:10 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said
unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy
brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for <b>the
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Testimony is equated with prophecy, therefore Revelation 12:17 is
actually talking about <i>"the law and the prophets"</i>, the entire
span of&nbsp; Scripture, which the people of God tenaciously adhere to
in the end times, to the great anger of Satan. </p>
  <p>So now return to Isaiah 8:20-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To the law [<i>Moses</i>] and to the testimony [<i>prophets</i>]:
if they speak not according to this word [<i>scripture</i>], it is
because there is no light in them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This then is saying that anyone who does not speak according to
the <i> entire</i> written Word of God, the Scriptures, <i>"the law
and the prophets", or "Moses and the prophets"</i>, if they are not in
harmony with it, then there is no light in them. It again proclaims the
authority of scripture and only scripture, to discern truth and light.</p>

  <p>There is a similar passage in John that is a favorite of Catholics
to quote in support of Tradition-</p>
  <p>From the <b>New American Bible for Catholics:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 21:25 There are also many other things that Jesus did, but
if these were to be described individually, I do not think the whole
world would contain the books that would be written.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Catholic Living Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 21:25 And I suppose that if all the other events in Jesus'
life were written, the whole world could hardly contain the books!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 21:25 But there are also may other thing which Jesus did;
which, if they were written every one, the world itself, I think, would
not be able to contain the books that should be written.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 21:25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did,
the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the
world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>John said in 20:30 that a sufficient number of the signs or
miracles performed by Jesus ARE included in scripture to validate that
He was indeed the Messiah, so that you will have a saving faith. Again,
scripture includes whatever is necessary to bring you to a saving
faith. Nothing that is necessary for salvation is left out. John 21:25
in no way changes that, nor can it be cited for proof of unwritten
articles of faith (Tradition) required for salvation. It says
essentially that not every <i>deed</i> or <i>action</i> of Jesus is
recorded, (Just as John had stated earlier) but he again does not even
hint at unrecorded doctrines.</p>

defines as the word of truth. But then, what Catholic would deny that
scripture is the word of God? None of course... but they would reply
that the written word is not the sole word of God. Catholic Tradition
they would say, as declared by the church, has equal authority, as

the successors of the apostles so that, enlightened by the Spirit of

  <p>Here Jesus tells the Jews to study and <em><b>search the
scriptures</b></em>, because they know that the way to eternal life can
indeed be found there. That way to eternal life is revealed in
scripture as Jesus Christ, <em>the</em> Messiah that the Jews had
longed for. But the Jews did not even believe what Moses had written,
and as a result repeatedly fell into apostasy. Jesus makes the point
that if the Jews will not believe and obey what Moses had <em><b>
written</b></em> in scripture, then how could they possibly believe the
words <em><b>spoken</b></em> directly to them by the Christ that the
scriptures reveal? Had the Jews properly understood and believed the
scriptures, they would have recognized Jesus for who He was, the very
Son of God.</p>
  <p>So this passage teaches that the<b> <em>written</em></b> word of
God is sufficient to reveal the way to eternal life, which is none
other than Jesus Christ. It is as true today as it was the day it was

no man count of himself beyond that which is above written: that one

  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>Amplified Bible:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 4:6 Now I have applied all this [about parties and
factions] to myself and Apollos for your sakes, bretheren, so that from
what I have said of us [as illustrations] you may learn [to think of
men in accordance with Scripture and] not to go beyond that which is
written; that none of you may be puffed up <em>and</em> inflated with
pride <em>and</em> boast in favor of one [minister and teacher]
against another.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul in the opening chapters of 1 Corinthians is speaking against
the factions that had developed in the Corinthian church. These
factions were formed around various teachers, like Paul himself,
Apollos and Peter (1 Cor 1:12, 3:4). Each faction exalted itself in
pride because of who their favorite teacher was. Paul using himself as
an example asks - "was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in
the name of Paul?" (1 Cor 1:13). Paul is making the point here that it
is the message of "Jesus Christ, and him crucified" that matters (1 Cor
2:2), but not who it was that brought you that message. Paul himself
taught the basics, or "milk" of the Gospel (1 Cor 3:2), while Apollos
built on what Paul had taught, at a higher level of understanding (1
Cor 3:6). In both cases though, it was God who gave understanding (1
Cor 3:7), not Paul or Apollos. So Paul says (1 Cor 3:21-22) "let no man
glory in men. For all things are yours; whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas (Peter) ... ." The point he is making is that scripture does not
teach one to be a disciple of Paul, or Apollos, or Peter, but rather a
disciple of Jesus Christ, whom all the prophets and apostles preached
about.</p>
  <p>So when Paul says "not to go beyond that which is written," he
makes quite clear that the <em>written</em> scriptures are the
limiting factor. <b><em> This is Sola Scriptura in verity.</em></b>
Paul is teaching unity in the truths of the Gospel message as found in
scripture, which teaches Jesus Christ as the Saviour and foundation (1
Cor 3:11), but he is criticizing divisive factions in the church based
on individual disciples. The warning is not to build teachings,
doctrines, or dogma that go beyond the teaching of scriptures and exalt
anyone other than Christ. The church that exalts one disciple over
another, and so divides the body of Christ, is described by Paul as
being <em> carnal</em> rather than spiritual (1 Cor 3:4). Does this
not then describe a church that calls Peter the preeminent apostle, and
presumes to trace itself all the way back to Peter via the Tradition of
apostolic succession? This is <em>precisely</em> what Paul is warning
against.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 11:3 But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted, and fall from the
simplicity that is in Christ. <i><br>
    </i>2 Cor 11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom

  <p>From the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent
beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted

  </blockquote>
  <p>So here, up to this point, are no less than fourteen different
passages found in both the Old Testament and the New Testament that
collectively establish the principle of Sola Scriptura, the authority
of scripture alone to discern truth and instruct one in a saving faith
in Jesus Christ. What then of Catholic Tradition? What of the dogmas of
the apostolic succession, the immaculate conception of Mary, her
assumption into heaven, her role as mediatrix of God's grace and the
many other such unbiblical Catholic Traditions? What bearing do they
really have on salvation?</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><em><b>FIF</b></em><b><em>TEENTH CITATION</em></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>From the <b>1899 revised Douay Rheims</b>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:6 I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that
called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.<br>
Gal 1:7 Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and
would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you
besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>From the <b>King James:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that
called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and
would pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
Gal 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any
other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The gospel message as preached by Paul, and as recorded faithfully
in the scriptures, is pure and remains sufficient to salvation. No
doctrine or Tradition needs to be added to what Paul taught the early
Christians. In fact, Paul condemns anyone who would teach a gospel
other that what he had presented, which was the whole counsel of God..</p>
  <p><u><b>Conclusion</b></u></p>
  <p>Clearly Sola Scriptura stands as biblically taught truth. The
decrees and pronouncements called "Tradition" by the Roman Catholic
Church, which cannot be found in scripture, are therefore rightly
defined as that "other gospel" that Paul spoke of.</p>
  <p>So let those who teach that other gospel take solemn note of
Paul's warning.</p>
