<title>Pope Benedict XVI: Teaching A Perverted Gpspel</title>

  <p align="center"><font size="6">Pope Benedict XVI:<br>
  </font><font size="5">Teaching A Perverted Gospel</font></p>
  <i><hr></i>
  <p align="left">For his Angelus message of <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/angelus/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_ang_20070815_assunzione_en.html">August 15th, 2007</a>, 
  Benedict XVI made the following assertion:</p>

            <p align="left"><i>Dear Brothers and Sisters,</i></p>
            <p align="left">Today, we are celebrating the Solemnity of the 
            Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is an ancient feast 
            deeply rooted in Sacred Scripture: indeed, it presents the Virgin 
            Mary closely united to her divine Son and ever supportive of him.
            </p>
        
        </center>
        
                     <p align="left">Mother and Son appear closely bound in the fight 
            against the infernal enemy until they completely defeat him. This 
            victory is expressed in particular in overcoming sin and death, that 
            is, in triumphing over the enemies which St Paul always presents as 
            connected (cf. Rom 5: 12, 15-21; I Cor 15: 21-26). </p>
            <p align="left">Therefore, just as Christ's glorious Resurrection 
            was the definitive sign of this victory, so Mary's glorification in 
            her virginal body is the ultimate confirmation of her total 
            solidarity with the Son, both in the conflict and in victory. ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Scripture is utterly silent about the end of Mary's 
  life. There is absolutely no mention of her death or burial, much less her 
  alleged glorious assumption into heaven. Yet we are told that this infallible
  <i>de fide</i> doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church is &quot;deeply rooted in 
  Sacred Scripture: ...&quot;,&nbsp; yet the only scripture cited does not even mention 
  Mary, or her being &quot;closely bound [with her Son] in the fight against the 
  infernal enemy until they completely defeat him.&quot; How can scripture be 
  completely devoid of any such teaching, yet be boldly declared the &quot;ultimate 
  confirmation&quot;, asserted to be &quot;deeply rooted in Sacred Scripture&quot;? Benedict XVI continues:</p>

    <p align="left">The Servant of God Pope Pius XII interpreted the deep 
    theological meaning of this mystery on 1 November 1950 when he pronounced 
    the solemn Dogmatic Definition of this Marian privilege. </p>
    <p align="left">He declared: &quot;Hence, the revered Mother of God, from all 
    eternity joined in a hidden way with Jesus Christ in one and the same decree 
    of predestination, immaculate in her conception, a most perfect virgin in 
    her divine motherhood, the noble associate of the divine Redeemer who has 
    won a complete triumph over sin and its consequences, finally obtained, as 
    the supreme culmination of her privileges, that she should be preserved free 
    from the corruption of the tomb and that, like her own Son, having overcome 
    death, she might be taken up body and soul to the glory of Heaven where, as 
    Queen, she sits in splendour at the right hand of her Son, the immortal King 
    of the Ages&quot; (Apostolic Constitution<i><b> </b>

    Munificentissimus Deus</a></i>: AAS 42, [1 November 1950]). </p>
    <p align="left">Dear brothers and sisters, after being taken up into Heaven, 
    Mary did not distance herself from us but continues to be even closer to us 
    and her light shines on our lives and on the history of all humanity. 
    Attracted by the heavenly brightness of the Mother of the Redeemer, let us 
    turn with trust to the One who looks upon us and protects us from on high.
    </p>
    <p align="left">We all need her help and comfort to face the trials and 
    challenges of daily life; we need to feel that she is our mother and sister 
    in the concrete situations of our lives. </p>
    <p align="left">And so that we too may one day be able to share in her same 
    destiny, let us imitate her now in her meek following of Christ and her 
    generous service to the brethren. This is the only way to have a foretaste, 
    already on our earthly pilgrimage, of the joy and peace which those who 
    reach the immortal destination of Paradise live to the full. </p>

  <p>That is blasphemy, idolatry and Antichrist. It is an outright lie, a 
  corrupt tradition of men, a doctrine of demons, a perversion of the Gospel 
  never taught by scripture, but condemned in the <i>strongest</i> terms:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you 
    into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:<br>
    Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would 
    pervert the gospel of Christ.<br>
    Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto 
    you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.<br>
    Gal 1:9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other 
    gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
