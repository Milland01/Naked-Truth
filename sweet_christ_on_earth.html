  <p align="left">There are currently at least <i>five</i> documents on the 
  Vatican web site that use the blasphemous phrase &quot;sweet Christ on earth&quot; to 
  describe the Pope-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">46. ... In founders and foundresses we see a constant and 
    lively sense of the Church, which they manifest by their full participation 
    in all aspects of the Church's life, and in their ready obedience to the 
    Bishops and especially to the Roman Pontiff. Against this background of love 
    towards Holy Church, &quot;the pillar and bulwark of the truth&quot; (1 Tim 3:15), we 
    readily understand the devotion of Saint Francis of Assisi for
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&quot;the Lord Pope&quot;</span>, the 
    daughterly outspokenness of Saint Catherine of Siena towards the one whom 
    she called <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&quot;sweet Christ on earth&quot;</span>, 
    the apostolic obedience and the sentire cum Ecclesia of Saint Ignatius 
    Loyola, and the joyful profession of faith made by Saint Teresa of Avila: &quot;I 
    am a daughter of the Church&quot;. ...</p>

    demanding of them the most exacting integrity in their personal lives and 
    their pastoral ministry. The uninhibited, powerful and incisive tone in 
    which she admonished priests, Bishops and Cardinals is quite striking. It is 
    essential — she would say — to root out from the garden of the Church the 
    rotten plants and to put in their place “new plants” which are fresh and 
    fragrant. And strengthened by her intimacy with Christ, the Saint of Siena 
    was not afraid to point out frankly even to the Pope, whom she loved dearly 
    as her <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">“sweet Christ on earth”</span>, 
    that the will of God demanded that he should abandon the hesitation born of 
    earthly prudence and worldly interests, and return from Avignon to Rome, to 
    the Tomb of Peter. ...</p>

    Catherine of Siena defines as &quot;Ministers of the Blood of Christ&quot;, in this

    Apostle Peter and his successors the key of His Blood, from which all the 
    Sacraments gain life. The Pope, with ardent faith recognized by Catherine as
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&quot;sweet Christ on earth&quot;</span> and 
    called with tender affection &quot;My kindest daddy&quot; is asked to work strongly

    rejoice, because by love you have restored the sheep to the fold of Holy 
    Church. And then, sweet my father, you will fulfill your holy desire and the 
    will of God by starting the holy Crusade, which I summon you in his name to 
    do swiftly and without negligence. They will turn to it with great

    <p>... How great then was the saint’s respect and passionate love for the 
    Roman Pontiff! Today, we personally, the lowest servant of the servants of 
    God, owe an immense recognition to Catherine, not indeed for the honor that 
    might redound to our humble person, but for the mystical apology she made of 
    the apostolic office of the successor of Peter. Who can forget it? She saw 
    in him &quot;<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">the sweet Christ on earth</span>,&quot; 
    to whom is owed filial love and obedience, because, &quot;He who will be 
    disobedient to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Christ on earth, who 
    stands in the stead of Christ in heaven</span>, will not share in the fruit 
    of the blood of the Son of God.&quot; And, anticipating not only the teaching but 
    the very language of Vatican II, the Saint wrote to Pope Urban VI, &quot;Most 
    holy Father . . . know the great necessity that you and the holy Church have 
    to preserve this people (of Florence) in obedience and reverence to Your 
    Holiness, for he is the head and principle of our faith.&quot; ...</p>
