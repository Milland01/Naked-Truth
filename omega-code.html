          <strong><a href="http://www.theomegacode.com/">The Omega Code</a></strong>,
          </em>which is being promoted and endorsed by some in the Protestant
          community as an evangelistic tool to introduce non-believers and
          neophyte Christians to Bible prophecy as it relates to the Antichrist
          and the end times.</p>
          <p>According to the movie's theme, a secret code is discovered in the
          Torah (the first five books of the Bible), and whoever possesses this
          decoded secret is in position to take control of the world. In the
          story of the movie, Michael York plays the part of Stone Alexander,
          the Chairman of the European Union, who becomes power-crazed and is
          ultimately declared Chancellor of a United World, a portrayal of the
          Antichrist figure of scripture. Casper Van Dien portrays Dr. Gillen
          Lane, a world famous motivational speaker with a degree in religion
          and mythology from Cambridge, who is apparently depicting the False
          Prophet of Revelation (the movie is basically told from the viewpoint
          of Dr. Lane).</p>

  <p>The part of Cassandra Barris, played by Catherine Oxenberg, is that of a
  network news reporter who secretly works for Stone Alexander. (It's not a
  secret to those who happen to notice an Alexander Network TV van in the first
  few minutes of the film.) Michael Ironside plays Stone Alexander's 2nd in
  command and hitman, Dominic, a former Catholic priest who feels threatened by
  the hiring of Dr. Gillen Lane as the new &quot;prophet&quot; of Stone
  Alexander. Dominic ultimately delivers the fatal &quot;head wound&quot; to his
  &quot;antichrist&quot; boss by accident, while trying to off Dr. Lane, who had
  just discovered the stolen Bible codes. This briefly allows Dominic to assume
  control of the organization, until Stone Alexander (the Antichrist) is
  miraculously resurrected from the dead, and indwelt by Satan himself.</p>
  <p>The release of a movie like this from a well known television ministry has
  to prompt the question, how faithful is it to the Bible? Does it, in principle
  at least, accurately portray events that the word of God predicts, even if
  fictionalized to some degree? Supposedly, prophecy &quot;expert&quot; and
  author Hal Lindsey has insured the fidelity of the prophetic portion of the
  film with the scriptures, although he is the one and only Bible authority
  credited as a consultant to the film.</p>
  <p><u><b>Where's the beef?</b></u></p>
  <p>Here is an example of what was claimed for <i>The Omega Code</i> before it
  opened to the public:</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="16" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#DDEEFF"
    width="80%">
      <tr>
        <td>... &quot;there’s enough gospel in this movie that if you bring an
          unsaved loved one, it really is a powerful witnessing tool to opening
          up questions about the End Time, about Revelation, and that’s what
          we’re hoping Christians will do. It’s easy, as a Christian -- you
          can get a neighbor or unsaved person into a theater; they may never
          darken the door of a church, but you can get them into a movie
          theater. We’re hoping that Christians will use this as a witnessing
          tool.&quot;&nbsp; -- Quote of Paul F. Crouch Jr. in an <a
          href="http://www.cbn.org/living/ae/entertainment/omegacode.asp">interview
          with Pat Robertson</a> on the 700 Club.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>Although promoted as a tool for witnessing the Gospel, there is very little
  religion of <i>any</i> kind in this film, the name of Jesus being mentioned in
  a positive way only once, when Dr. Lane, a self-described unbeliever, prays
  very briefly (God, Jesus save me!) in a moment of desperation and apparent
  danger. If Dr. Lane is converted, it is not developed any further in the
  story. Nowhere in the film is the Gospel (salvation through faith in Jesus
  Christ) explained, and neither is there a character that can be described
  throughout the film as a true Christian. Scripture is quoted or alluded to
  only a few times, but not in any way that explains the Gospel, and no specific
  references are given, so when it <i>is</i> quoted, those not familiar with the
  Bible will probably not know it, much less the chapter and verse being quoted.
  In fact, it would be difficult to produce a more secularized (non-religious)
  movie about Bible prophecy. As a result, non-Christians unfamiliar with Bible
  prophecy are not likely to understand how the movie relates to scripture, and
  many Christians may be similarly confused by what they see (or don't see) in
  the film.</p>
  <p>I can't help but feel that some people that went out and bought hundreds of
  tickets in advance, to distribute for the purposes of evangelism, will feel
  they have been played for suckers, and their money totally wasted on a film
  essentially devoid of any Christian message. In fact, it is hard not to label
  this movie as nothing more than a crass attempt by TBN at gambling with
  donated money, hoping to hit the big time and rake in millions of dollars by
  luring their large television audience to attend and bring their friends,
  while making a secular guns and violence &quot;thriller&quot; that would still
  appeal to unbelievers. The PG-13 rating is merited because five people are
  shot to death, there are two terrorist bombings, two attempted assassinations
  of Dr. Lane (one a SWAT team break-in with machineguns blazing), two chase
  sequences with vehicles, an imminent nuclear military attack on Israel, and
  the destruction of Rome, which ends the film. Bottom line, you should <i>see</i>
  the movie <i>before</i> buying large blocks of tickets and promoting it to
  your unsaved friends. That way you will not feel &quot;burned&quot; by TBN, or
  anyone else who promoted the film as a way of witnessing for the Gospel.</p>
  <p>In addition, the subject of the secret rapture, which is widely believed in
  Protestantism and is the topic of a recent book by Hal Lindsey, is curiously
  not even mentioned or depicted in <i>The Omega Code</i>. Also totally absent
  from the film are the number 666, the mark of the beast, the seal of God,
  miracles performed by the False Prophet (such as calling down fire from
  heaven), apostasy in the church, persecution of true Christians, and the
  prohibition of buying and selling imposed on the true people of God who refuse
  to take the mark of the beast.</p>
  <p>With all that is <i>missing</i> from this film, you might ask, what <i>IS</i>
  in <i>The Omega Code</i>? Good question! Boil down what little there is and
  the major points of this movie are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Antichrist is a charismatic Hitler-like character that has not
      appeared yet, but will in the near future.</li>
    <li>The Antichrist will lead a revived Roman Empire and be involved in a 7
      year peace treaty signed with Israel.</li>
    <li>The temple of Solomon will be rebuilt after the Arab Dome of the Rock on
      temple mount is destroyed. (In the movie, the Dome of the Rock is also
      rebuilt).</li>
    <li>The 70th week of Daniel (a seven year period) will begin with the
      signing of the seven year treaty between the Arabs and Israel, ending the
      war that began with the destruction of the Dome of the Rock and a Jewish
      synagogue.</li>
    <li>The Antichrist suffers a fatal head wound, from which he is miraculously
      resurrected, and the world wonders and follows him.</li>
    <li>Three and a half years into the treaty, the Antichrist is exposed for
      what he really is when he declares himself to be God on the temple mount
      in Jerusalem.</li>
    <li>Precisely seven years after the treaty signing, the millennial reign of
      Christ begins (this is where the movie ends, <i>without</i> even depicting
      the second coming of Jesus).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b><u>Futurism, Preterism, and Historicism.</u></b></p>
  <p>The above scenario of <i>The Omega Code</i> can be classified under the
  category of <em>Futurism</em>, and is called such because it is based on a yet
  future fulfillment of the Antichrist of prophecy and the 70th week of Daniel
  (Dan 9:24-27). There are two other schools of prophecy that have to be
  considered. <em>Preterism</em>, which assumes that the Book of Revelation (and
  prophecy in general) was written for and to the first century church, and has
  little if any application to current or future events, the Antichrist most
  likely being Caesar Nero of pagan Rome. Then there is the school of <em>Historicism</em>,
  which applies Revelation to the period beginning in the first century but
  extending all the way to the second coming of Christ, during 1260 years of
  which, the Antichrist reigned over Europe from Rome.</p>
  <p>During the Reformation, when scripture was exploding off the Protestant
  printing presses in the common tongue, instead of Latin, it became apparent to
  students of Bible prophecy that the Antichrist beast and apostate Mystery
  Babylon of the books of Daniel and Revelation was <em>already</em> on the
  scene, and <em>had been for over a thousand years</em>! Because of their Bible
  study, John Wycliff, John Hus, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, Philipp
  Melanchthon, John Calvin, John Knox, Huldreich Zwingli, and John Wesley all
  identified the Papacy of the Roman Catholic Church as the Antichrist power and
  apostate Mystery Babylon, as did many others. If the giants of the Reformation
  came to this conclusion, some even being burned at the stake for their belief,
  then when and how did Protestantism abandon the Historicist interpretation and
  adopt Futurism, where the Antichrist is some unknown unidentified figure off
  in the future?</p>
  <p>Briefly, both Preterism and Futurism were concocted by Jesuit priests
  during the Reformation in order to take the heat off of the Catholic Church
  and counter the Historicist interpretation put forth by the heretical
  Protestants. Particularly in the last 100 years or so, the Catholic Futurist
  interpretation has gradually taken hold in Protestantism, and one of its main
  proponents for the last 20 years or so has been Hal Lindsey, who has appeared
  frequently on TBN, which airs his weekly prophecy program.</p>
  <p>So the basic theme of TBN's movie <em>The Omega Code</em> represents an
  utter abandonment of the historical Protestant view of prophecy, and an
  endorsement of the Jesuit Futurist interpretation that was invented
  specifically by the Roman Catholic Church to counter the stinging accusations
  of the Reformers that the little horn of Daniel, the Antichrist, and the woman
  riding the beast in Revelation all referred to Popery and Roman Catholicism. <font
  color="#000000">Also of note, on Sunday, October 31st, Reformation day, an
  agreement was signed by that same Antichrist power with the vast majority of
  Lutherans, effectively ending the centuries old dispute over justification by
  faith!</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 8:25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
    his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and <em><strong>by
    peace</strong></em> shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
    Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Interestingly enough, the <em>False Prophet</em> of Revelation can be
  demonstrated to be none other than apostate <em>Protestantism</em> based in
  the United States, that will fully support the Antichrist Catholic Church,
  even to the point of enforcing its mark of authority by force of law.</p>

  <p>I extended an invitation for someone at Trinity Broadcasting Network to
  respond to the above review, and the following was graciously sent by Paul
  Crouch Jr. on October 25th, on behalf of TBN.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>We never intended &quot;The Omega Code&quot; to be a literal
          interpretation of the book of Daniel or Revelation. To really bring
          the whole of the 70th week of Daniel to the screen would have cost 100
          million dollars or more. (We wanted to originally do a movie like
          this, but was way out of our budget.) We simply took some of the
          highlights of prophecy and end times and put it into a dramatized
          story. This is simply a tool to open up discussion with unsaved people
          about the Bible and where we go when we die. It was not meant to open
          up philosophical diatribe between people who are supposedly on the
          same side! (It seems that believers are the first ones to shoot their
          wounded, and I don't know why that is?) Also, we wanted to represent
          that ultimately good wins over evil. None of us, if we're truly
          honest, know exactly how end times will play out. Our story, with the
          limited screen time and limited budget, represented one possibility.
          Yes, there were many things left out, (i.e., The Mark of the Beast,
          666, The persecution of Christians, etc.) There have been other movies
          like that done, and we didn't even want to go there. At least not yet!
          This movie is a stepping stone for us, we had to start somewhere, and
          this is just a beginning. If Christians want better movies produced,
          then we must prove to Hollywood we'll support projects with a
          Christian message. You apparently didn't see much Christian message in
          this film, but we've been equally criticized for too much evangelism
          and the fact that it is anti-Catholic. Go figure? (With your obvious
          opinions on Catholics I thought you would have at least praised that
          part of the story!)
          <p>This movie was not made to simply &quot;preach to the choir&quot;,
          we do that enough. We wanted it to have some secular appeal and it
          has. Our numbers per screen have been fabulous!! The first weekend we
          were #1 and this past weekend we were #2. It's easy to sit back and
          criticize things we don't like, Christians tend to curse the darkness
          as opposed to lighting a candle. It's unbelievably difficult to bring
          even a simple movie like this to the screen. All I can say is &quot;we
          tried&quot;, and this was our attempt to &quot;light a candle.&quot;
          We wanted it to be better also, but our resources were limited.</p>
          <p>The good news for all Christians is that they have spoken! Our box
          office returns are unbelievable! We at TBN are going to invade
          Hollywood and raise the standard for Christian films done now and in
          the future!</p>
          <p>Hope this helps,<br>
          Paul Crouch Jr.<br>
          TBN VP of Production</p>
          <p>(You should see the review done by Focus on the Family<br>

  <p>It is indeed unfortunate that TBN decided to make nothing more than an
  entertaining movie for the unchurched, and that it was never intended to
  accurately depict and teach end time events or present the Gospel message of
  salvation. As a result, <i>The Omega Code, </i>sadly, does not &quot;light a
  candle&quot; as claimed above. While it may well provoke discussions, that is
  likely because of the confusion it generates about prophecy among both
  believers and non-believers alike. Its evangelistic value is minimal, or even
  non-existent, compared to what it could have been.</p>
  <p>I would disagree strongly on another point. We can indeed know for certain
  what events face us in the future, as that is the <i>exact</i> purpose of
  prophecy. For the Historical biblical Protestant truth about the Antichrist
  and False Prophet, see:</p>

  <p>Questions about the film that Paul Crouch Jr. has also answered:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When does the dream sequence of Dr. Lane start?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The whole scene in the tunnel was a dream. He was found
  passed out in the street by Cassandra shortly after he fled from the Senator's
  house.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why does Dr. Lane say &quot;forgive me&quot; as he
  enters the final code into the computer?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He's asking God to forgive him for what he's about to
  do.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. The attack at the end is apparently on Israel or the
  Middle East, but the big explosion is in Rome. Why? Is that a result of
  entering the final code?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The final scene was not an explosion!! It was the light
  of God cleansing the world of evil. It blew the devil out of Stone and left
  Lane untouched. Had it been a bomb, everything would be blown to bits! The
  light then traveled around the earth to cleanse the rest of the world! This
  could also fall in line with the second coming of Christ, we leave this up to
  the viewer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the purpose/meaning of the Catholic
  monstrance in the final moments of the movie (the gold sunburst looking thing
  used to display the wafer) which is in front of Dr. Lane?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It was something someone had given to my Dad. It
  normally sits in his office, and we thought it looked cool! Nothing more,
  nothing less. There is no hidden symbolism other than he is headquartered in
  Rome. Maybe Dominic gave it to him? Take your pick.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What's the significance of the visions/flashbacks of
  Dr. Lane?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He was seeing his mother, the ambulance she died in,
  kneeling at her grave, and him rejecting Christ by throwing away his cross.</p>
