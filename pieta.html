        <p>Possibly the most famous rendering of Mary and Jesus is the Pietà of 
        Michelangelo in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. The youthful looking 
        Mary is portrayed as seated, holding her dead Son across her lap, and 
        rather than an expression of grief, Mary has an almost serene expression 
        of resignation.</p>

  <p>While it portrays what would clearly be a poignant moment, the Bible never 
  mentions such a moment as having ever taken place. In the Gospel accounts, it 
  is Joseph of Arimathaea who claimed the body of Jesus, prepared it for burial, 
  and then laid it in the tomb- </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Matthew 27:57-61</li>
    <li>Mark 15:42-47</li>
    <li>Luke 23:50-56</li>
    <li>John 19:38-42</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Had this scene actually happened as portrayed in the Pietà, Mary would have 
  been considered unclean for seven days as a result of touching a dead body, as 
  the book of Numbers explains-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Num 19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean 
    seven days.<br>
    Num 19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the 
    seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, 
    then the seventh day he shall not be clean.<br>
    Num 19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and 
    purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul 
    shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not 
    sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Surely the thought of the &quot;immaculate&quot; Mary being declared unclean for a 
  week is anathema to the Catholic mind. So, why illustrate a scene that 
  apparently never happened?</p>

        <p>Here is another sculpture by Michelangelo known as the Brugges Pietà 
        depicting Mary with Jesus as a child. The theme of Michelangelo's Pietà 
        is a common one in Catholic imagery because, in my opinion, it evokes 
        pity and empathy for Mary, the loving &quot;mother of the church&quot; that 
        willingly endured the death of her firstborn son for the sake of the 
        sins of the world.</p>
        <p>This kind of symbolic imagery portrays Mary as an authority figure 
        that is subtly superior to that of her dependent child or dead son. The 
        implication is that had it not been for the consent and assistance of 
        Mary, the redemption of humanity would have been impossible, and God's 
        plan of salvation would have <em>failed.</em></p>

        <p>More recently there seem to be more statues or paintings of Mary, 
        some associated with alleged apparitions, that are the focus of Catholic 
        attention because they are claimed to miraculously weep tears or bleed.

        The veneration of these images of Mary has increased dramatically over 
        the last century, as a direct result of the increasing emphasis the 
        church has placed on Marian dogma, proclaimed &quot;infallibly&quot; (ex-cathedra) 
        by the Papacy. The weeping icon shown here is in the Anticion Orthodox 
        Church of Cicero Illinois.</p>

        <p>Here you see the Weeping Madonna of Syracuse Sicily. In 1953, when 
        first discovered to be weeping, this plaster sculpture of Mary was 
        examined by the Catholic Church, which tested the tears scientifically 
        and quickly approved it as a genuine miracle of God. It's veneration and 
        display has been approved by no less than three popes, with a church, 
        the <em>Santuario della Madonna delle Lacrime</em>, being built 
        specifically for the veneration of this piece of plaster. Pope John Paul 
        II himself consecrated the church during a visit to Syracuse in November 
        of 1994.</p>

  <p>Shrines like that of the Weeping Madonna of Syracuse Sicily are the 
  inevitable result of these weeping or bleeding images, with literally 
  thousands of Catholics on pilgrimage kneeling before the statues or icons as 
  they pray to Mary for healing or for her intercession, and endlessly reciting 
  the decades of the Rosary. Catholics claiming miracles directly attributed to 
  these images of Mary or Jesus are legion, and have practically become a staple 
  of the Catholic faith.</p>

        weeping, bleeding, sweating and talking statues of Mary, in <nobr>Akita

  <p>But most astonishing of all, <b><em>Mary is shown as if she is on the 
  cross!</em></b> The symbolism of this statue is quite unmistakable in it's 
  meaning. It is blasphemy of the highest order and clearly AntiChrist, openly 
  substituting Mary as the one to look for forgiveness and redemption, instead 
  of Jesus Christ. Note this message attributed to the apparition of Mary 
  associated with this statue:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Pray very much the prayers of the Rosary. I alone am able still to save 
    you from the calamites which approach. Those who place their confidence in 
    me will be saved.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here is a web page revealing the source of the above statue's symbology, 
  which is linked to declaring Mary the Co-Redemptrix of the human race: <b>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ladyofallnations.org/">The Lady of All Nations.</a></p>
  </b>
  <p>And note this web page at Queenship Publishing promoting a book on this 
  &quot;miracle&quot; that declares- <nobr><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <b>
  <a href="http://www.queenship.org/productdetails.cfm?PC=5625">Akita: Mother of 
  God as Co-Redemptrix!</a></b></nobr></p>
  <p>Here is the home page of <nobr><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <b><a href="http://www.queenship.org/">Queenship Publishing,</a> </b></nobr>
  which is also seeking to have Mary's title of Co-Redemptrix be declared as 
  binding dogma (See Vox Populi).</p>
  <p>Roman Catholics would maintain that statues and icons of this sort actually 
  aid the process of worshipping God. The truth though, is that the Bible is 
  quite specific in it's complete prohibition of bowing down before these kind 
  of graven images because it is nothing short of <b><em>idolatry</em></b>, 
  which is very <b><em>strongly</em></b> condemned by God:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven (carved) image, or any 
    likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth 
    beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 <b>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them</b>, nor serve them: for 
    I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, ...</p>
    <p>Deu 12:2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations 
    which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon 
    the hills, and under every green tree:<br>
    Deu 12:3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and 
    burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of 
    their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.<br>
    Deu 12:4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What could more clear than that? If God himself condemns these idols in no 
  uncertain terms, then <em><b>none</b></em> of the messages or miraculous 
  events attributed to these idols or apparitions can possibly be from God. Just 
  what does that leave you with? They are either outright fraud, or they are 
  Satanic - there is no other choice. Catholics might as well be making and 
  venerating golden calves! It will do them just as much good in the eyes of 
  God.</p>
