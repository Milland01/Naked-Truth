<blockquote>
  <p>Albert of Brandenburg (Hohenzollern) Germany (1490 -1545) became bishop of
  Magdeburg in 1513 and Archbishop of Mainz in 1514. In doing so, Albert
  unknowingly laid the groundwork for the Reformation. Albert at the time was
  only 24 years of age, way below the prescribed age for a bishop. A papal
  dispensation was required, along with a large payment, to acquire the high
  ecclesiastical offices. (This practice of selling a church office is called
  simony, and originates from Acts 8:18-24.) Needing 24,000 ducats to pay Pope
  Leo X in exchange for the title of Archbishop of Mainz, Albert borrowed the
  money from a south German banking house (The Fuggers), and then set about to
  pay back the loan. To raise the necessary funds, Archbishop Albert promoted
  the sale of indulgences for the rebuilding of St. Peter's in Rome. Half the
  collected funds went to Rome for the building of St. Peter's and half went
  into Albert's pocket. Johann Tetzel, a Dominican monk employed by Albert, sold
  these indulgences in Germany, prompting Martin Luther to write his disputation
  in 95 thesis which he posted to the door of Wittenberg Castle Church (a copy
  of which he also sent to Archbishop Albert), on the 31st of October 1517, thus
  sparking the Reformation.</p>
  <p>Martin Luther's <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <strong><a

  letter to Archbishop Albert </a></strong>is online at the Internet Medieval
  Sourcebook.
  <p>Also of note, Leo X on his election as pope spent 100,000 ducats on his
  inauguration festival (1/7th of the Vatican treasury) and soon depleted the
  rest of the church's money on various forms of entertainment and parties. He
  was such a big spender that he was soon forced to borrow money from bankers at
  a 40% rate of interest. To help remedy the situation he also sold indulgences
  and church offices, even creating 30 new cardinals in 1517, which alone
  yielded some 500,000 ducats for the coffers. So Archbishop Albert was clearly
  following the lead of the pontiff in offering forgiveness for a price.
  <p>What follows are the instructions issued by Archbishop Albert that
  authorized the sale of these indulgences in Germany:</p>
  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Albert, by the grace of God and the Apostolic Chair, Archbishop of
    Magdeburg and Mainz, Primate and Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire in
    Germany, Elector, Administrator of the Churches in Halberstadt, Margrave in
    Brandenburg, Duke of Stettin, etc.</p>
    <p>To all who read this letter: Salvation in the Lord.
    <p>We do herewith proclaim that our most holy Lord Leo X, by divine
    providence present Pontiff, has given and bestowed to all Christian
    believers of either sex who lend their helpful hand for the reconstruction
    of the cathedral church of St. Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, in Rome,
    complete indulgence as well as other graces and freedoms, which the
    Christian believer may obtain according to the apostolic letter dealing with
    this matter. . . .
    <p>Here follow the four principal graces granted in the apostolic bull.
    These can be obtained separately. Utmost industriousness should be exercised
    in order to commend each grace most emphatically to the faithful. . . .
    <p>The first grace is the complete remission of all sins. Nothing can be
    greater than this grace, since man, living in sin and deprived of divine
    grace, obtains complete forgiveness by these means and enjoys anew the grace
    of God. Moreover, through such forgiveness of sins the punishment which one
    is obliged to undergo in purgatory on account of the offence of the Divine
    Majesty is all remitted and the pain of purgatory is altogether done away
    with. And even though nothing satisfactory and worthy could be given in
    exchange for such a grace - since it is a gift of God and a grace beyond
    price - yet we decree the following rules in order that Christian believers
    may obtain it all the more easily:
    <p>In the first place: Everyone who is contrite in heart and has confessed
    with his mouth - or at least has the intention of confessing at a suitable
    time - shall visit the designated seven churches in which the papal coat of
    arms is displayed and pray in each church five devout Lord's Prayers and
    five <em>Ave Marias</em> in honor of the five wounds of our Lord Jesus
    Christ whereby our redemption took place, or one <em>Miserere</em> [Ps. 51],
    which psalm seems particularly appropriate to obtain forgiveness of sins. .
    . .
    <p>Where, however, persons are so weak that they could not easily come to
    such a church, their confessor or penitentiary should cause to be brought an
    altar to a suitable place according to his discretion. When such persons
    visit this place and offer their prayers near the altar or before, they
    shall receive the indulgence as though they had visited the seven churches.
    <p>Those on a sick bed are to be given a holy picture, before or near which
    they shall offer several prayers according to the decision of the confessor.
    Thus they shall receive the indulgence in this manner as though they had
    visited the seven churches. Wherever any person for a certain reason desires
    to be relieved of the necessity to visit said altars and churches, it may be
    granted him by the penitentiary. However, a larger amount will become
    necessary under such circumstances.
    <p>Concerning the contribution to the chest, for the building of said church
    of the chief of the apostles, the penitentiaries and the confessors are to
    ask those making confession, after having explained the full forgiveness and
    privilege of this indulgence: How much money or other temporal goods they
    would conscientiously give for such full forgiveness? This is to be done in
    order that afterwards they may be brought all the more easily to make a
    contribution. Because the conditions of men are many and diverse, it is not
    possible to establish a general fee. We have therefore fixed the following
    rates:
    <p>Kings, queens, and their sons, archbishops and bishops, and other great
    rulers should pay, upon presenting themselves to places where the cross is
    raised, twenty-five Rhenish guilders.
    <p>Abbots, prelates of cathedral churches, counts, barons, and others of the
    higher nobility and their wives shall pay for each letter of indulgence ten
    such gold guilders. Other lesser prelates and nobles, as also to the rectors
    of famous places, and all others who take in, either from steady income or
    goods or other means, 500 gold guilders should pay six guilders.
    <p>Other citizens and merchants, who ordinarily take in 200 such gold
    florins, should pay three florins.
    <p>Other citizens and merchants, and artisans, who have their families and
    income of their own, shall pay one such guilder; those of lesser means, pay
    only one half. . . .
    <p>But those who do not have any money should supply their contribution with
    prayer. For the kingdom of heaven should be open to the poor no less than to
    the rich.
    <p>Even though a wife cannot obtain from the property of her husband without
    his will, she can still dispose of her dowry or other property elsewhere,
    which enables her to contribute even against the will of her husband. Where
    she does not have anything or is hindered by her husband, she is to supply
    her contribution with prayer. This applies also to sons who are under
    paternal authority.
    <p>Where, however, poor wives and sons yet under paternal authority are able
    to beg or to receive gifts from the rich and devout persons, they are to put
    these contributions into the chest. If they have no opportunity to obtain
    the necessary amount, they may obtain said treasure of grace through prayer
    and intercession both for themselves and also for the dead.
    <p>. . . The second principle grace is a letter of indulgence, entailing the
    greatest, exceeding quickening and hitherto unheard of powers, which will
    continue beyond the eight years designated in the present bull. . . . The
    content of this letter shall be explained by the preachers and confessors to
    the best of their ability. . . .
    <p>The third principle grace is the participation in all the possessions of
    the Church universal; . . . contributors toward said building, together with
    their deceased relatives, who have departed this world in a state of grace,
    shall from now on, and for eternity, be partakers in all petitions,
    intercessions, alms, fastings, prayers, in each and every pilgrimage, even
    those to the Holy Land; furthermore, in the stations at Rome, in masses,
    canonical hours, flagellations, and all other spiritual goods which have
    been, or shall be, brought forth by the universal, most holy Church militant
    or by any of its members. Believers who purchase confessional letters may
    also become participants in all these things. Preachers and confessors must
    insist with great perseverance upon these advantages, and persuade believers
    not to neglect to acquire these benefits along with their confessional
    letter.
    <p>We also declare that in order to obtain these two most important graces,
    it is not necessary to make confession, or to visit the churches and altars,
    but merely to procure the confessional <nobr>letter. . . .</nobr>
    <p>The fourth distinctive grace is for those souls which are in purgatory,
    and is the complete remission of all sins, which remission the Pope brings
    to pass through his intercession, to the advantage of said souls, in this
    wise: that the same contribution shall be placed in the chest by a living
    person as one would make for himself. It is our wish, however, that our
    subcommissioners should modify the regulations regarding contributions of
    this kind which are given for the dead, and that they should use their
    judgment in all other cases, where, in their opinion, modifications are
    desirable.
    <p>It is, furthermore, not necessary that the persons who place their
    contributions in the chest for the dead should be contrite in heart and have
    orally confessed, since this grace is based simply on the state of grace in
    which the dead departed, and on the contribution of the living, as is
    evident from the text of the bull. Moreover, preachers shall exert
    themselves to give this grace the widest publicity, since through the same,
    help will surely come to departed souls, and the construction of the church
    of St. Peter will be abundantly promoted at the same time. . . .
