ON THE REUNION OF CHRISTENDOM, JUNE 20, 1894. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The splendid tokens of public rejoicing which have come 
  to Us from all sides in the whole course of last year, to commemorate Our 
  Episcopal Jubilee, and which were lately crowned by the remarkable devotion of 
  the Spanish nation, have afforded Us special joy, inasmuch as the unity of the 
  Church and the admirable adhesion of her members to the Sovereign Pontiff have 
  shone forth in this perfect agreement of concurring sentiments. During those 
  days it seemed as if the Catholic world, forgetful of everything else, had 
  centered its gaze and all its thoughts upon the Vatican. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The special missions sent by kings and princes, the many 
  pilgrimages, the letters We received so full of affectionate feeling, the 
  sacred services—everything clearly brought out the fact that all Catholics are 
  of one mind and of one heart in their veneration for the Apostolic See. And 
  this was all the more pleasing and agreeable to Us, that it is entirely in 
  conformity with Our intent and with Our endeavors. For, indeed, well 
  acquainted with Our times, and mindful of the duties of Our ministry, We have 
  constantly sought during the whole course of Our Pontificate and striven, as 
  far as it was possible, by teaching and action, to bind every nation and 
  people more closely to Us, and make manifest everywhere the salutary influence 
  of the See of Rome. Therefore do We most earnestly offer thanks in the first 
  place to the goodness of God, by whose help and bounty We have been preserved 
  to attain Our great age; and then next, to all the princes and rulers, to the 
  bishops and clergy, and to as many as have cooperated by such repeated tokens 
  of piety and reverence to honor Our character and office, while affording Us 
  personally such seasonable consolation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great deal, however, has been wanting to the entire 
  fullness of that consolation. Amidst these very manifestations of public joy 
  and reverence Our thoughts went out towards the immense multitude of those who 
  are strangers to the gladness that filled all Catholic hearts: some because 
  they lie in absolute ignorance of the Gospel; others because they dissent from 
  the Catholic belief, though they bear the same name of Christians. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This thought has been, and is, a source of deep concern to 
  Us; for it is impossible to think of such a large portion of mankind 
  deviating, as it were, from the right path, as they move away from Us, and not 
  experience a sentiment of innermost grief. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But since We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty, 
  who will have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth, 
  and now that Our advanced age and the bitterness of anxious cares urge Us on 
  towards the end common to every mortal, We feel drawn to follow the example of 
  Our Redeemer and Master, Jesus Christ, who when about to return to heaven, 
  implored of God, His Father, in earnest prayer, that His disciples and 
  followers should be of one mind and of one heart: <i>I pray ... that they all 
  may be one, as thou Father in Me, and I in Thee: that they also may be one in 
  Us.</i> And as this divine prayer and supplication does not include only the 
  souls who then believed in Jesus Christ, but also every one of those who were 
  henceforth to believe in Him, this prayer holds out to Us no indifferent 
  reason for confidently expressing Our hopes, and for making all possible 
  endeavors in order that the men of every race and clime should be called and 
  moved to embrace the unity of divine faith. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pressed on to Our intent by charity, that hastens fastest 
  there where the need is greatest, We direct Our first thoughts to those most 
  unfortunate of all nations who have never received the light of the Gospel, or 
  who, after having possessed it, have lost it through neglect or the 
  vicissitudes of time: hence do they ignore God, and live in the depths of 
  error. Now, as all salvation comes from Jesus Christ—for there is no other 
  name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved—Our ardent desire is 
  that the most holy name of Jesus should rapidly pervade and fill every land.
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here, indeed, is a duty which the Church, faithful to the 
  divine mission entrusted to her, has never neglected. What has been the object 
  of her labors for more than nineteen centuries? Is there any other work she 
  has undertaken with greater zeal and constancy than that of bringing the 
  nations of the earth to the truth and principles of Christianity? To-day, as 
  ever, by Our authority, the heralds of the Gospel constantly cross the seas to 
  reach the farthest corners of the earth; and We pray to God daily that in His 
  goodness He may deign to increase the number of His ministers who are really 
  worthy of this apostolate, and who are ready to sacrifice their convenience, 
  their health, and their very life, if need be, in order to extend the 
  frontiers of the kingdom of Christ. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Thou, above all, O Saviour and Father of mankind, Christ 
  Jesus, hasten and do not delay to bring about what Thou didst once promise to 
  do—that when lifted up from the earth Thou wouldst draw all things to Thyself. 
  Come, then, at last, and manifest Thyself to the immense multitude of souls 
  who have not felt, as yet, the ineffable blessings which Thou hast earned for 
  men with Thy blood; rouse those who are sitting in darkness and in the shadow 
  of death, that, enlightened by the rays of Thy wisdom and virtue, in Thee and 
  by Thee &quot;they may be made perfect in one.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we consider the mystery of this unity We see before Us all 
  the countries which have long since passed, by the mercy of God, from timeworn 
  error to the wisdom of the Gospel. Nor could We, indeed, recall anything more 
  pleasing or better calculated to extol the work of divine Providence than the 
  memory of the days of yore, when the faith that had come down from heaven was 
  looked upon as the common inheritance of one and all; when civilized nations, 
  separated by distance, character and habits, in spite of frequent 
  disagreements and warfare on other points, were united by Christian faith in 
  all that concerned religion. The recollection of that time causes Us to regret 
  all the more deeply that as the ages rolled by the waves of suspicion and 
  hatred arose, and great and flourishing nations were dragged away, in an evil 
  hour, from the bosom of the Roman Church. In spite of that, however, We trust 
  in the mercy of God's almighty power, in Him who alone can fix the hour of His 
  benefits and who has power to incline man's will as He pleases; and We turn to 
  those same nations, exhorting and beseeching them with fatherly love to put an 
  end to their dissentions and return again to unity. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, then, We cast an affectionate look upon the 
  East, from whence in the beginning came forth the salvation of the world. Yes, 
  and the yearning desire of Our heart bids us conceive and hope that the day is 
  not far distant when the Eastern Churches, so illustrious in their ancient 
  faith and glorious past, will return to the fold they have abandoned. We hope 
  it all the more, that the distance separating them from Us is not so great: 
  nay, with some few exception, we agree so entirely on other heads that, in 
  defence of the Catholic faith, we often have recourse to reasons and testimony 
  borrowed from the teaching, the rites, and customs of the East. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The principle subject of contention is the primacy of the 
  Roman Pontiff. But let them look back to the early years of their existence, 
  let them consider the sentiments entertained by their forefathers, and examine 
  what the oldest traditions testify, and it will, indeed, become evident to 
  them that Christ's divine utterance, <i>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I 
  will build My Church,</i> has undoubtedly been realized in the Roman Pontiffs. 
  Many of these latter in the first ages of the Church were chosen from the 
  East, and foremost among them Anacletus, Evaristus, Anicetus, Eleutherius, 
  Zosimus, and Agatho; and of these a great number, after governing the Church 
  in wisdom and sanctity, consecrated their ministry with the shedding of their 
  blood. The time, the reasons, the promoters of the unfortunate division, are 
  well known. Before the day when man separated what God had joined together, 
  the name of the Apostolic See was held in reverence by all the nations of the 
  Christian world: and the East, like the West, agreed without hesitation in its 
  obedience to the Pontiff of Rome, as the legitimate successor of St. Peter, 
  and, therefore, the Vicar of Christ here on earth. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And accordingly, if we refer to the beginning of the 
  dissension, we shall see that Photius himself was careful to send his 
  advocates to Rome on the matters that concerned him; and Pope Nicholas I. sent 
  his legates to Constantinople from the Eternal City, without the slightest 
  opposition, &quot;in order to examine the case of Ignatius the Patriarch with all 
  diligence, and to bring back to the Apostolic See a full and accurate report&quot;; 
  so that the history of the whole negotiation is a manifest confirmation of the 
  primacy of the Roman See with which the distention then began. Finally, in two 
  great Councils, the second of Lyons and that of Florence, Latins and Greeks, 
  as is notorious, easily agreed, and all unanimously proclaimed as dogma the 
  supreme power of the Roman Pontiffs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have recalled these things intentionally, for they 
  constitute an invitation to peace and reconciliation; and with all the more 
  reason that in Our own days it would seem as if there were a more conciliatory 
  spirit towards Catholics on the part of the Eastern Churches, and even some 
  degree of kindly feeling. To mention an instance, those sentiments were lately 
  made manifest when some of Our faithful traveled to the East on a holy 
  enterprise, and received so many proofs of courtesy and good-will. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, <i>Our mouth is open to you,</i> to you all of 
  Greek or other Oriental rites who are separated from the Catholic Church. We 
  earnestly desire that each and every one of you should meditate upon the 
  words, so full of gravity and love, addressed by Bessarion to your 
  forefathers: &quot;What answer shall we give to God when He comes to ask why we 
  have separated from our brethren: to Him who, to unite us and bring us into 
  one fold, came down from heaven, was incarnate, and was crucified? What will 
  our defence be in the eyes of posterity? Oh, my Venerable Fathers, we must not 
  suffer this to be, we must not entertain this thought, we must not thus so ill 
  provide for ourselves and for our brethren.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weigh carefully in your minds and before God the nature of 
  Our request. It is not for any human motive, but impelled by divine charity 
  and a desire for the salvation of all, that We advise the reconciliation and 
  union with the Church of Rome; and We mean a perfect and complete union, such 
  as could not subsist in any way if nothing else was brought about but a 
  certain kind of agreement in the tenets of belief and an intercourse of 
  fraternal love. The true union between Christians is that which Jesus Christ, 
  the Author of the Church, instituted and desired, and which consists in a 
  unity of faith and a unity of government. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor is there any reason for you to fear on that account that 
  We or any of Our successors will ever diminish your rights, the privileges of 
  your patriarchs, or the established ritual of any one of your churches. It has 
  been and always will be the intent and tradition of the Apostolic See, to make 
  a large allowance, in all that is right and good, for the primitive traditions 
  and special customs of every nation. On the contrary, if you re-establish 
  union with Us, you will see how, by God's bounty, the glory and dignity of 
  your churches will be remarkably increased. May God, then, in His goodness, 
  hear the prayer that you yourselves address to Him: &quot;Make the schisms of the 
  churches cease,&quot; and &quot;Assemble those who are dispersed, bring back those who 
  err, and unite them to Thy Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.&quot; May you thus 
  return to that one holy Faith which has been handed down both to Us and to you 
  from time immemorial; which your forefathers preserved untainted, and which 
  was enhanced by the rival splendor of the virtues, the great genius, and the 
  sublime learning of St. Athanasius and St. Basil, St. Gregory of Nazianzum and 
  St. John Chrysostom, the two saints who bore the name of Cyril, and so many 
  other great men whose glory belongs as a common inheritance to the East and to 
  the West. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffer that We should address you more particularly, nations 
  of the Slavonic race, you whose glorious name and deeds are attested by many 
  an ancient record. You know full well how much the Slavs are indebted to the 
  merits of St. Cyril and St. Methodius, to whose memory We Ourselves have 
  rendered due honor only a few years ago. Their virtues and their labors were 
  to great numbers of your race the source of civilization and salvation. And 
  hence the admirable interchange, which existed for so long between the 
  Slavonic nations and the Pontiffs of Rome, of favors on the one side and of 
  filial devotion on the other. If in unhappy time many of your forefathers were 
  separated from the Faith of Rome, consider now what priceless benefits a 
  return of unity would bring to you. The Church may give you manifold aids to 
  salvation, prosperity, and grandeur. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With no less affection do We now look upon the nations who, 
  at a more recent date, were separated from the Roman Church by an 
  extraordinary revolution of things and circumstances. Let them forget the 
  various events of times gone by, let them raise their thoughts far above all 
  that is human, and seeking only truth and salvation, reflect within their 
  hearts upon the Church as it was constituted by Christ. If they will but 
  compare that Church with their own communions, and consider what the actual 
  state of religion is in these, they will easily acknowledge that, forgetful of 
  their early history, they have drifted away, on many and important points, 
  into the novelty of various errors; nor will they deny that of what may be 
  called the patrimony of truth, which the authors of those innovations carried 
  away with them in their desertion, there now scarcely remains to them any 
  article of belief that is really certain and supported by authority. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, more, things have already come to such a pass that many 
  do not even hesitate to root up the very foundation upon which alone rests all 
  religion, and the hope of men, to wit, the divine nature of Jesus Christ, our 
  Saviour. And again, whereas formerly they used to assert that the books of the 
  Old and the New Testament were written under the inspiration of God, they now 
  deny them that authority: this, indeed, was an inevitable consequence when 
  they granted to all the right of private interpretation. Hence, too, the 
  acceptance of individual conscience as the sole guide and rule of conduct to 
  the exclusion of any other: hence those conflicting opinions and numerous 
  sects that fall away so often into the doctrines of Naturalism and 
  Rationalism. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore it is, that having lost all hope of an agreement in 
  their persuasions, they now proclaim and recommend a union of brotherly love. 
  And rightly, too, no doubt, for we should all be united by the bond of mutual 
  charity. Our Lord Jesus Christ enjoined it most emphatically, and wished that 
  this love of one another should be the mark of His disciples. But how can 
  hearts be united in perfect charity where minds do not agree in faith? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is on this account that many of those We allude to men of 
  sound judgment and seeking after truth, have looked to the Catholic Church for 
  the sure way of salvation; for they clearly understand that they could never 
  be united to Jesus Christ as their head if they were not members of His body, 
  which is the Church; nor really acquire the true Christian faith if they 
  rejected the legitimate teaching confided to Peter and his successors. Such 
  men as these have recognized in the Church of Rome the form and image of the 
  true Church, which is clearly made manifest by the marks of God, her Author, 
  placed upon her: and not a few who were possessed with penetrating judgment 
  and a special talent for historical research, have shown forth in their 
  remarkable writings the uninterrupted succession of the Church of Rome from 
  the apostles, the integrity of her doctrine, and the consistency of her rule 
  and discipline. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the example of such men before you, Our heart appeals to 
  you even more than Our words: to you, Our Brethren, who for three centuries 
  and more differ from Us on Christian faith; and to you all likewise, who in 
  later times, for any reason whatsoever, have turned away from Us: <i>Let us 
  all meet in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</i> 
  Suffer that We should invite you to the unity which has ever existed in the 
  Catholic Church and can never fail; suffer that We should lovingly hold out 
  Our hand to you. The Church, as the common mother of all, has long been 
  calling you back to her; the Catholics of the world await you with brotherly 
  love, that you may render holy worship to God together with us, united in 
  perfect charity by the profession of one Gospel, one faith, and one hope. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To complete the harmony of this most desired unity, it 
  remains for Us to address all those throughout the world whose salvation has 
  long been the object of Our thoughts and watchful cares; We mean Catholics, 
  whom the profession of the Roman faith, while it renders them obedient to the 
  Apostolic See, preserves in union with Jesus Christ. There is no need to 
  exhort them to true and holy unity, since through the divine goodness they 
  already possess it; nevertheless, they must be admonished, lest under pressure 
  of the growing perils on all sides around them, through negligence or 
  indolence they should lose this great blessing of God. For this purpose, let 
  them take this rule of thought and action, as the occasion may require, from 
  those instructions which at other times We have addressed to Catholic peoples, 
  either collectively or individually; and above all, let them lay down for 
  themselves as a supreme law, to yield obedience in all things to the teaching 
  and authority of the Church, in no narrow or mistrustful spirit, but with 
  their whole soul and promptitude of will. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this account let them consider how injurious to Christian 
  unity is that error, which in various forms of opinion has ofttimes obscured, 
  nay, even destroyed the true character and idea of the Church. For by the will 
  and ordinance of God, its Founder, it is a society perfect in its kind, whose 
  office and mission it is to school mankind in the precepts and teachings of 
  the Gospel, and by safeguarding the integrity of moral and the exercise of 
  Christian virtue, to lead men to that happiness which is held out to every one 
  in heaven. And since it is, as we have said, a perfect society, therefore it 
  is endowed with a living power and efficacy which is not derived from any 
  external source, but in virtue of the ordinance of God and its own 
  constitution, inherent in its very nature; for the same reason it has an 
  inborn power of making laws, and justice requires that it its exercise it 
  should be dependent on no one; it must likewise have freedom in other matters 
  appertaining to its rights. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this freedom is not of a kind to occasion rivalry or 
  envy, for the Church does not covet power, nor is she urged on by any selfish 
  desire; but this one thing she does wish, this only does she seek, to preserve 
  amongst men the duties which virtue imposes, and by this means and in this way 
  to provide for their everlasting welfare. Therefore is she wont to be yielding 
  and indulgent as a mother; yea, it not unfrequently happens that in making 
  large concessions to the exigencies of States, she refrains from the exercise 
  of her own rights, as the compacts often concluded with civil governments 
  abundantly testify. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing is more foreign to her disposition than to encroach 
  on the rights of civil power; but the civil power in its turn must respect the 
  rights of the Church and beware of arrogating them in any degree to itself. 
  Now, what is the ruling spirit of the times when actual events and 
  circumstances are taken into account? No other than this: it has been the 
  fashion to regard the Church with suspicion, to despise and hate and 
  spitefully calumniate her; and, more tolerable still, men strive with might 
  and main to bring her under the sway of civil governments. Hence it is that 
  her property has been plundered and her liberty curtailed: hence again, that 
  the training of her priesthood has been beset with difficulties; that laws of 
  exceptional rigor have been passed against her clergy; that religious orders, 
  those excellent safeguards of Christianity, have been suppressed and placed 
  under a ban; in a word, the principles and practice of the regalists have been 
  renewed with increased virulence. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a policy is a violation of the most sacred rights of the 
  Church, and it breeds enormous evils to States, for the very reason that it is 
  open conflict with the purposes of God. When God, in His most wise providence, 
  placed over human society both temporal and spiritual authority, He intended 
  them to remain distinct indeed, but by no means disconnected and at war with 
  each other. On the contrary, both the will of God and the common weal of human 
  society imperatively require that the civil power should be in accord with the 
  ecclesiastical in its rule and administration. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the State has its own peculiar rights and duties, the 
  Church likewise has hers; but it is necessary that each should be united with 
  the other in the bonds of Concord. Thus will it come about that the close of 
  mutual relations of Church and State will be freed from the present turmoil, 
  which for manifold reasons is ill-advised and most distressing to all 
  well-disposed persons; furthermore, it will be brought to pass that, without 
  confusion or separation of the peculiar interests of each, the people will <i>
  render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are 
  God's.</i> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is likewise a great danger threatening unity on the 
  part of that association which goes by the name of the society of Freemasons, 
  whose fatal influence for a long time past oppresses Catholic nations in 
  particular. Favored by the agitations of the times, and waxing insolent in its 
  power and resources and success, it strains every nerve to consolidate its 
  sway and enlarge it sphere. It has already sallied forth from its 
  hiding-places, where it hatched its plots, into the throng of cities, and as 
  if to defy the Almighty, has set up its throne in this very city of Rome, the 
  capitol of the Catholic world. But what is most disastrous is, that wherever 
  it has set its foot it penetrates into all ranks and departments of the 
  commonwealth, in the hope of obtaining at last supreme control. This is, 
  indeed, a great calamity: for its depraved principles and iniquitous designs 
  are well known. Under the pretence of vindicating the rights of man and of 
  reconstituting society, it attacks Christianity; it rejects revealed doctrine, 
  denounces practices of piety, the divine sacraments, and every sacred thing as 
  superstition; it strives to eliminate the Christian character from marriage 
  and the family and the education of youth, and from every form of instruction, 
  whether public or private, and to root out from the minds of men all respect 
  for authority, whether human or divine. On its own part, it preaches the 
  worship of nature, and maintains that the principles of nature are truth and 
  probity and justice to be measured and regulated. In this way, as is quite 
  evident, man is being driven to adopt customs and habits of like akin to those 
  of the heathen, only more corrupt in proportion as the incentives to sin are 
  more numerous. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although We have spoken on this subject in the strongest 
  terms before, yet We are led by our Apostolic watchfulness to urge it once 
  more, and we repeat Our warning again and again, that in face of such an 
  eminent peril, no precaution, howsoever great, can be looked upon as 
  sufficient. May God in His mercy bring to naught their impious designs; 
  nevertheless, let all Christians know and understand that the shameful yoke of 
  Freemasonry must be shaken off once and for all; and let them be the first to 
  shake it off who are most galled by its oppression—the men of Italy and 
  France. With what weapons and by what means this may best be done We Ourselves 
  have already pointed out: the victory cannot be doubtful to those who trust in 
  that leader whose divine words still remain in all their force: <i>I have 
  overcome the world.</i> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were this twofold danger averted, and government and States 
  restored to the unity of faith, it is wonderful what efficacious remedies for 
  evils and abundant store of benefits would ensue. We will touch upon the 
  principle ones. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first regards the dignity and office of the Church. She 
  would receive that honor which is her due and she would go on her way, free 
  from envy and strong in her liberty, as the minister of Gospel truth and grace 
  to the notable welfare of States. For as she has been given by God as a 
  teacher and guide to the human race, she can contribute assistance which is 
  peculiarly adapted to direct even the most radical transformations of time to 
  the common good, to solve the most complicated questions, and to promote 
  uprightness and justice, which are the most solid foundations of the 
  commonwealth. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover there would be a marked increase of union among the 
  nations, a thing most desirable to ward off the horrors of war. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We behold the condition of Europe. For many years past peace 
  has been rather an appearance than a reality. Possessed with the mutual 
  suspicions, almost all the nations are vying with one another in equipping 
  themselves with military armaments. Inexperienced youths are removed from 
  parental direction and control, to be thrown amid the dangers of the soldier's 
  life; robust young men are taken from agriculture or ennobling studies or 
  trade or the arts to be put under arms. Hence the treasures of States are 
  exhausted by the enormous expenditure, the national resources are frittered 
  away, and private fortunes are impaired; and this, as it were, armed peace, 
  which now prevails, cannot last much longer. Can this be the normal condition 
  of human society? Yet we cannot escape from this situation, and obtain true 
  peace, except by the aid of Jesus Christ. For to repress ambition and 
  covetousness and envy—the chief instigators of war—nothing is more fitted than 
  the Christian virtues and, in particular, the virtue of justice; for, by its 
  exercise, both the law of nations and the faith of treaties may be maintained 
  inviolate, and the bonds of brotherhood continue unbroken, if men are but 
  convinced that <i>justice exalteth a nation.</i> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As in its external relations, so in the internal life of the 
  State itself, the Christian virtues will provide a guarantee of the commonweal 
  much more sure and stronger far than any which laws or armies can afford. For 
  there is no one who does not see that the dangers to public security and order 
  are daily on the increase, since seditious societies continue to conspire for 
  the overthrow and ruin of States, as the frequency of their atrocious outrages 
  testifies. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two questions, forsooth—the one called the <i>
  social,</i> and the other the <i>political</i> question—which are discussed 
  with the greatest vehemence. Both of them, without doubt, are of the last 
  importance, and, though praiseworthy efforts have been put forth, in studies 
  and measures and experiments for their wise and just solution, yet nothing 
  could contribute more to this purpose than that of the minds of men in general 
  should be imbued with right sentiments of duty from the internal principle of 
  Christian faith. We treated expressly of the social question in this sense a 
  short time ago, from the standpoint of principles drawn from the Gospel and 
  natural reason. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the political question, which aims at reconciling 
  liberty with authority—two things which many confound in theory, and separate 
  too widely in practice—most efficient aid may be derived from the Christian 
  philosophy. For, when this point has been settled and recognized by common 
  agreement, that, whatsoever the form of government, the authority is from God, 
  reason at once perceives that in some there is a legitimate right to command, 
  in others the corresponding duty to obey, and that without prejudice to their 
  dignity, since obedience is rendered to God rather than to man; and God has 
  denounced the most rigorous judgment against those in authority, if they fail 
  to represent Him with uprightness and justice. Then the liberty of the 
  individual can afford ground of suspicion or envy to no one; since, without 
  injury to any, his conduct will be guided by truth and rectitude and whatever 
  is allied to public order. Lastly, if it be considered what influence is 
  possessed by the Church, the mother of and peacemaker between rulers and 
  peoples, whose mission it is to help them both with her authority and counsel, 
  then it will be most manifest how much it concerns the commonweal that all 
  nations should resolve to unite in the same belief and the same profession of 
  the Christian faith. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these thoughts in Our mind and ardent yearnings in Our 
  heart, We see from afar what would be the new order of things that would arise 
  upon the earth, and nothing could be sweeter to Us than the contemplation of 
  the benefits that would flow from it. It can hardly be imagined what immediate 
  and rapid progress would be made all over the earth, in all manner of 
  greatness and prosperity, with the establishment of tranquility and peace, the 
  promotion of studies, the founding and the multiplying on Christian lines 
  according to Our directions, of associations for the cultivators of soil, for 
  workmen and tradesman, through whose agency rapacious usury would be put down, 
  and a large field opened up for useful labors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And these abundant benefits would not be confined within the 
  limits of civilized nations, but, like an overcharged river, would flow far 
  and wide. It must be remembered, as we observed at the outset, that an immense 
  number of races have been waiting, all through the long ages, to receive the 
  light of truth and civilization. Most certainly, the counsels of God with 
  regard to the eternal salvation of peoples are far removed above the 
  understanding of man; yet if miserable superstition still prevails in so many 
  parts of the world, the blame must be attributed in no small measure to 
  religious dissentions. For, as far as it given to human reason to judge from 
  the nature of events, this seems without doubt to be the mission assigned by 
  God to Europe, to go on by degrees carrying Christian civilization to every 
  portion of the earth. The beginnings and first growth of this great work, 
  which sprang from the labors of former centuries, were rapidly receiving large 
  development, when all of a sudden the discord of the sixteenth century broke 
  out. Christendom was torn with quarrels and dissentions, Europe exhausted with 
  contests and wars, and the sacred missions felt the baneful influence of the 
  times. While the causes of distention still remain, what wonder is it that so 
  large a portion of mankind is held enthralled with barbarous customs and 
  insane rites?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us one and all, then, for the sake of the common welfare, 
  labor with equal assiduity to restore the ancient concord. In order to bring 
  about this concord, and spread abroad the benefits of the Christian 
  revelation, the present is the most seasonable time; for never before have the 
  sentiments of human brotherhood penetrated so deeply into the souls of men, 
  and never in any age has man been seen to seek out his fellowmen more eagerly 
  in order to know them better and to help them. Immense tracts of land and sea 
  are traversed with incredible rapidly, and thus extraordinary advantages are 
  afforded not only for commerce and scientific investigations but also for the 
  propagation of the word of God from the rising of the sun to the going down of 
  the same. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are well aware of the long labors involved in the 
  restoration of that order of things which We desire; and it may be that there 
  are those who consider that We are far too sanguine and look for things that 
  are rather too be wished for than expected. But We unhesitatingly place all 
  Our hope and confidence in the Saviour of mankind, Jesus Christ, well 
  remembering what great things have been achieved in times past by the folly of 
  the Cross and its preaching, to the astonishment and confusion of the <i>
  wisdom of the world.</i> We beg of princes and rulers of States, appealing to 
  their statesmanship and earnest solicitude for the people, to weigh Our 
  counsels in the balance of truth and second them with their authority and 
  favor. If only a portion of the looked-for results should come about, it will 
  cause no inconsiderable boon in the general decadence, with the intolerable 
  evils of the present day bring them with dread of further evils in days to 
  come. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last years of the past century left Europe worn out with 
  disasters and panic-stricken with the turmoils of revolution. And why should 
  not our present century, which is now hastening to its close, by a reversion 
  of circumstances bequeath to mankind the pledges of concord, with the 
  prospects of the great benefits which are bound up in the unity of the 
  Christian faith? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May God, who <i>is rich in mercy, and in whose power are the 
  times and moments,</i> grant Our wishes and desires, and in His great 
  goodness, hasten the fulfillment of that divine promise of Jesus Christ: <i>
  There will be one Fold and one Shepherd.</i></font></p>
