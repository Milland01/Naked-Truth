            <blockquote>
              <p align="left">&quot;Clearly there is a need for a liberating process 
              of purification of memory. For the occasions past and present, 
              when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by 
              action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, 
              may the Lord grant us the forgiveness we beg of Him.&quot;</p>
              <p align="left">&quot;Some memories are especially painful, and some 
              events of the distant past have left deep wounds in the minds and 
              hearts of people to this day. I am thinking of the disastrous sack 
              of the imperial city of Constantinople, which was for so long the 
              bastion of Christianity in the East. It is tragic that the 
              assailants, who had set out to secure free access for Christians 
              to the Holy Land, turned against their own brothers in the faith. 
              The fact that they were Latin Christians [Roman Catholics] fills 
              Catholics with deep regret. <b>How can we fail to see here the '<font 
              color="#FF0000">mysterium iniquitatis</font>' at work</b> [2 Thess. 
              2:7] in the human heart? To God alone belongs judgment and, 
              therefore, we entrust the heavy burden of the past to his endless 
              mercy, imploring him to heal the wounds that still cause suffering 
              to the spirit of the Greek people.&quot;</p>

  <p align="left"><font size="3">On March 12th, 2000, at the Vatican in Rome, 
  Pope John Paul II formally asked forgiveness for the various persecution sins 
  committed by the Catholic Church over the last two millennium. In his &quot;Day of 
  Pardon&quot; homily, the pope confessed:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;... we cannot fail to recognize the infidelities to the 
    Gospel committed by some of our brethren, especially during the second 
    millennium. Let us ask pardon for the divisions which have occurred among 
    Christians, for the violence some have used in the service of the truth and 
    for the distrustful and hostile attitudes sometimes taken towards the 
    followers of other religions.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">The Pope had previously a</font>dmitted that 
  Catholic:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&quot;... acquiescence given to intolerance and even the use of 
    violence in the service of truth (cf. <font size="2"><img src="star.gif" 
    alt="star.gif (4793 bytes)" width="16" height="12"></font>
    <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_10111994_tertio-millennio-adveniente_en.html">
    <b>Tertio Millennio Adveniente</b></a>, n. 35). Although many acted here in 
    good faith, it was certainly not evangelical to think that the truth should 
    be imposed by force. Then there is the lack of discernment by many 
    Christians in situations where basic human rights were violated.&quot;<br>

  <p align="left">These assert that Catholics erred only in their zealousness to 
  forcefully impose <em>the truth</em> on heretics. It seems the Pope overlooks 
  the fact that Protestants broke away from Catholicism after concluding that it 
  had <em>fallen away from the truth</em>. Access to vernacular Bibles coming 
  from Protestant printing presses exposed the blatant apostasy of the Roman 
  Catholic Church to the Protestant reformers, and they all came to the 
  conclusion that Rome was Mystery Babylon, the apostate church, which scripture 
  also plainly identifies as a bloody persecutor, dressed in purple and scarlet.</p>

  <p align="left">The apostate woman (church) of Revelation 17, who wears purple 
  and scarlet, is clearly located geographically in scripture:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven 
    heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:15 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, 
    where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and 
    tongues.</p>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:18 And the woman which thou sawest is that great 
    city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The apostate persecuting church, the mother of harlots, &quot;sits&quot; 
  or rules from the seven-hilled city of Rome, and claims to rule &quot;universally&quot; 
  (Catholic) over all the kings and people of the world. That Pope John Paul II 
  now acknowledges Catholic guilt, and wants to ask forgiveness for all the 
  blood the Catholic Church has shed, only serves to further confirm her 
  identity as Mystery Babylon, and scripture says the following regarding her:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, 
    Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of 
    devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and 
    hateful bird.<br>
    Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
    fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, 
    and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
    delicacies.<br>
    Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my 
    people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her 
    plagues.<br>
    Rev 18:5 For <b>her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered 
    her iniquities.</b><br>
    Rev 18:6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double 
    according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The truth is that Pope John Paul II is not responsible for the 
  blood shed by Catholics of the past, and he cannot be granted forgiveness for 
  the sins committed by his church. Those who committed the acts of persecution 
  and oppression will be responsible for them, and if <em>they</em> did not seek 
  forgiveness and repent of their sins, then they will suffer for them in the 
  judgment. As Revelation 18 makes clear, God's people are asked to come out of 
  the apostasy of Catholicism, and embrace the biblical truths of scripture 
  before she is judged for her apostasy and iniquities. The Pope, by seeking 
  forgiveness for past Catholic atrocities, is merely admitting that the blood 
  of thousands of uncounted innocents is indeed on her hands, just as scripture 
  charges.</p>

        Rome's Apologies Predicted 116 Years Ago!</font></u></b></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Romish Church now presents a 
          fair front to the world, covering with apologies her record of 
          horrible cruelties. She has clothed herself in Christ like garments; 
          but she is unchanged. Every principle of popery that existed in ages 
          past exists to-day. The doctrines devised in the darkest ages are 
          still held. Let none deceive themselves. The popery that Protestants 
          are now so ready to embrace and honor is the same that ruled the world 
          in the days of the Reformation, when men of God stood up at the peril 
          of their lives to expose her iniquity. She possesses the same pride 
          and arrogant assumption [pg. 388] that lorded it over kings and 
          princes, and claimed the prerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less 
          cruel and despotic now than when she crushed out human liberty, and 
          slew the saints of the Most High.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Popery is just what prophecy declared that she would be,--the 
          apostasy of the latter times. It is a part of her policy to assume the 
          character which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the 
          variable appearance of the chameleon, she conceals the invariable 
          venom of the serpent. &quot;We are not bound to keep faith and promises to 
          heretics,&quot; she declares. Shall this power, whose record for a thousand 
          years is written in the blood of the saints, be now acknowledged as a 
          part of the church of Christ?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not without reason that the claim has been put forth 
          that Catholicism is now almost like Protestantism. There has been a 
          change; but the change is in Protestants, not in Romanists. 
          Catholicism indeed resembles the Protestantism that now exists; but it 
          is far removed from Protestantism as it was in the days of Cranmer, 
          Ridley, Knox, and other reformers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Protestant churches have been seeking the favor of the 
          world, false charity has blinded their eyes. They do not see but that 
          it is right to believe good of all evil; and as the inevitable result, 
          they will finally believe evil of all good. Instead of standing in 
          defense of the faith once delivered to the saints, they are now, as it 
          were, apologizing to Rome for their uncharitable opinion of her, 
          begging pardon for their bigotry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A large class, even of those who look upon Romanism with no 
          favor, apprehend little danger from her [pg. 389] power and influence. 
          Many urge that the intellectual and moral darkness prevailing during 
          the Middle Ages favored the spread of her dogmas, superstitions, and 
          oppression, and that the greater intelligence of modern times, the 
          general diffusion of knowledge, and the increasing liberality in 
          matters of religion, forbid a revival of intolerance and tyranny. The 
          very thought that such a state of things will exist in this 
          enlightened age is ridiculed. It is true that great light, 
          intellectual, moral, and religious, is shining upon this generation. 
          In the open pages of God's holy word, light from Heaven has been shed 
          upon the world. But it should be remembered that the greater the light 
          bestowed, the greater the darkness of those who pervert or reject it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A prayerful study of the Bible would show Protestants the 
          real character of the papacy, and would cause them to abhor and to 
          shun it; but men are so wise in their own conceit that they feel no 
          need of humbly seeking God that they may be led into the truth. 
          Although priding themselves on their enlightenment, they are ignorant 
          both of the Scriptures and of the power of God. They must have some 
          means of quieting their consciences; and they seek that which is least 
          spiritual and humiliating. What they desire is a method of forgetting 
          God which shall pass as a method of remembering him. The papacy is 
          well adapted to meet the wants of all these. It is prepared for two 
          classes of mankind, embracing nearly the whole world,--those who would 
          be saved by their merits, and those who would be saved in their sins. 
          Here is the secret of its power. [pg. 390]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day of great intellectual darkness has been shown to be 
          favorable to the success of popery. It will yet be demonstrated that a 
          day of great intellectual light is equally favorable for its success. 
          In past ages, when men were without God's word, and without the 
          knowledge of the truth, their eyes were blindfolded, and thousands 
          were ensnared, not seeing the net spread for their feet. In this 
          generation there are many whose eyes become dazzled by the glare of 
          human speculations, &quot;science falsely so called;&quot; they discern not the 
          net, and walk into it as readily as if blindfolded. God designed that 
          man's intellectual powers should be held as a gift from his Maker, and 
          employed in the service of truth and righteousness; but when they are 
          idolized, and laid upon the shrine of Satan to be employed in the 
          service of a false religion, then intelligence can accomplish greater 
          harm than ignorance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the movements now in progress in this country to secure 
          for the institutions and usages of the church the support of the 
          State, Protestants are following in the steps of papists. Nay, more, 
          they are opening the door for popery to regain in Protestant America 
          the supremacy which she has lost in the Old World. And that which 
          gives greater significance to this movement is the fact that the 
          principal object contemplated is the enforcement of Sunday observance, 
          --a custom which originated with Rome, and which she claims as the 
          sign of her authority.</p>
