  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A short time ago this
    staid city of London experienced a tempest in a teapot over Sabbath
    observance. It was proposed to allow the children to use the municipal
    swimming pool during the sweltering weather we were then having. Immediately
    there was a ministerial chorus of protest. One reverend Boanerges valiantly
    declared that they would not rest until they had routed &quot;the hosts of
    hell.&quot; Presumably he saw in apocalyptic vision the infernal armies
    lined up behind His Worship the Mayor and others in their impious assault on
    the sanctity of &quot;the Sabbath.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine the consternation in the ministerial association
    and the jubilation amongst the hosts of hell when they read in the London
    Free Press of this dastardly flank attack on their citadel of sabbatarianism:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That Sabbath observance in the strict sense of the
    law of Israel, whether on the traditional or any seventh day, is no concern
    of the Christian, was the assertion of Rev. J. Marion Smith, of Emmanuel
    Baptist Church, Toronto, in his evening sermon yesterday at the Talbot
    Street Baptist Church.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this under a two-column heading: &quot;Sabbath
    Observance Not Any Part of Man's Duty as a Christian!&quot; True, Mr. Smith
    was speaking to the &quot;interogative subject,&quot; &quot;Can a Saved Man
    Be Lost?&quot; That is quite a big subject in itself; but we shall take
    first his pronouncement on the Sabbath, which evidently struck the reporter
    and the city editor as the more sensational if not the more important part
    of the sermon. The report of the Free Press Continues:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Quoting St. Paul, he declares that making any point
    of the old Mosaic law a test of righteousness is to accept the full burden
    of the rules, rituals and customs enjoined by Moses.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; 'In Toronto, for instance', he said, 'there are
    many who make a great point of Sabbath observance. I do not consider it any
    part of my duty as a Christian to observe the Sabbath. When Christ came the
    old law was fulfilled and done away with. Christ was the only being, as a
    human, who could and did observe the whole law. Of course, as a Christian I
    observe certain rules of conduct and habit. But that is the matter of
    personal purity.' &quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be noted that the last paragraph purports to
    quote the very words of the preacher.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Toronto Star the Rev. Mr. Smith gave an
    explanatory interview which, though it may tend to allay Sabbatarian
    indignation, does not claim that he was misreported; indeed he further
    emphasizes the fact that the Jewish Sabbath and Christian Sunday are quite
    distinct and separate institutions.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote from The Star:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Jewish Sabbath is not Sunday, the Lord's Day.
    Christians are all wrong in speaking of the Sabbath as Sunday.&quot; said
    Mr. Smith. &quot;The Sabbath is not binding upon a Christian as a means of
    justification from sin,&quot; he went on. &quot;The keeping of Sunday, the
    Lord's day, is quite a different matter, and springs not from any obligation
    to the Jewish Law, but is the ready response from the heart of the Christian
    who observes Sunday as a day set aside for worship and rest. This observance
    is one of the highest privileges of mankind, and it is only reasonable that
    one-seventh of a man's time should be devoted to special worship and
    spiritual refreshment.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And further to mollify the critics he added in
    conclusion:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One of the greatest blessings of Canada had been
    due to the strict observance of the Lord's Day. To throw Sunday wide open
    would be to paralyze much good that is now accomplished and to throw
    unlimited temptation before the young life of our boys and girls.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ministers of London who criticize Mr. Smith's sermon
    left the real crux of the question untouched. And that is not surprising,
    for on Protestant principles there is no possible explanation of the
    substitution of the Christian Sunday for the Jewish Sabbath; for this plain
    abrogation of the express commandment of God as recorded in the Bible.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protestants reject Divine Tradition, the Unwritten Word,
    which Catholics accept as of equal authority with the Written Word, the
    Bible. The Divine authority given by Christ to the Church to teach in His
    name, to bind and loose, Protestants deny. For them - and it is their boast
    - the Bible and the Bible alone has Divine authority.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in the matter of Sabbath observance the Protestant
    rule of Faith is utterly unable to explain the substitution of the Christian
    Sunday for the Jewish Saturday. It has been changed. The Bible still teaches
    that the Sabbath or Saturday should be kept holy. There is no authority in
    the New Testament for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday. Surely it is
    an important matter. It stands there in the Bible as one of the Ten
    Commandments of God. There is no authority in the Bible for abrogating this
    Commandment, or for transferring its observance to another day of the week.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Catholics it is not the slightest difficulty.
    &quot;All power is given Me in heaven and on earth; as the Father sent Me so
    I also send you,&quot; said our Divine Lord in giving His tremendous
    commission to His Apostles. &quot;He that heareth you heareth Me.&quot; We
    have in the authoritative voice of the Church the voice of Christ Himself. <strong>The
    Church is above the Bible; and this transference of Sabbath observance from
    Saturday to Sunday is proof positive of that fact.</strong> Deny the
    authority of the Church and you have no adequate or reasonable explanation
    or justification for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday in the Third -
    Protestant Fourth - Commandment of God. As the Rev. Mr. Smith rightly points
    out: &quot;The Jewish Sabbath is not Sunday, the Lord's Day. Christians are
    all wrong in speaking of the Sabbath as Sunday.&quot; The Christians who so
    speak are &quot;Bible Christians,&quot; those who make the Bible the sole
    rule of Faith; and the Bible is silent on Sunday observance, it speaks only
    of Sabbath observance. The Lord's Day - Dies Dominica - is the term used
    always in the Missal and the Breviary. It occurs in the Bible once (Apoc.
    1.10;) in Acts xx. 7 and 1 Cor. xvi., 2 there is a reference to &quot;the
    first day of the week;&quot; but in none of these is there the remotest
    intimation that henceforth the first day is to take the place of the
    seventh. That is the crux of the whole question, what authority does the
    Bible give for the change? And that difficulty Mr. Smith and his critics,
    though pious and effusive and vaguely eloquent about many things, have each
    and all sedulously evaded.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If affects very materially and very intimately the
    question of the proper observance of the Lord's Day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first centuries the obligation of rest from work
    remained somewhat indefinite. The Council of Laodicea, held at the end of
    the fourth century, was content to prescribe that on the Lord's Day the
    faithful were to abstain from work as far as possible. At the beginning of
    the sixth century St. Cesarius and others showed an inclination - very
    familiar to us - to apply the law of the Jewish Sabbath to the Christian
    Sunday. But the Council of Orleans in 538 reprobated this tendency as Jewish
    and non-Christian.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus by the same Divine authority, in virtue of which she
    did away with the Jewish Sabbath and substituted therefor the Christian
    Sunday, the Catholic Church legislated as to how the Lord's Day should be
    observed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the exaggerated importance given the Bible after
    the Reformation and to the influence of Puritanism, the Lord's Day in
    England and still more in Scotland began to take on all the rigorism of the
    Jewish Sabbath. That heritage, though somewhat softened, we still have with
    us. A game of ball where participants and spectators enjoy health-giving
    rest and recreation in the open air is &quot;desecration of the
    Sabbath.&quot; The swimming pool controversy is another good example.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would not be misunderstood. With much of the activity
    of the Sabbatarians we are in sympathy. Their insistence on a day of rest
    being given all workers is admirable. But their muddle-headed confusion of
    the Lord's Day with the Jewish Sabbath - against which the Rev. Mr. Smith so
    vigorously protests - finds no sympathy amongst the Catholics who receive
    the Lord's Day itself as well as its mode of observance from the Church and
    not from the Bible.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It might serve a good purpose if the Sabbatarians would
    meditate on Mark ii, 23-28.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And it came to pass again, as the Lord walked
    through the cornfields on the sabbath, that his disciples began to go
    forward and pluck the ears of corn. And the Pharisees said to Him: Behold
    why do they on the sabbath-day that which is not lawful?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And He said to them: Have you never read what David
    did, when he had need, and was hungry himself and they that were with them?
    How he went into the house of God under Abiathar the high-priest and did eat
    the loaves of proposition which was not lawful to eat but for the priests,
    and gave to them who were with him?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And He said unto them: The sabbath was made for
    man, not man for the sabbath.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the great principle that is forgotten under the
    damnosa hereditas of Puritanical sabbatarianism.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Divine Lord observed the Sabbath; but by word and
    deed he set Himself against the absurd rigorism that made man the slave of
    the day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The train of thought and discussion set in motion by the
    Rev. Mr. Smith if followed up to its logical conclusion should serve a very
    good and very practical purpose.</font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>14. ... Catholic doctrine, as authoritatively proposed by the Church, 
    should be held as the supreme law; for, seeing that the same God is the 
    author both of the Sacred Books and of the doctrine committed to the Church, 
    it is clearly impossible that any teaching can by legitimate means be 
    extracted from the former, which shall in any respect be at variance with 
    the latter. <font size="3">Hence it follows that all interpretation is 
    foolish and false which either makes the sacred writers disagree one with 
    another, or is opposed to the doctrine of the Church.</font></p>

    Scripture), Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII dated November 18th, 1893.</p>
	  <hr>
	  <p style="margin-left:">As we know, the Sacred Scriptures are the written 
	testimony of the divine word, the canonical memorial that testifies to the 
	event of Revelation. <strong>The Word of God therefore precedes and exceeds 
	the Bible.</strong> This is why <strong>our faith is not only centred on a 
	book</strong> but on a history of salvation and above all on a Person, Jesus 
	Christ, the Word of God made flesh. Precisely because the horizon of the 
	divine word embraces and extends beyond Scripture, to understand it 
	adequately the constant presence of the Holy Spirit is necessary, who “will 
	guide you into all the truth” (Jn 16:13). <strong>We must put ourselves in 
	line with the great Tradition</strong> which, under the guidance of the Holy 
	Spirit and of the Magisterium, recognized the canonical writings as a word 
	which God addressed to his People and never ceased to meditate on them and 
	to discover their inexhaustible riches. </p>
	  <p style="margin-left:">It follows that the exegete must be attentive to 
	  perceiving the word of God present in the biblical texts, fitting them 
	  into the Church's faith itself. <strong>The interpretation of the Sacred 
	Scriptures cannot only be an individual scientific effort. Rather, it must 
	always be confronted, inserted and authenticated by the living Tradition of 
	the Church.</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;
