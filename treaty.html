  <p><font size="3">The Lateran Pacts of 1929 contained three sections—the 
  Treaty of Conciliation (27 articles) which established Vatican City as an 
  independent state, restoring the civil sovereignty of the Pope as a monarch, 
  the <a href="#2.">Financial Convention</a> annexed to the treaty (3 articles) 
  which compensated the Holy See for loss of the papal states, and the
  <a href="#3.">Concordat</a> (45 articles), which dealt with the Roman Catholic 
  Church's ecclesiastical relations with the Italian State.</font></p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I<font size="2">N</font> the name of the 
  Most Holy Trinity.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas the Holy See and Italy have 
  recognized the desirability of eliminating every reason for dissension 
  existing between them and arriving at a final settlement of their reciprocal 
  relations which shall be consistent with justice and with the dignity of both 
  High Contracting Parties, and which by permanently assuring to the Holy See a 
  position <em>de facto</em> and <em>de jure</em> which shall guarantee absolute 
  independence for the fulfillment of its exalted mission in the world, permits 
  the Holy See to consider as finally and irrevocably settled the Roman Question 
  which arose in 1870 by the annexation of Rome to the Kingdom of Italy, under 
  the Dynasty of the House of Savoy;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whereas it was obligatory, for the 
  purpose of assuring the absolute and visible independence of the Holy See, 
  likewise to guarantee its indisputable sovereignty in international matters, 
  it has been found necessary to create under special conditions the Vatican 
  City, recognizing the full ownership, exclusive and absolute dominion and 
  sovereign jurisdiction of the Holy See over that City;</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Holiness the Supreme Pontiff Pius XI 
  and His Majesty Victor Emanuel III, King of Italy, have agreed to conclude a 
  Treaty, appointing for that purpose two Plenipotentiaries, being on behalf of 
  His Holiness, His Secretary of State, viz. His Most Reverend Eminence the Lord 
  Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, and on behalf of his Majesty, His Excellency the Cav. 
  Benito Mussolini, Prime Minister and Head of the Government; who, having 
  exchanged their respective full powers, which were found to be in due and 
  proper form, have hereby agreed to the following articles:</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 1</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy recognizes and reaffirms the 
  principle established in the first Article of the Italian Constitution dated 
  March 4, 1848, according to which the Catholic Apostolic Roman religion is the 
  only State religion.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 2</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy recognizes the sovereignty of the 
  Holy See in international matters as an inherent attribute in conformity with 
  its traditions and the requirements of its mission to the world.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 3</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy recognizes the full ownership, 
  exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Holy See 
  over the Vatican as at present constituted, together with all its 
  appurtenances and endowments, thus creating the Vatican City, for the special 
  purposes and under the conditions hereinafter referred to.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boundaries of the said City are set 
  forth in the map called Annex I of the present Treaty, of which it is forms an 
  integral part.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is furthermore agreed that, although 
  forming part of the Vatican City, St. Peter's Square shall continue to be 
  normally open to the public and shall be subject to supervision by the Italian 
  police authorities, which powers shall cease to operate at the foot of the 
  steps leading to the Basilica, although the latter shall continue to be used 
  for public worship. The said authorities shall, therefore, abstain from 
  mounting the steps and entering the said Basilica, unless and except they are 
  requested to do so by the proper authorities.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the Holy See consider it 
  necessary, for the purpose of special ceremonies, temporarily to prohibit the 
  public from free access to St. Peter's Square, the Italian authorities shall 
  (unless specially requested to do otherwise) withdraw to beyond the outer 
  lines of Bernini's Colonnade and the extension thereof.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 4</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sovereignty and exclusive 
  jurisdiction over the Vatican City, which Italy recognizes as appertaining to 
  the Holy See, forbid any intervention therein on the part of the Italian 
  Government, or that any authority other than that of the Holy See shall be 
  there acknowledged.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 5</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purpose of the execution of the 
  provisions of the preceding Article before the present Treaty comes into 
  force, the Italian Government shall see to it that the territory forming the 
  Vatican City shall remain free from any charge and from possible occupants. 
  The Holy See shall arrange to enclose the access thereto, enclosing such parts 
  thereof as remain open, except St. Peter's Square.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is furthermore agreed that, in 
  respect of the buildings there existing and belonging to religious 
  institutions or bodies, the Holy See shall settle relations with the latter 
  direct, the Italian Government having no part in such arrangements.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 6</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy shall provide, by means of 
  suitable agreements entered into with the interested parties, that an adequate 
  water supply be fully assured to the Vatican City. Italy shall furthermore 
  provide for connection with the State railways by constructing a railway 
  station within the Vatican City on the spot shown on the annexed map, and by 
  permitting the circulation of railway carriages belonging to the Vatican on 
  the Italian railways. It shall further provide for direct connection with 
  other States by means of telegraph, telephone, wireless, broadcasting, and 
  postal services in the Vatican City. It shall equally also provide for the 
  coordination of all other public services.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All expenses connected with the 
  arrangements above mentioned shall be defrayed by the Italian State, within 
  the period of one year from the entry into force of the present Treaty.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy See shall, at its own expense, 
  arrange the existing means of access to the Vatican, and those others which it 
  may consider it necessary to make in the future.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agreements shall be subsequently 
  concluded between the Holy See and Italy concerning the circulation, on and 
  over Italian territory, of land vehicles and aircraft belonging to the Vatican 
  City.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 7</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Italian Government undertakes to 
  prohibit the construction within the territory surrounding the Vatican City, 
  of any new buildings which might overlook the latter, and shall for a like 
  purpose provide for the partial demolition of similar buildings already 
  standing near the Porta Cavalleggeri and along the Via Aurelia and the Viale 
  Vaticano.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the provisions of 
  International Law, it shall be forbidden for aircraft of any kind whatsoever 
  to fly over Vatican territory.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Piazza Rusticucci, and in the 
  areas adjoining the Colonnade, over which the extra-territoriality referred to 
  in Article 15 hereof does not extend, all structural alterations or street 
  construction shall only be effected by mutual assent.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 8</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the person of the Supreme 
  Pontiff to be sacred and inviolable, Italy declares any attempt against His 
  person or any incitement to commit such attempt to be punishable by the same 
  penalties as all similar attempts and incitements to commit the same against 
  the person of the King.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All offences or public insults committed 
  within Italian territory against the person of the Supreme Pontiff, whether by 
  means of speeches, acts, or writings, shall be punished in the same manner as 
  offences and insults against the person of the King.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 9</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In accordance with the provisions of 
  International Law, all persons having a permanent residence within the Vatican 
  City shall be subject to the sovereignty of the Holy See. Such residence shall 
  not be forfeited by reason of the mere fact of temporary residence elsewhere, 
  unaccompanied by the loss of habitation in the said City or other 
  circumstances proving that such residence has been abandoned.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On ceasing to be subject to the 
  sovereignty of the Holy See, the persons referred to in the preceding 
  paragraph, who, according to the provisions of Italian law (independently of 
  the <em>de facto</em> circumstances considered above) shall not be regarded as 
  possessing any other citizenship, shall be regarded in Italy as Italian 
  nationals.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding that all such persons 
  are subject to the sovereignty of the Holy See, the provisions of Italian law 
  shall be applicable to them within the territory of the Kingdom of Italy, even 
  in such matters wherein the personal law must be observed (when they are not 
  covered by the regulations emanating from the Holy See) and, in the case of 
  persons of foreign nationality, the legal provisions of the State to which 
  they belong.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 10</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such dignitaries of the Church and 
  persons belonging to the Papal Court as shall be indicated in a Schedule to be 
  approved by the High Contracting Parties, shall always and in every case, even 
  when not citizens of the Vatican, be exempt from military service as far as 
  Italy is concerned, jury service, and any other service of a personal nature.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This provision shall also apply to 
  regular officials whose services are considered indispensable by the Holy See, 
  if permanently employed by the latter and earning a fixed salary, or employed 
  in the Departments or Offices mentioned in Articles 13, 14, 15, and 16 hereof 
  and residing without the Vatican City. The names of such officials shall be 
  set forth in another Schedule to be drawn up and approved as above mentioned, 
  and which shall be brought up to date each year by the Holy See.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ecclesiastics whose duty it shall be 
  to participate, without the Vatican City, in the execution of enactments 
  emanating from the Holy See, shall not, on that account, be subject to any 
  hindrance, investigation, or molestation on the part of the Italian 
  authorities.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All foreigners in official 
  ecclesiastical employment in Rome shall enjoy the personal guarantees 
  appertaining to Italian citizens, in accordance with the laws of the Kingdom 
  of Italy.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 11</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All central bodies of the Catholic 
  Church shall be exempt from any interference on the part of the Italian State 
  (save and except as provided by Italian law in regard to the acquisition of 
  property made by <em>corpi morali,</em> [recognized public bodies] and with 
  regard to the conversion of real estate.)</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 12</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy recognizes the right of the Holy 
  See to passive and active Legation, according to the general rules of 
  International Law. Officials accredited by foreign Governments to the Holy See 
  shall continue to enjoy, within the Kingdom of Italy, all the prerogatives of 
  immunity enjoyed by diplomatic agents under International Law, and their 
  headquarters may continue to be within Italian territory whilst enjoying the 
  immunity due to them under International Law, even in the event of their State 
  not having diplomatic relations with Italy.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is understood that Italy undertakes 
  in all cases to allow the freedom of correspondence for all States, including 
  belligerents, to and from the Holy See, as well as free access to the 
  Apostolic See by Bishops from all over the world.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The High Contracting Parties undertake 
  to establish normal diplomatic relations between each other, by accrediting an 
  Italian Ambassador to the Holy See and a Papal Nuncio to Italy, who shall be 
  the <em>doyen</em> of the Diplomatic Corps, in accordance with the ordinary 
  practice recognized by the Congress of Vienna by the Act of June 9, 1815, in 
  consequence of the sovereignty hereby recognized and without prejudice to the 
  provisions of Article 19 hereof, the diplomats accredited by the Holy See and 
  the diplomatic couriers dispatched in the name of the Supreme Pontiff, shall 
  enjoy within Italian territory, even in time of war, the same treatment as 
  that enjoyed by diplomatic personages and couriers of other foreign 
  Governments, according to the provisions of International Law.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 13</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy recognizes the full ownership of 
  the Holy See over the patriarchal Basilicas of St. John Lateran, Sta. Maria 
  Maggiore, and St. Paul, with their annexed buildings.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The State transfers to the Holy See the 
  free management and administration of the said Basilica of St. Paul and its 
  dependent Monastery, also paying over to the Holy See all monies representing 
  the sums set aside annually for that church in the budget of the Ministry of 
  Education.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also understood that the Holy See 
  shall remain the absolute owner of the edifice of S. Callisto, adjoining Sta. 
  Maria in Trastevere.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Article 14</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy recognizes the full ownership by 
  the Holy See of the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo, together with all 
  endowments, appurtenances, and dependencies thereof, which are now already in 
  the possession of the Holy See, and Italy also undertakes to hand over, within 
  six months after the coming into force of the present Treaty, the Villa 
  Barberini in Castel Gandolfo, together with all endowments, appurtenances, and 
  dependencies thereof.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to round off the property 
  situated on the northern side of the Janiculum Hill, belonging to the Sacred 
  Congregation of Propaganda Fide and to other ecclesiastical institutions, 
  which property faces the Vatican Palaces, the State undertakes to transfer to 
  the Holy See or other bodies appointed by it for such purpose, all real estate

  properties belonging to the said Congregation and to other institutions and 
  those to be transferred being marked on the annexed map.</p>

  Holy See, as its full and absolute property, the Convent buildings in Rome 
  attached to the Basilica of the Twelve Holy Apostles and to the churches of 
  San Andrea della Valle and S. Carlo ai Catinari, with all annexes and 
  dependencies thereof, and shall hand them over within one year after the entry

  Scossacavelli, the Vicariato, and all other edifices in which the Holy See 
  shall subsequently desire to establish other offices and departments although 
  such edifices form part of the territory belonging to the Italian State, shall 
  enjoy the immunity granted by International Law to the headquarters of the 
  diplomatic agents of foreign States. Similar immunity shall also apply with 
  regard to any other churches (even if situated outside Rome) during such time 
  as, without such churches being open to the public, the Supreme Pontiff shall 
  take part in religious ceremonies celebrated therein.</p>

  together with the requisite liberty and independence, the pastoral 
  administration of the Roman Diocese and the Catholic Church throughout Italy

  TREATY<i><font face="Times New Roman"><sup> ±</sup></font></i></p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy See and Italy having in consequence 
  of the stipulations of the Treaty which has definitely composed ' the Roman 
  Question ' held it necessary to regulate with a distinct convention, forming 
  an integral part of the same, their financial relations;</p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The supreme Pontiff considering on the one 
  hand the immense damage sustained by the Apostolic See through the loss of the 
  patrimony of S. Peter constituted by the ancient Pontifical States, and of the 
  Ecclesiastical property, and on the other side, the ever-increasing needs of 
  the Church in the City of Rome alone, and taking into consideration the 
  present financial condition of the State and the economic condition of the 
  Italian people, especially after the war, has deemed it well to restrict the 
  request for indemnity to the barest necessity; asking for a sum partly in cash 
  and partly in bonds which is much inferior in value to the which the State 
  to-day should disperse towards the Holy See if only in execution of the 
  obligation assumed by the law of May 13, 1871.</p>
  <p ALIGN="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Italian State appreciating the paternal 
  sentiments of the Supreme Pontiff has felt bound to adhere to the request for 
  the payment of the said sum.</p>
  <p ALIGN="justify"><b>Art. 1.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Italy, on the exchange of 
  ratifications of the Treaty, shall pay to the Holy See the sum of Italian lire 
  750,000,000 (seven hundred and fifty millions) and a the same time consign 
  Italian 5 per cent bonds (with coupons, June 30) of the nominal value of 
  Italian lire 1,000,000.</p>
  <p ALIGN="justify"><b>Art. 2.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy See declares that it 
  accepts the above as a definite systemization of the financial relations with 
  Italy in consequence of the events of 1870.</p>
  <p ALIGN="justify"><b>Art. 3.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the acts necessary for the 
  execution of the Treaty with regard to the present Convention and of the 
  Concordat shall be exempt from every form of taxation.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that from the beginning of the 
  negotiations between the Holy See and Italy for the solution of ' the Roman 
  Question ' the Holy See itself has proposed that the Treaty relating to the 
  said question should be accompanied, as its necessary complement, by a 
  Concordat to regulate the conditions of religion and the Church in Italy.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that to-day a Treaty has been concluded 
  and signed for the solution of ' the Roman Question.'</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; His Holiness the Supreme Pontiff Pius XI and 
  His Majesty Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy, have resolved to make a 
  Concordat and to that end have nominated the same Plenipotentaries delegated 
  for the stipulation of the Treaty, that is: on the part of His Holiness, His 
  Eminence the Most Reverend Lord Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, his Secretary of 
  State; and on the part of His Majesty, His Excellency Cav. Benito Mussolini, 
  Prime Minister and head of the Government, who having exchanged their full 
  powers and found them to be in good and due form, have agreed upon the 
  following articles:</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Art. 1.</b> Italy, in the sense of Art. I 
  of the Treaty, assures the Catholic Church of the free exercise of her

  their clergy and all the faithful. Like the Holy See the Bishops can freely 
  publish and affix within and to the external doors of buildings destined for 
  public worship or for the offices of their ministry, instructions, ordinances, 
  pastoral letters, diocesan bulletins and other ads concerning the spiritual 
  government of the faithful which they see fit to issue in the sphere of their 
  competence.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Such publications and affixions and in general 
  all the acts and documents relative to the spiritual government of the 
  faithful shall not be subject to any taxation.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Such publications as regards the Holy See may 
  be made in any language, those of the Bishops in Italian or Latin, but besides 
  the Italian text the Ecclesiastical Authority can adjoin translations into 
  other languages.</p>

  of military service.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Clerics ordained ' <i>in sacris</i> ' and 
  religious who have made their vows are exempt from military service, saving 
  the case of a general mobilization. In such case the priests pass into the 
  armed forces of the State, but conserve their ecclesiastical habits in order 
  to exercise amongst the troops their sacred ministry under the ecclesiastical 
  Jurisdiction of the military ordinary in the sense of Art. 14. The other 
  clerics and religious of preference shall be destined to military service.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, even in the case of a general 
  mobilization, those priests are dispensed from the call to present themselves 
  who have cure of souls. As such are considered ordinaries, parish priests, 
  vice-parish priests and coadjutors, vicars and priests permanently appointed 
  to rectories and churches open to the public. </p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The revocation of the <i>nihil obstat</i> 
  deprives the Ecclesiastic of the capacity of continuing to exercise the 
  employment or office which he has assumed.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, apostate priests, or those 
  subject to censure, cannot be appointed or continued as teachers, or hold

  definitive sentence of the judgment both in the first grade and also on 
  appeal.</p>

  it. In such a case the authority should immediately proceed to inform the same

  is committed the high direction of the service of spiritual assistance (the 
  military ordinary, the Vicar-General and the inspectors) shall be made 
  confidentially by the Holy See to the Italian Government. Whenever the Italian 
  Government has reason to oppose such designation, it shall communicate the

  at present do not enjoy it, composing those that formerly belonged to 
  Ecclesiastical entities now suppressed, with the assignment in regard to these
