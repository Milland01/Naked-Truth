  <blockquote>
    <p>The first Catholic source to be considered here is St. Alphonsus De
    Liguori [1696-1787] who was canonized a Saint in 1839 and proclaimed a
    Doctor of the Church by Pope Pius IX on July 7th, 1871. What follows are
    excerpts from the <em>Dignity and Duties of the Priest, </em>which was
    written as an instructional guide especially for the clergy of the Catholic
    Church.</p>
    <p>Now, if I were to state that Jesus was the <em>divine</em> Son of God the
    Father, noone would doubt that by those words I am stating that Jesus is
    deity, no less so than the Father. Please note the many times in which Mary
    is referred to as the <em>divine</em> Mother by Liguori. While Liguori and
    Catholics surely do not specifically claim that Mary is deity, you will see
    that they have indeed elevated her to a position that is second only to God,
    and at times materially indistinguishable from God.</p>
    <p>(Bold text in the body of the following quotes are my own emphasis, and
    text in squared brackets are added for the convenience of the reader.)</p>

    <p align="center"><strong>DEVOTION TO THE MOST HOLY MARY</strong></p>
    <p>(This instruction may serve either for an instruction or for a sermon;
    but whether it be given in the form of an instruction or of a sermon, the
    person who gives the spiritual exercises to the priests is entreated not to
    omit this discourse, which is, perhaps, the most fruitful of all; for
    without devotion to the <strong>divine Mother</strong> it is morally
    impossible for any one to be a good priest.)</p>
    <p>Let us, first, consider the moral necessity of the intercession of Mary
    for priests; and secondly, the confidence which they ought to have in the
    prayers of this <strong>divine Mother.</strong></p>
    <p align="left">[pg. 414]</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>II.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Confidence that we should have in the Intercession of the Mother
    of God.</strong></p>
    <p>Let us now pass to the confidence which we ought to have in the
    intercession of Mary, on account of her power and mercy.</p>
    <p>I. As to her power. Cosmas of Jerusalem has called the intercession of
    our Queen not only powerful, but <strong>omnipotent.</strong> And Richard of
    St. Laurence has written: &quot; From the omnipotent Son <strong>the Mother
    was made omnipotent.</strong>&quot; The Son is omnipotent by nature, the
    Mother of grace, inasmuch as she obtains from God whatsoever she asks. ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 415]<br>
    And St. George of Nicomedia has written, that Jesus Christ, in order to
    discharge the obligations that he owed in a certain manner to Mary for
    having given him his human nature, grants whatever she asks from him. Hence
    St. Peter Damian has gone so far as to say, that when Mary goes to Jesus to
    ask a favor for any of her clients &quot;she approaches the altar of human
    reconciliation; not asking, but <strong>commanding</strong>, not as a
    servant, but as a mistress; for the Son honors her by not refusing her
    anything.&quot; ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 416]<br>
    Hence St.George, Archbishop of Nicomedia, says, <strong>O great Mother of
    God: &quot;Thou hast insuperable [unsurpassable] strength,</strong> since
    the multitude of our sins does not outweigh thy clemency. <strong>Nothing
    resists thy power,</strong> for the Creator regards thy honor as his own.
    ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Omnipotence is an attribute unique to God, and means totally unlimited
  power. It is a term that can never be applied to a mere human being.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 419]<br>
    Let us always have recourse to this <strong>divine Mother,</strong> who
    knows not how to let any one who invokes her aid depart without consolation,
    says Blosius. ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 421]<br>
    Every little act of devotion is sufficient to secure the patronage of this <strong>divine
    Mother.</strong> ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 422]<br>
    Blessed Edminco, Bishop, began every sermon by the praises of Mary. This was
    so pleasing to the <strong>divine Mother,</strong> that she one day said to
    St. Bridget: &quot;Tell that prelate that I will be a mother to him, and
    that at death I will present his soul to my Son.&quot; ...</p>
    <p align="center">[pg. 442]<br>
    <strong>8. DEVOTION TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN.</strong></p>
    <p>He [the priest] should endeavor to conceive a great confidence and a
    tender devotion to the Blessed Virgin. All the saints are always fond of
    nourishing in their hearts a filial piety towards this <strong>divine
    Mother.</strong> ...</p>

  <p>Source: <i>Dignity and Duties of the Priest or Selva</i>, by St. Alphonsus
  De Liguori, edited by Rev. Eugene Grimm, published by the Redemptorist

  <p>Next we will look at the teaching of St. Louis-Marie Grignion De Montfort
  [1673-1716] who was canonized a Saint in 1947. What you are about to read has
  been endorsed by no less than eight popes (to include John Paul II) and also
  the Vatican II Council, which are all quoted in the opening pages of the
  document. Note that De Montfort also refers to Mary as divine, but a footnote
  attempts to explain this away.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong><u>St. Louis-Marie Grignion De Montfort</u></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 4, Extract from the Preliminary Remarks by St. Louis De Montfort]</p>
    <p>5. Mary is the excellent masterpiece of the Most High, the knowledge and
    possession of which He has reserved to Himself. Mary is the admirable Mother
    of the Son, who took pleasure in humbling and concealing her during her life
    in order to favor her humility, calling her by the name of &quot;woman&quot;
    (<em>Jn.</em> 2:4; 19:26), as if she were a stranger, although in His heart
    He esteemed and lover her above all the angels and all men, Mary is the
    &quot;sealed fountain&quot; (<em>Cant.</em> 4:12), the faithful spouse of
    the Holy Ghost, to whom He alone has entrance. Mary is the sanctuary and the
    repose of the Holy Trinity, where God dwells more magnificently and more
    divinely than in any other place in the universe, not excepting His dwelling
    between the Cherubim and Seraphim. Nor is any creature, no matter how pure,
    allowed to enter into that sanctuary except by a great and special
    privilege.</p>
    <p>6. I say with the saints, the <strong>divine</strong> (2) Mary is the
    terrestrial paradise of the New Adam [Jesus], where He was made flesh by the
    operation of the Holy Ghost, in order to work there incomprehensible
    marvels. She is the grand and <strong>divine</strong> world of God, where
    there are beauties and treasures unspeakable. She is the magnificence of the
    Most High, where He hid, as in her bosom, His only Son, and in Him all that
    is most excellent and most precious.</p>
    <p>[pg. 7]<br>
    (2.) &quot;... the word 'divine' may be used without attributing the nature
    of divinity to the person on thing thus qualified. We speak of our own
    prayers, whether addressed to God or to His saints, as a 'divine service.'
    The Psalmist [82:6] speaks of us all as being gods and sons of the Most
    High; and yet no one takes offense, because the sense given to the words
    uttered is understood. Mary may be called 'divine' because divinely chosen
    for the divine office of Mother&quot; of a divine Person, Jesus Christ.
    (Cardinal Vaughan, Preface to the English edition of <em>True Devotion</em>).</p>
    <p>[pg. 16]<br>
    27. Inasmuch as grace perfects nature, and glory perfects grace, it is
    certain that Our Lord is still, in Heaven, as much the Son of Mary as He was
    on earth; and that, consequently, He has retained the obedience and
    submission of the most perfect Child toward the best of all mothers. But we
    must take great pains not to conceive this dependence as any abasement or
    imperfection in Jesus Christ. For Mary is infinitely below her Son, who is
    God, and therefore she does not command Him as a mother here below would
    command her child who is below her. <strong>Mary, being altogether
    transformed into God</strong> by grace and by the glory which transforms all
    the saints into Him, asks nothing, wishes nothing, does nothing contrary to
    the eternal and immutable will of God. When we read that in the writings of
    Sts. Bernard, Bernardine, Bonaventure and others that in Heaven and on earth
    everything, even <strong>God Himself, is subject to the Blessed Virgin</strong>,
    they mean that the authority which God has been well pleased to give her is
    so great that [pg. 17] it seems as if she had the same power as God; and
    that her prayers and petitions are so powerful with God that they always
    pass for commandments with His Majesty, who never resists the prayer of His
    dear Mother, because she is always humble and conformed to His will.</p>
    <p>If Moses, by the force of his prayer, stayed the anger of God against the
    Israelites in a manner so powerful that the most high and infinitely
    merciful Lord, being unable to resist him, told him to let Him alone that He
    might be angry with and punish that rebellious people, what must we not,
    with much greater reason, think of the prayer of the humble Mary, that
    worthy Mother of God, which is more powerful with His Majesty than the
    prayers and intercessions of all the angels and saints both in Heaven and on
    earth.</p>
    <p>28. In the Heavens Mary commands the angels and the blessed. As a
    recompense for her profound humility, God has empowered her and commissioned
    her to fill with saints the empty thrones from which the apostate angels
    fell by pride. The will of the Most High, who exalts the humble (Lk. 1:52),
    is that <strong>Heaven, earth and Hell bend, with good will or bad will, to
    the commandments of the humble Mary,</strong> whom He has made sovereign of
    Heaven and earth, general of His armies, treasurer of His treasures,
    dispenser of His graces, worker of His greatest marvels, restorer of the
    human race, Mediatrix of men, the exterminator of the enemies of God, and
    the faithful companion of His grandeurs and triumphs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Catholics will routinely deny that they are involved in any worship of
  Mary, and Catholic documents are normally very careful to describe this
  &quot;veneration&quot; of Mary as a lesser form of devotion than is due to
  God. It is indeed rare to find a Catholic scholar who will use the word
  worship in connection with Mary, which makes the following two quotes of great
  interest:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 18]<br>
    The most infallible and indubitable sign by which we may distinguish a
    heretic, a man of bad doctrine, a reprobate, from one of the predestinate,
    is that the heretic and the reprobate have nothing but contempt and
    indifference for Our Lady, endeavoring by their words and examples to
    diminish the <strong>worship</strong> and love of her, openly or hiddenly,
    and sometimes by misrepresentation. Alas! God the Father has not told Mary
    to dwell in them, for they are Esaus. ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 69]<br>
    115. There are several interior practices to true devotion to the Blessed
    Virgin. Here are the principle ones, stated compendiously: (1) to honor her
    as the worthy Mother of God, with the <strong>worship</strong> of
    hyperdulia; that is to say, to esteem her and honor her above all the other
    saints, as the masterpiece of grace, and the first after Jesus Christ, true
    God and true Man; ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 39]<br>
    63. I here turn for one moment to Thee, O sweet Jesus, to complain lovingly
    to Thy Divine Majesty that the greater part of Christians, even the most
    learned, do not know the necessary union there is between Thee and Thy holy
    Mother. Thou, Lord, art always with Mary, and Mary is always with Thee, and
    she cannot be without Thee, else she would cease to be what she is. <strong>She
    is so transformed into Thee [Jesus] by grace that she lives no more,</strong>
    she is as though she were not. It is Thou only, my Jesus, who livest and
    reignest in her more perfectly than in all the angels and the blessed. Ah!
    if we knew the glory and the love which Thou receivest in this admirable
    creature, we should have very different thoughts both of Thee and her from
    what we have now. She is so intimately united with Thee that it were easier
    to separate the light from the sun, the heat from the fire; nay, it were
    easier to separate from Thee all the angels and the saints than the divine
    Mary, because she loves Thee more ardently and glorifies Thee more perfectly
    than all the other creatures put together.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note the following two paragraphs, in which De Montfort chastises those
  Catholics who exalt and promote the worship of Jesus but do something less
  with regard to Mary, that they even dare to suggest that Mary's importance has
  been exaggerated by the Church. De Montfort goes on to proclaim that Mary and
  Jesus are really one; and indistinguishable.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>64. After that, my sweet Master, is it not an astonishing pitiable thing
    to see the ignorance and the darkness of all men here below in regard to Thy
    holy Mother? I speak not so much of idolators and pagans, who, knowing Thee
    not, care not to know her. I speak not even of heretics and schismatics, who
    care not to be devout to Thy holy Mother, being separated as they are from
    Thee and Thy holy Church; but I speak of Catholic Christians, and even of
    doctors among Catholics, who make profession of teaching [pg. 40] truths to
    others, and yet know not Thee nor thy holy Mother, except in a speculative,
    dry, barren and indifferent manner. These gentlemen speak but rarely of Thy
    holy Mother and of the devotion we ought to have to her, because they fear,
    so they say, lest we should abuse it, and do some injury to Thee in honoring
    Thy holy Mother too much. If they hear or see anyone devout to our Blessed
    Lady, speaking often of his devotion to that good Mother in a tender, strong
    and persuasive way, and as a secure means without delusion, as a short road
    without danger, as an immaculate way without imperfection, and as a
    wonderful secret for finding and loving Thee perfectly, they cry out against
    him, and give him a thousand false reasons by way of proving to him that <strong>he
    ought not to talk so much of our Blessed Lady; that there are great abuses
    in that devotion; and that we must direct our energies to destroy these
    abuses, and to speak of Thee, rather than to incline the people devotion to
    our Blessed Lady, whom they already love sufficiently.</strong></p>
    <p>We hear them sometimes speak of devotion to our Blessed Lady, not for the
    purpose of establishing it and persuading men to embrace it, but to destroy
    the abuses which are made of it; and all the while these teachers are
    without piety or tender devotion toward Thyself, simply because they have
    none for Mary. They regard the Rosary and the Scapular as devotion toward
    Thyself, simply because they have none for Mary. They regard the Rosary and
    the Scapular as devotions proper for weak and ignorant minds, without which
    men can save themselves; and if there falls into their hands any poor client
    of Our Lady who says his Rosary, or has any other practice of devotion
    toward her, they soon change his spirit and his heart. Instead of the
    Rosary, they counsel him the seven Penitential [pg. 41] Psalms. <strong>Instead
    of devotion to the holy Virgin, they counsel him devotion to Jesus Christ.</strong></p>
    <p>[pg. 105]<br>
    It is quite true that in the view of other creatures, however holy, may
    perhaps at certain times retard divine union. But this cannot be said of
    Mary, as I have remarked before and shall never weary of repeating. One
    reason who so few souls come the the fullness of the age of Jesus Christ is
    that Mary, who is as much as ever the Mother of the Son, and as much as ever
    the fruitful spouse of the Holy Ghost, is not sufficiently formed in their
    hearts. He who wishes to have the fruit well ripened and well formed must
    have the tree that produces it; he who wishes to have the fruit of life,
    Jesus Christ, must have the tree of life, which is Mary; he who wishes to
    have in himself the operation of the Holy Ghost must have His faithful and
    inseparable spouse, the <strong>divine Mary,</strong> who makes Him fertile
    and fruit bearing, as we have said elsewhere.</p>
    <p>165. Be persuaded, then, that the more you look at Mary in your prayers,
    contemplations, actions, and sufferings, if not with a distinct and definite
    view, at least with a general and imperceptible one, the more perfectly you
    will find Jesus Christ, who is always, with Mary, great, powerful, active
    and incomprehensible - more than in Heaven or in any other creature. Thus,
    so far from the <strong>divine Mary,</strong> all absorbed in God, being an
    obstacle to the perfect in attaining union with God, there has never been up
    to this time, and there never will be, any creature who will aid us more
    efficaciously in this great work; ...</p>
    <p>[pg. 155]<br>
    246. A second reason is that the principal mystery we celebrate and honor in
    this devotion is the mystery of the Incarnation, wherein we can see Jesus
    only in Mary, and incarnate in her bosom. Hence it is more to the purpose to
    speak of <strong>the slavery of Jesus in Mary</strong>, and of Jesus
    residing and reigning in Mary, according to that beautiful prayer of so many
    great men: &quot;O Jesus, living in Mary, come and live in us in the spirit
    of sanctity,&quot; etc.</p>
    <p>247. Another reason is that this manner of speaking sets forth still more
    the intimate union between Jesus and Mary. They are so intimately united
    that the one is altogether in the other. Jesus is altogether in Mary and <strong>Mary
    is altogether in Jesus; or rather, she exists no more, but Jesus alone is in
    her,</strong> and it were easier to separate the light from the sun than
    Mary from Jesus; so that we might call Our Lord, &quot;Jesus of Mary,&quot;
    and Our Blessed Lady, &quot;Mary of Jesus.&quot;</p>

  <p>The above citations show that the movement now underway to infallibly
  proclaim Mary the Co-redeemer and Mediatrix of all graces, as well as the
  other Marian dogmas already proclaimed, are rooted in the deepest, darkest
  apostasy and blasphemy about Mary that one can imagine. Mary is worshipped as
  being in a position approaching divinity, with omnipotence, supreme power and
  authority, that supposedly even her obedient son Jesus cannot oppose her will.</p>
  <p>It should be stated, most emphatically, that I believe most Roman Catholics
