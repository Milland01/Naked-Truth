<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is
in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:<br>
Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: ...</p>
    <p align="left">Acts 19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone
at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded
and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are
made with hands:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Note that the commandment of God forbids making and
bowing down to images. Among pagans, perhaps the most common form of
idolatry is sun worship, and the above prohibition would clearly
exclude bowing down before images of the sun or moon (things in the
heaven above). But then God gets even more explicit:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Deu 17:2 If there be found among you, within any of
thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath
wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
his covenant,<br>
Deu 17:3 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,
either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not
commanded;<br>
Deu 17:4 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and inquired
diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such
abomination is wrought in Israel:<br>
Deu 17:5 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that
woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.</p>
    <p align="left">Jer 8:1 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall
bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his
princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets,
and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:<br>
Jer 8:2 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and
all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have
served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and
whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried;
they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.<br>
Jer 8:3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue
of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places
whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">With that in mind, lets look at solar and lunar
images directly associated with the Catholic Mass.</p>

this wafer of bread turns into the actual body of Christ when
consecrated during the Mass.&nbsp;</td>

sun-monstrance with a circular window surrounded by a silver or gold

  <blockquote>
    <p>The most appropriate form (for the monstrance) is that of the
sun emitting its rays to all sides (Instructio Clement., 5). [See Altar
Vessels: Ostensorium]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr align="center" size="2" width="30%">
  <p>Notice the letters SFS in the small sunburst blaze on the large
close up of a Monstrance above? Each of the letters is a universal
symbol for the number 6 in the pagan mysteries, so to the pagan it
reads <strong>666</strong>! The number 666 is also associated with
what is called the "<em>magic square of the sun</em>". The practice of
equating names and letters with numbers is called <i>gematria</i>.</p>
  <blockquote> <b><u> </u></b>
    <p><b><u>The letter F:</u></b></p>
    <p>The Hebrew letter Vau (V) has a value of 6. The English letter F
is a descendant of Vau and retains the same value. The letter F is also
the 6th letter of the English alphabet. In pagan numerology the letters
F, O, and X have the value of 6.</p>
    <p>The Greek symbol Digamma also looks like the letter F and has a
value of 6.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="digamma.gif" height="30" width="85"></p>
    <p><b><u>The letter S:</u></b></p>
    <p>The Greek equivalent of Vau is the letter Stau, which looks like
an S, and it also has the value of 6.</p>

bread they believe has actually turned into the actual body and blood
of Jesus after being consecrated by a priest. Since the wafer, they
believe, has been transformed into God Himself, it is the round wafer
god <em> inside</em> the sunburst monstrance that they bow down to in
worship, not the sunburst monstrance. However, the round wafer of bread
          <i> itself</i> is also a sun symbol, which is sometimes made

Hominum Salvator (Jesus Saviour of Men), although according to the
Catholics themselves they actually represent the first three letters of
the name "Jesus" in Greek (spelled in Greek
iota-eta-sigma-omicron-upsilon-sigma). The pagan though, would quickly
see the same sun disk symbol associated with many pagan deities of
Egypt, among them Isis, Horus, and Seb. In Egyptian mythology Seb (Geb)
was the father of the goddess Isis (Aset), the mother and protectress
of her divine son Horus (Harpocrates). Horus (the younger) is
frequently depicted on Egyptian temples as a winged sun disk,
representing the rays of the rising sun.</td>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you think this is what Jesus had in mind at the Last Supper?
No, when He "broke bread" He handed His disciples a <i>torn fragment</i>
of unleavened bread, that symbolized His sinless broken body on the
cross, but this is NOT what is conveyed with a pressed, round, intact
and unbroken wafer that has been so commonly used.</p>
  <p>Now, a Catholic might respond: <i>the manna that fell from heaven
was ROUND</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon
the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
the hoar frost on the ground.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Voila! The round disk-like wafer host of the Mass is a copy of
God's manna!</i></p>
  <p>No. Not, so fast. Note that scripture give us a description of
manna in size, shape, color and taste:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 16:14 And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the
surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, as fine as
frost on the ground. [NKJV]</p>
    <p>Exo 16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna:
and it was like coriander seed [in size and shape], white [color]; and
the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. [KJV]</p>
    <p>Num 11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed [in size and
shape], and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium [white].<br>
Num 11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. [KJV]</p>
    <p>Psa 78:24 he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave
them the grain of heaven. [NIV]<br>
Psa 78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given
them of the corn of heaven. [KJV]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b><u>The size and shape of manna</u></b></p>
  <p>Exodus 16:14 tells us manna was small, small like the frost on the
ground. We are also told in Exodus and Numbers that manna was like
Coriander seed. Coriander is common today, and is used in brewing beer.
It is round <i>like a ball</i>, and quite <i>small</i>. Eight to ten
Coriander seeds might fit in the space of a pea. A picture of one ounce
(hundreds) of <img src="star.gif" height="12" width="16"> <a
 href="http://www.brewsource.com/ProdNav/Ing_163.asp"><b>Coriander
Seeds.</b></a><b> </b>So Coriander is a miniscule round seed.</p>
  <p>In Psalm 78 manna is further described as the <i>grain</i> or <i>corn</i>
of heaven. In Strong's the word in Psalm 78 is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>H1715. dagan, daw-gawn'; from H1711; prop. increase, i.e.
grain:--corn ([floor]), wheat.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Manna, therefore, was small and round like a ball, similar to a
small seed grain.</p>
  <p><b><u>The color of manna</u></b></p>
  <p>The meaning of bdellium is somewhat uncertain, however, similar
words in other languages favor identification with a resinous gum. In
droplet form, the gum may have the appearance of a pearl, white. Exodus
16:31 confirms that manna was white in color by plainly stating it.</p>
  <p><b><u>The taste of manna</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 16:31 ... the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</p>
    <p>Num 11:8 ... the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>As described in the Bible, manna resembled Coriander in size and
shape: it was like a grain, like a small white round ball-like seed
which was collected, ground up, and baked to make cakes, like wheat is
ground to make bread. So, no, the Catholic wafer host does <i>not</i>
imitate manna in either <i>size</i> or <i>shape</i>.</p>

  <blockquote> <b> </b>
    <p><b>1378</b> <i>Worship of the Eucharist.</i> In the liturgy of
the Mass we express our faith in the real presence of Christ under the
species of bread and wine by, among other ways, genuflecting or bowing
deeply as a sign of adoration of the Lord. "The Catholic church has
always offered and still offers to the sacrament of the Eucharist the
cult of adoration, not only during Mass, but also outside of it,
reserving the consecrated host with the utmost care, exposing them to
the solemn veneration of the faithful, and carrying them in procession."</p>

  <p>So the Catholic Church describes itself in its documents as
engaged in the act of <b> <i>worshipping</i></b> the Eucharist, which
is also called adoration or veneration. Isn't it amazing how the
Catholic Church justifies bowing down before images of the sun, as
depicted by the monstrance and a round wafer, by claiming the bread has
actually <em>become</em> God! God's commandment is cleverly made of no
effect by the Traditions of men, by mixing error and truth.</p>

  <p>Incredibly enough, the woman representing faith (the Catholic
Church) on the reverse side of the coins holds up a cup in her right
hand, in which you see pagan sunburst wafer god, which recalls these
verses in Revelation:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:4 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour,
and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden
cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</p>
    <p>Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication
with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the
abundance of her delicacies.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><img src="closeup.jpg" height="237" width="345"></p>
  <p>The cup of wine of the apostate woman (church) represents
spiritual and doctrinal fornication, a mixing of truth and error,
Christianity and paganism, which she has taught to the world (made the
nations drink).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:5 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY,
BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is only one self-proclaimed "Mother" church, The Universal
(Catholic) Church.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out
of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues.<br>
Rev 18:5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
her iniquities.</p>
