  Catholics are actually taught that the priest has it in his power to transform 
  bread and wine into God!</p>
  <p>These alleged changes of the bread and wine into God Himself are not

    <p>But our wonder should be far greater when we find that in obedience to 
    the words of his priests - HOC EST CORPUS MEUM - God himself descends on the 
    altar, that he comes wherever they call him and as often as they call him, 
    and places [pg. 27] himself in their hands, even though they should be be 
    his enemies. And after having come, he remains, entirely at their disposal 
    they move him as they please, from one place to another, they may, if they 
    wish, shut him up in the tabernacle, expose him on the altar, or carry him 
    outside the church; they may, if they choose, eat his flesh, and give him 
    for the food of others. &quot;Oh, how very great is their power,&quot; says St. 
    Lawrence Justinian, speaking of priests. &quot;A word falls from their lips and 
    the body of Christ is there substantially formed from the matter of bread, 
    and the Incarnate Word descended from heaven, is found really present on the 
    table of the altar! Never did divine goodness give such power to the angels. 
    The angels abide by the order of God, but the priests take him in their 
    hands, distribute him to the faithful, and partake of him as food for 
    themselves.&quot;</p>

  <hr>
  <p>The Council of Trent (1545-1563) declared in the canons of the Most Holy 
  Sacrament of the Eucharist: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. If anyone denies that the body and blood, together with the soul and 
    divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore, the whole Christ is 
    truly, really, and substantially contained in the sacrament of the most holy 
    Eucharist, but says that Christ is present in the Sacrament only as in a 
    sign or figure, or by his power: let him be anathema.</p>
    <p>2. If anyone says that the substance of bread and wine remains in the 
    holy sacrament of the Eucharist together with the body and blood of our Lord 
    Jesus Christ, and denies that wonderful and extraordinary change of the 
    whole substance of the bread into Christ's body and the whole substance of 
    the wine into his blood while only the species of bread and wine remain, a 
    change which the Catholic Church has most fittingly called 
    transubstantiation: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>3. If anyone denies that in the venerable sacrament of the Eucharist the 
    whole Christ is contained under each species and under each and every 
    portion of either species when it is divided up: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>4. If anyone says that after the consecration the body and blood of our 
    Lord Jesus Christ are not present in the marvelous sacrament of the 
    Eucharist, but are present only in the use of the sacrament while it is 
    being received, and not before or after, and that the true body of the Lord 
    does not remain in the consecrated hosts or particles that are kept or are 
    left over after the Communion: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>5. If anyone says that the principle effect of the most holy Eucharist is 
    the forgiveness of sins, or that other effects do not come from the 
    Eucharist: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>6. If anyone says that Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, is not to be 
    adored in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist with the worship of latria, 
    including the external worship, and that the Sacrament, thererfore, is not 
    to be honored with extraordinary festive celebrations nor solemnly carried 
    from place to place in processions according to the praiseworthy universal 
    rite and custom of the holy Church; or that the Sacrament is not to be 
    publicly exposed for the people's adoration, and that those who adore it are 
    idolators: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>7. If anyone says that it is not permissible to keep the sacred Eucharist 
    in a holy place, but that it must necessarily be distributed immediately 
    after the consecration to those who are present; or that it is not 
    permissible to carry the Eucharist respectfully to the sick: let him be 
    anathema. </p>
    <p>8. If anyone says that Christ present in the Eucharist is only 
    spiritually eaten and not sacramentally and really as well: let him be 
    anathema. </p>
    <p>9. If anyone denies that each and everyone of Christ's faithful of both 
    sexes, is bound, when he reaches the age of reason, to receive Communion at 
    least every year during the Paschal season according to the command of holy 
    Mother Church: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>10. If anyone says that it is not permissible for a priest celebrating 
    Mass to give Communion to himself: let him be anathema. </p>
    <p>11. If anyone says that faith alone is a sufficient preparation for 
    receiving the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist: let him be anathema. 
    And, lest this great sacrament be received unworthily and thus be received 
    unto death and condemnation, this holy council has determined and decreed 
    that those who have mortal sin on their conscience, no matter how contrite 
    they may think they are, must necessarily make a sacramental confession 
    before receiving, provided that they have access to a confessor. If anyone 
    presumes to teach, or preach, or stubbornly maintain, or defend in public 
    disputation the opposite of this, he is excommunicated by his action. </p>

    <p>Bishops and priests being, as they are, God's interpreters and 
    ambassadors, empowered in His name to teach mankind the divine law and the 
    rules of conduct, and holding, as they do, His place on earth, it is evident 
    that no nobler function than theirs can be imagined. Justly, therefore, are 
    they called not only Angels, but even gods, because of the fact that they 
    exercise in our midst the power and prerogatives of the immortal God.</p>
    <p>In all ages, priests have been held in the highest honor; yet the priests 
    of the New Testament far exceed all others. For the power of consecrating 
    and offering the body and blood of our Lord and of forgiving sins, which has 
    been conferred on them, not only has nothing equal or like it on earth, but 
    even surpasses human reason and understanding. </p>

    <center>
    <p><em>Power of Consecrating</em></p>
    </center>
    <p></p>
    <p>The third great power of the priestly office is the climax of all. It is 
    the power of consecrating. &quot;No act is greater,&quot; says saint Thomas, &quot;than the 
    consecration of the body of Christ.&quot; In this essential phase of the sacred 
    ministry, the power of the priest is not surpassed by that of the bishop, 
    the archbishop, the cardinal or the pope. Indeed it is equal to that of 
    Jesus Christ. For in this role the priest speaks with the voice and the 
    authority of God Himself.</p>
    <p>When the priest pronounces the tremendous words of consecration, he 
    reaches up into the heaven, brings Christ down from His throne, and places 
    Him upon our altar to be offered up again as the victim for the sins of man. 
    It is a power greater than that of monarchs and emperors. It is greater than 
    that of saints and angels, greater than that of Seraphim and Cherubim. 
    Indeed, it is greater than the power of the Virgin Mary. While the blessed 
    virgin was the human agency by which Christ became incarnate a single time, 
    the priest brings Christ down from heaven, and renders Him present on our 
    altar as the eternal victim for the sins of man-not once, but, a thousand 
    times! The priest speaks and lo! Christ the eternal and omnipotent God, bows 
    His head in humble obedience to the priest's command. </p>
    <p>[pg.271] Of what sublime dignity is the office of the Christian priest 
    who is thus privileged to act as the ambassador and the vicegerent of Christ 
    on earth. He continues the essential ministry of Christ - he teaches the 
    faithful with the authority of Christ, he offers up again the same sacrifice 
    of adoration and atonement which Christ offered on Calvary. No wonder that 
    the name which spiritual writers are especially fond of applying to the 
    priest is that of &quot;alter Christus.&quot; For the priest is and should be another 
    Christ. </p>

  <hr>
  <p>Now that the Roman Catholic teaching has been presented, just what does the 
  Bible say on the matter? The Passover meal celebrated by Jesus and His 
  disciples the evening before the crucifixion is found in the following 
  passages-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and 
    brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my 
    body.<br>
    Mat 26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, 
    Drink ye all of it;<br>
    Mat 26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many 
    for the remission of sins.</p>
    <p>Mark 14:22 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake 
    it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.<br>
    Mark 14:23 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to 
    them: and they all drank of it.<br>
    Mark 14:24 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, 
    which is shed for many. </p>
    <p>Luke 22:17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and 
    divide it among yourselves:<br>
    Luke 22:18 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, 
    until the kingdom of God shall come.<br>
    Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto 
    them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance 
    of me.<br>
    Luke 22:20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new 
    testament in my blood, which is shed for you. </p>
    <p>1 Cor 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, 
    eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
    1 Cor 11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, 
    saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye 
    drink it, in remembrance of me.<br>
    1 Cor 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do 
    show the Lord's death till he come.<br>
    1 Cor 11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of 
    the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.<br>
    1 Cor 11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, 
    and drink of that cup.<br>
    1 Cor 11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh 
    damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Well, it looks like an open and shut case in favor of Roman Catholic 
  teaching, doesn't it? Who could dispute the clear meaning of the above 
  passages? The above passages plainly state that the bread and wine are in 
  fact, the body and blood of Jesus Christ... well don't they? If you read 
  strictly at an absolutely literal level you can only reach this conclusion. 
  But did Jesus always speak only on a literal level?- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou 
    unto them in parables?<br>
    Mat 13:11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to 
    know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.<br>
    Mat 13:12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more 
    abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he 
    hath.<br>
    Mat 13:13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see 
    not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.<br>
    Mat 13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By 
    hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, 
    and shall not perceive:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So there were times that Jesus spoke symbolically in parables, so that 
  unbelievers would not comprehend what He said, but the faithful would 
  understand the spiritual significance of His teaching. So in some cases, there 
  are two levels to the teaching of Jesus, the absolute literal, which will not 
  be comprehended by the unbeliever, and the true symbolic spiritual meaning 
  that would be discerned by the people of God. Let's look at a related passage 
  and interpret it first on a strictly literal level: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: <u>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he that 
    cometh to me</span></u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> shall never hunger;</span> and
    <u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he that believeth on me</span></u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> shall never 
    thirst.</span><br>
    John 6:36 But I said unto you, That <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
    ye also have seen me, and </span><u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
    believe not</span></u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">.</span><br>
    John 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that 
    cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.<br>
    John 6:38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will 
    of him that sent me.<br>
    John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all 
    which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again 
    at the last day.<br>
    John 6:40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that 
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">every one which </span>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">seeth</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> the Son, and 
    </span><u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">believeth on him</span></u><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">, may have everlasting life:</span> and I will 
    raise him up at the last day.<br>
    John 6:41 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread 
    which came down from heaven.</p>
    <p>John 6:48 I am that bread of life.<br>
    John 6:49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.<br>
    John 6:50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may 
    eat thereof, and not die.<br>
    John 6:51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat 
    of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my 
    flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.<br>
    John 6:52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this 
    man give us his flesh to eat?<br>
    John 6:53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except 
    ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in 
    you.<br>
    John 6:54 <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Whoso </span>
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">eateth</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> my flesh, and 
    </span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">drinketh</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> my blood, hath eternal life</span>; 
    and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>
    John 6:55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.<br>
    John 6:56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, 
    and I in him.<br>
    John 6:57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he 
    that eateth me, even he shall live by me.<br>
    John 6:58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your 
    fathers did eat manna, and are dead: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">he that
    </span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">eateth</span><span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> of this bread shall live 
    for ever. </span> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, on a literal level Jesus is really bread and those who believe on him 
  and eat his flesh and drink his blood will never get hungry or thirsty, they 
  have eternal life, living forever. Note that the unbelieving Jews were 
  perplexed by this? The literal surface meaning confused them. How could they 
  possibly eat the flesh and drink the blood of this Jesus? On the same literal 
  level, let me ask the following: Do Catholics ever get hungry or thirsty 
  (v.35)? Don't Catholics die (vs. 50, 58)? If the above passage is literally 
  true, then all Catholics who have died, been thirsty or hungry, have 
  apparently lacked the faith described above and are lost souls as a result.
  </p>
  <p>Obviously, the above passage from John is not to be read absolutely 
  literally. So, clearly Jesus was<strong> <em>not speaking literally</em></strong> 
  of eating His flesh and blood, but rather <strong><em>symbolically or 
  parabolically</em></strong> of the Passover meal, with the bread symbolic of 
  His broken body and the wine symbolic of His shed blood. </p>
  <p>So, what is the purpose of the Lord's supper? </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave 
    unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in 
    remembrance of me.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, 
    eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
    </p>
    <p>1 Cor 11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do 
    show the Lord's death till he come. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Lord's supper is a commemoration or memorial to the death of Jesus 
  Christ on the cross as the Lamb of God, offered for the sins of the world. So 
  what does it mean to partake unworthily <nobr>(1 Cor 11:27)?</nobr> </p>
  <p>The Bible speaks symbolically of the process of <strong><em>eating and 
  drinking</em></strong> to actually mean the process of <strong><em>
  understanding</em></strong>: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat 
    this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.<br>
    Ezek 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.<br>
    Ezek 3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill 
    thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in 
    my mouth as honey for sweetness.<br>
    Ezek 3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of 
    Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p>
    <p>Jer 15:16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto 
    me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD 
    God of hosts. </p>
    <p>Rev 10:9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little 
    book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy 
    belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.<br>
    Rev 10:10 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; 
    and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my 
    belly was bitter. </p>
    <p>John 4:14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall 
    never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of 
    water springing up into everlasting life. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again, these passages are not literally speaking of eating or drinking 
  anything. To eat the roll, words, or book or drink the water actually means to 
  understand the words of God. Such understanding is likened to the sweetness of 
  honey and causes rejoicing.</p>
  <p>Eating is also equated with gaining knowledge in the garden of Eden- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that 
    it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she 
    took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with 
    her; and he did eat.<br>
    Gen 3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were 
    naked;...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Eating from the forbidden fruit in the tree of knowledge suddenly opened 
  the eyes of Adam and Eve, and they now had knowledge of evil and knew they 
  were naked!</p>
  <p>So then, what does it mean to &quot;eat&quot; the body of Christ, or &quot;drink&quot; His 
  blood? Is it literal? No, Jesus was speaking symbolically of our understanding 
  the reason for His death on the cross. He died in your place, for your sins, 
  and if you have faith in His atonement for you, if you understand and 
  acknowledge this, then you are to partake in the Passover meal or Communion to 
  bring to mind and commemorate His death on the cross. By doing so, you are 
  also openly confessing Jesus Christ has fully paid the price for your sins. 
  The ceremony itself, however, is not magical and does nothing of itself. Yet, 
  if the ignorant or unbelieving partake of the Lord's supper, they do so 
  unworthily, since they do not understand the sacrifice Christ has made for 
  them at the cross, and by such ignorance they eat and drink damnation, not 
  understanding the death of Christ for their sins! This faith in His death for 
  us is the very foundation of the Gospel message - Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><span class="itembody">&quot;Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man,&quot; says 
  Christ, &quot;and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.&quot; This seems to enjoin a 
  crime or a vice; it is therefore a figure, enjoining that we should have a 
  share in the sufferings of our Lord, and that we should retain a sweet and 
  profitable memory of the fact that His flesh was wounded and crucified for us.</span></p>

      <td width="100%" valign="middle">So, when properly understood, the 
      Passover meal known as the Lord's Supper or Communion, or Eucharist, is an 
      important but <em>symbolic</em> commemoration of the death of Jesus 
      Christ, which the faithful partake in periodically as a public 
      acknowledgement of their faith, an expression of understanding, and by the 
      faith they confess their sins are forgiven by a loving God. This is 
      something the Roman Catholic Church utterly fails to understand, just like 
      the Jews of Christ's time, hence the condemnation Roman Catholicism 
      proclaims in ignorance on anyone who would deny what they call 
      transubstantiation, or the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. By 
      adoring or worshipping pieces of bread and calling them God, they are in 
      fact engaged in an act of idolatry, despite their protests to the 
      contrary.</td>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Catholic version of the Scriptures makes Jesus 
    say: &quot;Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy holy 
    one to see corruption.&quot; Acts ii. 27.&nbsp; Now every wafer swallowed by 
    Catholics enters the physical system, and corrupts with the decaying body, 
    if not sooner. Every fragment of Christ's body that ever entered the stomach 
    of one of the faithful, has seen corruption already in the bodies of all the 
    dead, or will see it in the mouldering remains of all the living.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every miracle of Christ was an apparent miracle; it could be 
    tested by the senses; and the wonder had to be acknowledged by friend and 
    foe. When he turned the water into wine at the wedding, let us suppose that 
    it had the taste of water still, and its clear appearance; and that he and 
    his mother assured the festive company that their senses deceived them, that 
    it was really wine. How many at the marriage would have believed Jesus? Such 
    a statement would have blasted the Saviour's veracity forever among these 
    people. Or when he feeds the thousands with the five loaves and two fishes, 
    let us suppose that the miracle is of the</p>
    <p>[p. 196]</p>
    <p><i>mass order, that there is no increase of the loaves and fishes of 
    which the people have any sensible evidence. </i>He breaks them in little 
    pieces, giving a portion to each: when the hungry multitude swallow the 
    little morsels, they cry out: &quot;What folly to give us these atoms!&quot; Says 
    Jesus: &quot;I have magnified them by miracle into a sufficiency to satisfy you 
    all.&quot; &quot;You have!&quot; they reply. &quot;It looked small, it felt small, it tasted 
    small.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; he replies, &quot;but your senses deceive you, you cannot trust 
    them.&quot; If the Saviour had been capable of such a piece of imposition, these 
    thousands would have branded him as the most deceitful and barefaced 
    trickster that ever tried to take advantage of human credibility. <i>Every 
    miracle</i> of Jesus <i>appeared </i>a supernatural occurrence to those who 
    beheld it. The mass shows no change. It appears <i>bread</i>, its friends 
    say it is <i>flesh and blood; </i>it is certainly a case of <i>false</i> 
    appearances; it is no miracle of Jesus. His were all <i>real, visible, 
    undoubted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A story is told of the celebrated Duke of Buckingham, 
    that he consented to receive the ministrations of a priest during an 
    illness. The duke, even in sickness, loved a joke, and as the father made 
    some effort to convert him, he feigned a sort of dreamy unconsciousness of 
    his presence. He held a cork in his hand, which he treated as if it were a 
    splendid horse; he spoke of it height, its action, its beauty, and addressed 
    it as an old equine acquaintance. The priest tried to convince him that it 
    was not a horse, that he was certainly mistaken; that if he would look at it 
    he would see it was not a horse but only a cork; that if he would taste it 
    he would be satisfied that it was a cork; that if he would feel it he would 
    perceive it was but a cork; that if he would listen to it for years he would 
    never hear the snorts, neighing or breathing of a horse. The duke professed 
    his conviction that it was only a cork. As conversation progressed, the 
    eucharist was introduced, and the priest declared it to be Jesus Christ, 
    soul, body, and divinity. The duke expressed his astonishment at the 
    statement of the father; intimated that he must be somewhat beside himself: 
    for it you touch it you will understand that is was not a human body, if you 
    look at it you can only receive that conviction, if you</p>
    <p>[p. 197]</p>
    <p>taste it you will discover nothing but water and flour; if you scent it 
    you will find no odor of flesh and blood. And he informed the father that a 
    man must be out of his mind who believed a thing so contrary to his senses.*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We receive all knowledge through our senses. If we cannot 
    believe each of them in its own limited sphere, when each is in healthful 
    exercise, we are not safe in believing anything. Our taste, touch, scent, 
    sight, testify that the priest's wafer is not Christ's body and blood, but 
    the flour and water of the cook. He tells us that it is Christ's body, but 
    he gives no evidence to establish the truth of the statement, except such 
    testimony as would prove Christ to be a literal rock, lamb, corner-stone, 
    sun, door, vine, shepherd, or morning star, between which objects and Jesus, 
    in some features of his person or work, there is such a resemblance as led 
    him to be called by their names; or such evidence as would prove Peter, the 
    foundation of the Romish Church, to be the devil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were the keen old satirist living who laughed so immoderately 
    at the follies of Egyptian idolatry, and who derisively complimented that 
    people in the well-known words: <font face="Times New Roman"> &quot;Oh holy 
    nations, for whom these divinities grow in the gardens!&quot; with what 
    cultivated, heathen scorn, he would address his degenerate Roman fellow 
    citizens, and exclaim: &quot;Oh happy pontiff! O blessed papal fold, whose god 
    grows in every ear of wheat, whose divinity is made by a baker and a priest, 
    and then swallowed!&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The human body of Christ is in heaven; and as no material 
    substance can be in two places at one time, or in a hundred thousand places 
    at one time, the wafer-body of Christ is an imposition, a plain, unmitigated 
    counterfeit, the reception of which is not an act of faith, but a deed which 
    flings away the Bible and common sense for an impious dogma which the 
    Scriptures never taught, and a soul exercising its intelligence could not 
    believe.</font></p>
