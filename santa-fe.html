  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Why the Supreme Court Decision is a
  Victory<br>
  for the Constitution and Religious Freedom<br>
  in the Santa Fe school prayer case.</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p>My understanding of the Santa Fe school prayer case in Galveston, Texas, is
  this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A student election decided whether or not to give a pre-game student
      message.</li>
    <li>If a message was voted for, another student election decided which
      student would give the message.</li>
    <li>The elected student could then decide what the message would be,
      religious or non religious.</li>
    <li>If a prayer was selected, it could only be a non denominational, non
      proselytizing prayer.</li>
    <li>The stated <i>secular</i> purpose of the student message was to
      &quot;solemnize and dignify the football game&quot;.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now here is why this is blatantly unconstitutional. The school district, an
  agent of the state, was sanctioning a process whereby the majority of the
  student body (presumably Southern Baptist) determined who would conduct a
  prayer service at school (state) sponsored events. The election process
  virtually guaranteed that minority religions would not get equal access. The
  school (state) also was in a position of setting the guidelines to which the
  prayer, if any, would conform to, as it had to be non denominational and non
  proselytizing (in effect the state was exercising the power of prior
  censorship over the content of prayer). Two students, a Catholic and a Mormon,
  objected that this was a violation of church-state separation, and they were
  right. The majority religion, through the power and sanction of the state, was
  trying to subject a multi-religious audience to a religious service /
  &quot;Christian prayer&quot; under the pretence of blessing or sanctifying a
  game of violence. Majority rule (under state auspices) in religion is <i>precisely</i>
  what the constitution was trying to prevent.</p>
  <p>This ruling does <i>not</i> prohibit prayer in the school, or in the
  stadium before, during, or after the game, by individuals or groups. It does
  prohibit state control and sanction of prayer over the school (state)
  controlled stadium sound system, which is coercive in nature, i.e. forcing the
  entire audience in the stands to hear the prayer, when there are surely those
  who object to it in principle and in content.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 6:5 <font color="#FF0000">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as
    the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
    the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto
    you, They have their reward.</font><br>
    Mat 6:6 <font color="#FF0000">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
    closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
    secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>How does forcing your prayer onto a large crowd through the power and
  sanction of the state harmonize with what Jesus said? Isn't it a case of the
  &quot;religious right&quot; wanting to take control of a high-power
  state-owned sound system to pray, and to be seen of men doing so? Jesus
  Himself calls them <i>hypocrites!</i></p>
