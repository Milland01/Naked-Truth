<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up 
    out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten 
    crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.<br>
    Rev 13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet 
    were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the 
    dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.<br>
    Rev 13:3 <strong>And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death</strong>; 
    and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.<br>
    Rev 13:4 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and 
    they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able 
    to make war with him?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Even before the Reformation, students of Bible prophecy had long identified 
  the papal power as the antichrist, and the beast from the sea of Revelation 
  13. So the following verse, in conjunction with verse three above, prophesied 
  something of great interest to the diligent student of some 200 years ago:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and 
    blasphemies; <strong>and power was given unto him to continue forty and two 
    months</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>The 42 two months end with imprisonment and death:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that 
    killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience 
    and the faith of the saints.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This predicted a limited reign of the papacy, which would be inflicted with 
  a deadly wound, almost to death, after a period of 42 months of rule. This 42 
  months of prophetic time can be shown from scripture to be an actual period of 
  1260 years. See my article

  <p>After having reached its zenith in the middle ages, the papal power went 
  into a long period of gradual decline, and the French Revolution, which began 
  in 1789, abruptly cast off the Catholic yoke and religion in general. This 
  caught the attention of many Bible scholars, who began to take a hard look at 
  the prophecy and tried to determine just when this &quot;deadly wound&quot; to the 
  papacy might be expected. Here is an extract from <font size="3"><em>The 
  PROPHETIC FAITH OF OUR FATHERS, </em>by Le Roy Edwin Froom, which illustrates 
  one example of just how closely the date of the papal wound was calculated, 
  some two years in advance of the event:</font></p>

          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By many voices in different lands 
          and through various vehicles the end of the papal period was perceived 
          as due and under way. The sudden shock of the French Revolution sent 
          the Protestant church back to the Scriptures for the meaning. Thus in 
          the Edinburgh <em>Missionary Magazine</em> for 1796 the fact was 
          publicized that the reign of Antichrist was hastening toward its end. 
          Note it:</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;By the general consent of 
          prophecy, the reign of Antichrist, is now hastening to an end. The 
          aspect of providence, for some time past, has quickened our 
          expectation of his fall. This will pave the way for the overthrow of 
          every system by which the empire of iniquity and error has been 
          maintained; and this again will be succeeded by the age of 
          righteousness and truth.&quot;[20]</font></p>

          <p><font size="3">christ,&quot; written July 24, 1795. He contends first 
          that though man may not presumptuously inquire into God's secrets, it 
          is our duty to seek knowledge of those things He has revealed. Then he 
          asserts that God often overrules the actions of men to bring to pass 
          entirely different objectives. He then comes directly to the time of 
          the rise and fall of Antichrist, based on the internal evidence of the 
          prophecy. First, its rise would not be until after Western Rome's 
          division, and we are therefore &quot;not to look for his appearance before 
          the year 407.&quot;[21]</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. BELIEVES ANTICHRIST AROSE 
          ABOUT 537. </font>—<font size="3"> Again, he would not appear until 
          after the &quot;subversion of the imperial government of Rome,&quot; and &quot;this 
          obstacle was taken out of the way in the year 476.&quot; It would appear 
          soon thereafter, but &quot;not instantly.&quot;[22] Bell's third point is based 
          on the seven heads or governments, the sixth being the emperors </font>
          —<font size="3"> that form falling in 476 under Augustulus. Then the 
          Gothic kings chose Ravenna as their seat of government, but held Italy 
          from 476 to 553 </font>—<font size="3"> but &quot;lost the government of 
          Rome in the year 537.&quot;[23] So the papal was to follow the imperial. He 
          concludes:</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="2">&quot;If this be 
          a right application of events to the prophecy, then Antichrist arose 
          about the year 537, or at farthest about the year 555. He continues 42 
          months, or 1260 prophetical days, that is, 1260 years, Rev. xiii.5.; 
          consequently we may expect his fall about the year 1797, or 1813.&quot;[24]</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. DATING THE 1260, 1290, AND 
          1335 PERIODS. </font>—<font size="3"> Turning next to the evidence 
          from Daniel, Bell alludes to the oft-repeated 1260 years, or forty-two 
          months, or three and a half times, during which Antichrist will 
          &quot;scatter the power of the holy people.&quot;[25] The 1290 years &quot;takes its 
          date from a time of remarkable apostasy.&quot; Of this period Bell says:</font></p>
          <p><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The holy city is to be trodden 
          under foot by the Gentiles, or Papists, who, though they are 
          Christians in name, are Gentiles in worship and practice; worshiping 
          angels, saints, and images, and persecuting the followers of Christ. 
          These Gentiles take away the daily sacrifice, and set up the 
          abomination that maketh the visible church of Christ desolate for the 
          space of 1260 years. But this is a longer period by 30 years.&quot;[26]</font></p>

          REVOLUTION. </font>—<font size="3"> The second article concentrates on 
          the Justinian date when, after the Ostrogothic withdrawal to Ravenna, 
          the army of Belisarius approached Rome, which opened its gates to the 
          Roman general in December, 537; tracing the transfer of the Roman 
          emperor to Constantinople, and then the shift of the Goths to Ravenna, 
          Bell says the pope is left, &quot;as it were, the governor and principal at 
          Rome.&quot;[28] Then, logically coming to the predicted earthquake, which 
          &quot;signifies a revolution,&quot; and France as the tenth part of the 
          Babylonian City</font>—<font size="3">when &quot;One of the ten kingdoms 
          under the dominion of Rome would fall off, or revolt from her 
          jurisdiction&quot;</font>—<font size="3">he declares, &quot;Have we not seen, in 
          one of the ten kingdoms, a most astonishing revolution? Have we not 
          also seen that kingdom fall off of the papal jurisdiction?&quot; Bell then 
          concludes, saying, &quot;Have we not good ground to hope that the 
          accomplishment of the prophecies, respecting the rising of the 
          witnesses and the fall of antichrist, is near at hand?&quot;[29] ...</font></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immediate problem is to trace the overthrow 
          of the Papacy in Italy in 1798. One of the most interesting accounts, 
          as well as a very trustworthy one, of the overthrow of the papal 
          government is by Richard Duppa,[1] in <em>A Brief Account of the 
          Subversion of the Papal Government, 1798</em>.[2] Of this work Duppa 
          says, &quot;It was written with the strictest attention to truth; the facts 
          were recorded by one who was witness to the events.&quot; And he adds, 
          &quot;After a lapse of nine years, no part has been invalidated.&quot;[3]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. NAPOLEON'S GOAL WAS FREEING OF ROME. — In 1796 Napoleon 
          Bonaparte, on his way to overthrow the pope, incited his soldiers with 
          one of his fiery speeches to the effect that they still had one 
          offense to avenge. The hour of vengeance had struck. To restore the 
          Capitol, to awaken the people of Rome, blunted from centuries of 
          slavery, were to be the fruits of their victories; they would mark an 
          epoch in history. Hearing of this, Pius VI (1775-1798)—born in 1717 as 
          Giovanni Angelico Braschi, and died in 1799—attempted to fortify his 
          position and</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="2">1 Richard Duppa (1770-1831), English 
          lawyer, writer, and artist, studied art in Rome as a youth. Educated 
          at Trinity College, Oxford, and Middle Temple, he received an L.L.B. 
          from Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was also an F.S.A. Duppa published a 
          dozen works, besides classical schoolbooks, travels in Europe, and 
          biographies of Michaelangelo, Raphael, and others.<br>

          <p><font size="3">neglected nothing that might prevent the great 
          catastrophe. Meantime he sent an emissary to Napoleon at Milan and 
          proposed an armistice, offering heavy reparations and the surrender of 
          Ancona, Bologna, and Ferrara—the northern portion of the papal 
          territory.[4]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French Directory demanded that the Papacy revoke, 
          retract, and disannul all bulls, briefs, rescripts, and decrees 
          affecting ecclesiastical affairs in France issued since the beginning 
          of the Revolution in 1787. This Pius VI refused, declaring he would 
          oppose it with force, and broke off the parley. Napoleon took Imola, 
          the Romagna, the duchy of Urbino, routed the papal army, and made new 
          overtures to the pope.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. TOLENTINO FOLLOWED BY KILLING OF DUPHOT. — The Directory 
          wished Napoleon to destroy the Papacy,[5] and directed that no 
          successor to Pius VI be elected to the papal chair. It hoped as a 
          consequence, to deliver Europe from the papal supremacy.[6] But 
          Bonaparte negotiated the Treaty of Tolentino, on February 19, 1797, by 
          which the Pope was to abandon Avignon, Venaissin, Bologna, Ferrara, 
          and Romagna (Peter's patrimony), in addition to heavy indemnities.[7] 
          The papal treasury was unable to meet the monetary demand, and the 
          populace of Rome was showing increasing hostility to the papal 
          government. The pope could scarcely appear in public without being 
          hissed.[8] Revolution was in the air. Incendiary placards were posted 
          on the one hand, and on the other the French were exposed to 
          increasing insults. A crisis approached.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Bonaparte was sent to Rome as French ambassador, and 
          sought to quiet the situation. But on December 27, 1797, a riot 
          threatened, and the papal government ordered the mutineers to 
          disperse. Duppa records that some in the mob, &quot;proceeded to make 
          public harangues, and pretended to shew clearly,</font></p>

          advanced, and the revolutionists sought refuge at the French embassy. 
          The pontifical soldiers followed and opened fire. Then the French 
          general Duphot sought to quiet the melee, but was shot, and dispatched 
          with papal bayonets.[10]</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. BERTHIER'S TROOPS ENTER ROME 
          BY INVITATION. — The killing of General Duphot brought on the crisis. 
          The ambassador left Rome in indignation. Reparations were refused, and 
          the Directory, on January 1, 1798, ordered General Berthier,[11] then 
          in Milan, to march upon Rome and conquer it, and to establish a Roman 
          republic.[12]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Berthier advanced, but stopped outside of Rome, 
          awaiting an invitation to enter. Patriots invited him to do so. Thus 
          the French troops entered Rome on February 10, 1798. Berthier 
          immediately pledged by proclamation that the Catholic &quot;cult&quot; should 
          remain untouched.[13]</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. PROCESSIONAL LAUNCHED TO STAY 
          EVIL DAY. — As a last resort the church had had recourse to a vast 
          religious processional through the streets of Rome, with venerated 
          relics, in the hope of staving off the evil day. An elaborate 
          proclamation was issued January 15, 1798, in the form of a printed 
          poster[14] signed by the papal secretary. The three special relics 
          paraded were a portrait of the Saviour supposed to have been painted 
          by supernatural agency, a miraculous picture of the Virgin Mary and 
          the child, and the supposed chains by which St. Peter was 
          fettered.[15] These</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 LOUIS ALEXANDRE BERTHIER (1753-1815) prince of Wagram and 
          confidant and associate of Napoleon, was born at Versailles. He served 
          under Lafayette in the United States from 1778 to 1782, and at the 
          outbreak of the French Revolution was appointed major general of the 
          national guard at Versailles. By 1795 he had risen to chief of staff 
          of the Army of Italy, and as Napoleon's representative, proclaimed the 
          Republic of Rome and effected the captivitv of the pope in 1798. 
          Berthier accompanied Napoleon into Egypt as chief of staff, and aided 
          in victory over the Directory in 1799, becoming minister of war 
          (1799-1808). Made marshall of France in 1804, he was constantly at 
          Napoleon's side until 1814. In 1809 he became chief of the general 
          staff of the grand armée, and was created prince of Wagram in the same 
          year.<br>

          St. Peter's, and visited by the people of Rome and the surrounding 
          country. Prayer, fasting, and penitence were urged, and liberal 
          indulgences promised. But the French Army came on.[16] Priests went 
          throughout the city preaching the end of the world and, as customary, 
          calling on miracles to sustain their prophecies. They little dreamed 
          that they were so near the close of their power.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. ROMAN REPUBLIC IS 
          RE-ESTABLISHED. — Berthier called upon the commander of St. Angelo to 
          open the fort. He asked two days for decision, but Berthier gave only 
          four hours. So the fort was evacuated, three thousand French troops 
          taking possession, and taking over the city, with certain cardinals, 
          princes, and prelates as hostages to ensure quiet. From that moment 
          onward Pius VI confined himself to the Vatican. Heavy reparations were 
          exacted for the assassination of General Duphot. Then a petition, 
          drawn up and signed by the French partisans in Rome, demanding a 
          change of government and regime of liberty, was followed by an 
          imposing public demonstration. The Tree of Liberty was planted on the 
          capitol hill,[17] and the new government was established on Pluviose 
          27 (February 15), when the sovereignty of the people was proclaimed 
          and the re-establishment of the Roman Republic was effected.[18]</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. PAPAL ARMS AND INSIGNIA 
          REMOVED. — Berthier came to the capitol escorted by a military band, 
          received the acclaim of the great concourse, and gave formal 
          recognition to the Roman Republic and its provisional government.[19] 
          He then ordered the papal arms and insignia everywhere removed. Thus 
          the change was effected without bloodshed. Later when the Sacred

          for confiscated property, and their printing presses and type were 
          sent to France.[20] Vatican Palace was stripped of its valuables, and 
          the sacerdotal vestments of the pontifical chapels were burned for the 
          gold and silver of the embroidery.[21]</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. PIUS VI DETHRONED ON 
          ANNIVERSARY IN SISTINE CHAPEL. — Meantime, on this very same day — 
          February 15 — on the anniversary of his elevation to the pontificate, 
          Pius VI repaired to the Sistine Chapel, and was receiving the 
          felicitations of the Sacred College of cardinals, when, in the midst 
          of the ceremony, shouts penetrated the conclave, intermingled with the 
          strokes of axes on the doors. Soon General Haller, a Swiss Calvinist, 
          with a band of his soldiers, broke into the chapel, and declared that 
          the pope's reign was at an end.[22] (Painting appears on page 754.) 
          His Swiss guards were dismissed, and republican soldiers substituted. 
          Ferrara, Bologna, and Romagna (Peter's patrimony) were taken over, and 
          the cardinals were stripped of authority and possessions. Eight were 
          arrested and sent to the Civita Castellana.[23] The glory, honor, and 
          power had vanished. Soldiers were quartered in the papal palace. Such 
          was the stroke of the sword at Rome. It was the end of an epoch in 
          papal history long before predicted in the prophecies of Holy Writ. 
          Trevor goes so far as to say:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="2">&quot;The territorial possessions of the 
          clergy and monks were declared national property, and their former 
          owners cast into prison. The papacy was extinct: not a vestige of its 
          existence remained; and among all the Roman Catholic powers not a 
          finger was stirred in its defence. The Eternal City had no longer 
          prince or pontiff; its bishop was a dying captive in foreign lands; 
          and the decree was already announced that no successor would be

          the pope protested that the Tolentino Treaty had left him nothing, 
          Haller demanded and took the two rings on his fingers, including the 
          Fisherman's ring — though only by threat. (This was returned the 
          following day.) Haller told the prelate to be ready to leave the next 
          morning at six. He protested his age—of eighty-one—and illness, Haller 
          nevertheless insisted, and threatened force. Given forty-eight hours 
          to settle the affairs of the church, he was to leave before 
          daybreak.[25] (Painting of departure appears on page 754.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was still night, February 20, 1798, and stormy with 
          lightning and thunder, when the carriage crossed the city, preceded by 
          two men with torches — the guards pointing out the dome of St. 
          Peter's. Both hisses and prayers came from the crowd that had 
          assembled. Within ten days Pius VI had been dethroned. imprisoned, 
          exiled, his private library confiscated, his state given up to 
          plunder, and his subjects to military control. Reaching Sienna, Pius 
          and his party stopped at an Augustinian convent. But while they were 
          there, an earthquake destroyed several buildings. The Pontiff was 
          therefore housed outside the city in a country home called Hell, a 
          fact that elicited the sarcasm of the unbelieving.[26]</font></p>

          Next his transfer to Parma was decided upon, the departure to take 
          place at 2 A.M. As the pope was suffering from partial paralysis, his 
          guards had great difficulty in effecting the transfer. From here he 
          was taken to Turin, and finally to the French fortress at Valence, in 
          Dauphiny,[27] arriving there July 14, 1799, broken with fatigue and 
          sorrow. He died there on the 28th.[28]</font></p>

          and its ministers and for ambassadors, and warn French officers of 
          violation.[30] No. 5, dated Year 1, Pluviose 27 (Feb. 15, 1798), 
          announces that Berthier has appointed civil authorities in the six 
          territories of the republic. No. 7 gives a pompous speech of Berthier

          — certified and signed by three notaries, and confirmed by General Berthier — makes this clear-cut declaration:</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="2">&quot;The people 
          of Rome, long tired of the monstrous despotism under which they 
          groaned have on various occasions tried to shake off this yoke. The 
          magic of public opinion and political interests combined into a mighty 
          force have not allowed their efforts to succeed. And a despotism of 
          that nature becomes the more insulting the more its weakness and 
          arrogance corresponds to its misery. But at last, the people, fearing 
          to be exposed to an hideous anarchy and in despair to fall under even 
          a worse tyranny have mustered all their courage in order to evade 
          these sinister consequences and to reclaim the primitive rights of 
          their sovereignty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Assembled in the presence of the Eternal and the whole 
          universe, they solemnly and unanimously declare to have had no part 
          whatever in the crimes and assassinations committed by the government 
          against the French Republic and her nation. They disapprove of these 
          crimes and detest their originators and invoke upon them (vow them) 
          eternal shame.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They further have suppressed, abolished and crushed the 
          political, economic, and civil authorities of the former Roman 
          government and have constituted themselves a free and independent 
          sovereignty in taking up all executive and legislative powers which 
          its legitimate representatives shall exercise according to the 
          immortal rights of man based on the principles of truth, justice, 
          liberty, and equality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They have declared that their desire is that no attack 
          against religion or the spiritual authority of the pope should be made 
          and that they reserve to themselves the right by their representatives 
          to provide for the comfortable sustenance [of the Pope] and to ensure 
          the safety of his person by a national guard.<br>

          truth. The ministers of the sanctuary may henceforth-according to the 
          duties of their sublime institution—bring peace and consolation into 
          homes and hearts. The representatives of the Republic will ever keep

          piety and universal joy. — Thanks be therefore rendered unto thee, O 
          supreme and immortal Being, on whom the destiny of all creatures 
          depends. Touched, at last, by the woes which pressed upon us so 
          heavily: Monopoly, Favoritism, Privilege, and alas perhaps Religion

          French and Italian, includes a letter from the minister of foreign 
          affairs in Rome to Talleyrand, minister of foreign affairs in Paris, 
          dated February 28 (Ventose 10), giving notice that the Roman people 
          have chosen a new government comprising all the territory formerly 
          under the temporal power of the pope after the treaty of Campo-Formio. 
          It is signed &quot;Corona.&quot; Talleyrand's answer follows, expressing the 
          great satisfaction of the French Directory, and is dated Ventose 25.</font></p>
          <p align="center"><strong><font size="3">III. Code of Justinian and 
          the Code of Napoleon</font></strong></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is yet another factor which 
          was brought about by the French Revolution. The Revolution had given a 
          totally new concept to man of his dignity, his rights, his 
          relationship to his fellow men. There must follow, of necessity, a new 
          concept of law.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French had long felt the need of a new and more unified 
          law; therefore, the revolutionists promised, among other things, a new 
          code for the people. However, it needed the strong will and leadership 
          of Napoleon to complete the codification of civil laws. In 1804 this 
          task was finished and the code was accepted. This became the first 
          great codification of law since the time of Justinian. Under the 
          auspices of

          <strong><a href="jus-code.html">Justinian</a></strong>, Roman law was 
          codified by 529, and in an imperial rescript in 533 the Roman bishop 
          was recognized as the head of all the churches, and given full 
          authority as such. This recognition, as well as that of the canons of 
          the first four ecumenical councils, was incorporated into the 
          Justinian Code. Thus the Catholic faith was recognized as the only 
          orthodox religion of the empire, and the</font></p>

          <p><font size="3">two mighty forces of state and religion were legally 
          united.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in the first general codification of law after so many 
          centuries, a complete break between these two forces was achieved. The 
          French Civil Code contains nothing which savors of an allegiance of 
          the spiritual power of the pope and the state, and is far from giving 
          the pope any authority whatsoever. It is purely a secular code.</font></p>
          <p align="center"><strong><font size="3">IV. Retributive Character of 
          Deadly Wound</font></strong></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The retributive character of the 
          French Revolution should not be forgotten. In its sheer destructive 
          effects it was considered to constitute a judgment doubtless without a 
          parallel in human history.[33] It was directed primarily against 
          Catholicism, not Protestantism, and was a reaction against her 
          excesses. Terrible as was the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans 
          under Titus, says Guinness, it sinks to secondary place when compared 
          with the wholesale slaughter by massacre and war that first affected 
          France, then Italy, and other nations of Europe. &quot;If it inflicted 
          enormous evil, it presupposed and overthrew enormous evil.&quot;[34]</font></p>

          INFIDELITY AND IMMORALITY. — The France of St. Bartholomew — of the Wars 
          of the Huguenots, of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and of the 
          suppression of the Jansenists — was visited with a retributive plague 
          of infidelity and immorality that was fearful. The monarchy that had 
          banished the Huguenots was overthrown and abolished in a national 
          convulsion of revolutionary excess and crime wherein the restraints of 
          law and order gave way. The monarchy was brought to an end on the 
          scaffold, the aristocracy abolished, estates were confiscated, prisons 
          crowded, rivers choked with victims, churches desecrated, priests 
          slaughtered, religion suppressed, and the worship of a harlot as the 
          Goddess of Reason was substituted for the worship of the host on the 
          altars of the Roman church.[35]</font></p>

          CRASH TOGETHER. — France, a prey to infidelity, anarchy, and the 
          guillotine, then communicated revolution and antiecclesiasticism to 
          surrounding nations. Democratic revolution was succeeded by military 
          despotism. Italy, Austria, Germany, Poland, Spain, Portugal, and 
          Russia were invaded by the armies of France. Many Catholic nations 
          which had ruled for centuries were crushed by Napoleon. The Holy 
          Catholic Church and the remnant of the Holy Roman Empire were alike 
          prostrated—the empire and the papal crown going down in the common 
          ruin. They had stood side by side for a thousand years. The Holy Roman 
          Empire had risen with Charlemagne, who attempted to revive the 
          imperial power of the Caesars. He had combined Germany, Italy, and 
          France into a single empire, which had warred against and crushed the 
          Hussites, and had stood against Luther in the days of the Reformation, 
          inflicting on Germany the horrors of the Thirty Years War in the time 
          of Gustavus Adolphus. Now, stripped of Italian territory, driven back 
          from the plains of Lombardy, the Holy Roman Empire came to be totally 
          suppressed.</font></p>

          BLOODSHED AND MISERY. — Piedmont, which had suppressed and all but 
          exterminated the Waldenses, turning their valleys into 
          slaughterhouses, was in turn overrun by merciless invaders. Spain, 
          which had crushed the Reformation within her borders and in other 
          lands, by the horrors of the Inquisition and the auto-da-fé, was now 
          delivered over to dreadful bloodshed and misery, and during the seven 
          years of the Peninsular War the Inquisition was suppressed.</font></p>

          the pope was carried away captive to the camp of the infidels, to die

          <p><font size="3">&nbsp; The downfall of the papal 
          government excited little sympathy. The oppressions and the tyranny of 
          Rome over Christendom were remarked upon with bitterness. Many 
          rejoiced in the overthrow of a church which they considered 
          idolatrous, even though the overthrow was attended with the immediate 
          triumph of infidelity. When news of the papal defeat at Rome reached 
          Paris, Director Merlin declared that for fourteen centuries there had 
          been cumulative demand for the destruction of this power opposed to 
          society. And in the Court of the Ancients, Bordas actually held &quot;a 
          funeral oration of the Papacy,&quot; on March 14, 1798.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. BIBLE AND MISSIONARY SOCIETIES 
          HAVE BIRTH. — Papal hostility had been exerted in two ways: (1) By the 
          suppression of the Scriptures, and (2) by the torture and death of its 
          preachers and converts, which were effected by means of the 
          Inquisition. The French Revolution ended both—French arms abolishing 
          the Inquisition in France in 1798, and temporarily in Spain in 1808. 
          Moreover, the extraordinary circulation of the Scriptures began during 
          the French Revolution. Never should it be forgotten that both 
          missionary and Bible societies had their birth at this very time, the 
          British and Foreign in 1804, and the American in 1816.</font></p>

          — Begun in France, the spoliation of the fallen church and its head 
          had spread quickly to other countries of Europe, until the stroke of 
          the sword struck at Rome. The tempest of war gave it wings, sweeping 
          into Belgium and the Rhenish provinces of Germany, where 
          ecclesiastical changes similar to those in France took place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1796-1797 French dominion, established by Bonaparte's 
          victories in northern Italy, was similarly accompanied by French 
          Democratism and infidelity and antipapalism. Then Rome itself</font></p>

          forward on the papal capital.</font></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. LOOKED AS IF PAPACY WERE DEAD. 
          — In Rome all the cardinals were involved in the indiscriminate 
          proscription. Eight were imprisoned, and several renounced the Roman 
          purple and sought asylum away from Rome. It looked as if the Papacy 
          were dead. In fact, half of Europe thought &quot;the Papacy was dead.&quot;[37]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blood of the saints was avenged. France had for 
          years yielded the neck to the papal yoke, and helped to bind other 
          nations. Now she had abolished papal tithes, suppressed her 
          monasteries, confiscated her church lands, and despoiled her 
          priests.[38] Pennington says, &quot;The same God who visits the iniquities 
          of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation 
          had made him [the pontifical head of the church] the victim of His 
          retributive justice.&quot;[39]</font></p>
          <p align="center"><strong><font size="3">V. Papal Establishment and 
          Overthrow Are Counterparts</font></strong></p>
          <p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evidence is incontestable 
          that the eighteenth-century overthrow of the Papacy, stemming from the 
          French Revolution, was the clear counterpart of the sixth-century 
          papal establishment. Justinian first recognized by law the pope's 
          absolute ecclesiastical supremacy, and virtually gave the saints into 
          his hand, placing the civil sword at his ultimate disposal. And now, 
          1260 years later, springing from the French Revolution, the land that 
          for centuries had been the mainstay of the Papacy, abolished the 
          pope's age-old supremacy, declared the clergy totally independent of 
          the See of Rome, vested the election of bishops in departmental 
          authorities, made a national profession of atheism, and then actually 
          overthrew the papal government.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 533 was given the notable decree of Justinian, the pope's 
          powerful sixth-century supporter, recognizing his ecclesiastical 
          supremacy, And by a decisive stroke of the Roman sword at</font></p>

          <p><font size="3">Rome, in the spring of 538, the way was opened for a 
          new order of popes and the beginning of a new epoch. And now in 1793, 
          just 1260 years after Justinian's 533 imperial fiat, came the notable 
          decree of the Papacy's once powerful supporter, France oldest son of 
          the church—aimed at the abolition of church and religion, and their 
          unholy union with the state, followed by the decisive stroke of the 
          sword at Rome in overthrow of the Papacy in 1798 — an act marking the 
          end of the epoch begun 1260 years before.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two are clearly counterparts. In the first the supreme 
          civil power of the time was employed for the aggrandizement of the 
          pope, framing laws with that special objective in view, and subjecting 
          all spiritual authority to him. And now, in the reaction, the supreme 
          civil power of the hour was bent on the pope's overthrow, and on the 
          recovery of all the usurped political authority which he had assumed. 
          One was the beginning, and the other the termination, of an epoch 
          foreknown of God, and determined — perhaps unwittingly — by men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the chaos of falling kingdoms and decaying pagan 
          religions of the early centuries, the massive plans of the Papacy 
          occupied the central place. They formed the point of integration, and 
          constituted the principle around which the ancient world could wrap 
          its wracked form. Constantine realized that in the vast, unorganized 
          Christianity within his realm lay the essential principle of unity 
          needed by his empire, and which later became the dominating concept in 
          the Middle Ages. Rome is thus seen to be the meeting point of all 
          history, the papal succession filling the space from Caesar, and 
          Constantine, and Justinian, and binding all ages into one.[40] And 
          similarly the final events of prophecy cluster decisively around her.</font></p>

  <p>This statue of Pope Pius VI sits beneath the high altar of St. Peter's in 
  front of the entrance to Peter's alleged tomb, and is visible to the Pope when 
  he conducts Mass, a constant reminder of the deadly wound Napoleon inflicted 
  in 1798.</p>
  <p>But the deadly wound to papal influence during the reign of Pius VI was <em>
  not to be a fatal wound:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; <strong>
    and his deadly wound was healed:</strong> and all the world wondered after 
    the beast.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The papacy would not become extinct as a result of Napoleon's action in 
  1798, scripture predicted it would regain global influence. Its temporal power 
  would be restored, so much so that all the world would wonder at the papacy's 
  amazing revival.</p>
