<hr />
<p class="auto-style1">“To us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and 
reprehensible,” she continued. “It appears to have a deeply cynical purpose — to 
denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage.” — Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton. </p>
<p class="auto-style2">This overt expression of empathy for the rioters 
strengthens there cause, it is fanning the flames.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">The Libyan ambassador to the U.S. called the movie's 
producer "a terrorist like anyone else."</p>
<p class="auto-style1">The U.S. Embassy in Cairo issued a
statement 
saying that it “condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt 
the religious feelings of Muslims—as we condemn efforts to offend believers of 
all religions.” The statement added: “We firmly reject the actions by those who 
abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of 
others.” </p>
<p class="auto-style1">The White House asked Google to review the video, 
obviously attempting to pressure them into removing it. They repeatedly blamed 
the video, the rioting was a “response not to United States policy, and not 
obviously the administration or the American people,” but were “in response to a 
video, a film we have judged to be reprehensible and disgusting.” </p>
<p class="auto-style2">So censorship of free speech is the U. S. government 
solution to the problem. Let's investigate and prosecute the offending film 
maker, and throw him in jail as a hate monger, a reprehensible denigrator of a 
"great religion." </p>
<p class="auto-style1">Pope Benedict XVI, former head of what was called 
previously the office of the Inquisition, is quoted as saying: "Religious 
fundamentalism seeks to take power for political ends, at times using violence, 
over the individual conscience and over religion," the Pope said.&nbsp; "All 
religious leaders in the Middle East endeavor, by their example and their 
teaching, to do everything possible to uproot this threat, which 
indiscriminately and fatally affects believers." &mdash;

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: </span>"Freedoms of expression should be and must be guaranteed 
and protected, when they are used for common justice, common purpose," Ban told 
a news conference. "When some people use this freedom of expression to provoke 
or humiliate some others' values and beliefs, then this cannot be protected in 
such a way." "My position is that freedom of expression, while it is a 
fundamental right and privilege, should not be abused by such people, by such a 
disgraceful and shameful act," he said. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
The constitutional right of free speech in the United States has every 
appearance of being in serious jeopardy, even from high officials in the U.S. 
government. Incredibly, the U.S. Government even paid Pakistani TV to broadcast
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=6akGlF6g-Zw">
this pathetically lame clip</a> in which President Obama "rejects all efforts to 
denigrate the religious beliefs of others" and Hillary Clinton states "America's 
commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our 
nation." That is nauseating. <strong>Shame on them. It is 
entirely irrelevant what Obama or Clinton think about the 
movie in question, in the United States it is lawfully and constitutionally protected by freedom of speech. 
WE DO NOT TOLERATE THE RELIGION OF OTHERS, WE GUARANTEE THEIR RIGHT TO BELIEVE 
AND PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION WITHOUT GOVERNMENTAL INTERFERENCE. </strong></p>
<p class="auto-style6">
"The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. Yet to be 
credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see when 
the image of Jesus Christ is desecrated, churches are destroyed, or the 
Holocaust is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims, and Shiite 
pilgrims." — Obama's speech Sept 25, 2012 to the U.N. </p>
<p class="auto-style5">
<strong>It is not the right or responsibility of the U. S. civil government to 
enforce the blasphemy laws of any religion. </strong></p>
<p class="auto-style5">
The U.S. was founded largely by religious dissenters who 
sought freedom of religion and freedom of speech, fleeing the persecutions of 
the Roman Catholic Church. These Protestants broke away from what they knew to 
be an apostate, corrupt state church, the biblically prophesied harlot church 
ruled by the antichrist papal dynasty. Protestantism was not attempting to be 
hurtful regarding Catholics in preaching and teaching the errors and corruptions 
of Catholicism, it was simply stating what it knew to be the truths of the Bible. The Protestant's free speech right 
was and is not subject 
to the potential "hurt feelings" of the Catholic, no matter how humiliated&nbsp;or offended the Catholic might be. The Protestant had a protected right to 
believe, preach, and print whatever he wanted regarding Catholicism.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style4">Today however, there is a disturbing trend developing 
that 
</span> 
<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/this-isnt-allowed-even-on-bourbon-street/">
<span class="auto-style4">freedom of speech has a boundary</span></a><span class="auto-style4">, a line, that is drawn and determined by 
whoever is offended by what is said, that the limits of free speech are somehow 
exceeded whenever someone does not like it, or finds it denigrating or hateful, 
and that when that line is crossed, it should be subject to criminal prosecution 
as "hate speech." In
</span>
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/05/02/us-pope-terrorism-idUSL0211344020070502">
<span class="auto-style4">May of 2007</span></a><span class="auto-style4">, the Vatican's</span><em><span class="auto-style4"> L'Osservatore Romano</span></em><span class="auto-style4"> accused an Italian 
comedian of terrorism simply because he had criticized the Pope and Catholicism 
publicly. That response is what appears to be developing in the U.S., and should 
that happen, freedom of religion and freedom of speech will be history, a thing 
of the past, the constitution will be a worthless piece of paper.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;<strong><span class="auto-style4">We should be defending our freedom of 
speech and religion, not appeasing lawless mobs bent on violence murder and 
intimidation. </span> </strong></p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
