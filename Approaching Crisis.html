<blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><i><font size="5">The Approaching Crisis </font></i></b>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
  <span style="font-variant: small-caps; text-transform: uppercase">great</span> 
  crisis awaits the people of God. Very soon our nation will attempt to enforce 
  upon all, the observance of the first day of the week as a sacred day. In 
  doing this, they will not scruple to compel men against the voice of their own 
  conscience to observe the day the nation declares to be the Sabbath. In view 
  of this, there must be, among God’s commandment-keeping people, more 
  spirituality and a deeper consecration to God, and a zeal in his work that has 
  never yet been reached, to hold aloft the banner of God’s truth. The law of 
  God, the only standard of righteousness, must be prized in proportion as the 
  professed Christian world manifest contempt for it. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law of God should be loved and 
  prized by God’s true people now, more than ever before. There is the most 
  urgent necessity of enforcing the words of Christ upon the mind and heart of 
  every believer, both men and women, youth and children: “Search the 
  Scriptures.” Examine your Bibles as you have never done before. Unless you 
  arise to a higher, holier attitude in your religious life, you will not be 
  ready for the appearing of our Lord. There are many who are not purifying 
  their souls by obeying the truth. As great light has been given them, God 
  expects proportionate zeal, devotion, and faithfulness upon the part of his 
  people. But there will be proportionate darkness, unbelief, and blindness as 
  the truth is not appreciated and acted upon. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord will not remove from his people 
  every occasion to doubt; but he will give sufficient light and evidence to 
  encourage faith and confidence; and if they walk as Christ, the light of the 
  world, leads the way, they will not step aside into the paths of doubt and 
  unbelief. When declension and danger threaten the church, there will be more 
  praying, more fasting, by the faithful few, and the Lord will answer the 
  prayers offered to him in sincerity, and at the same time he will come forth 
  as an avenger because of the guiltiness of the evil-workers. He will be a 
  protector; for he will “avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto 
  him, though he bear long with them.” </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will appear as though Satan is 
  triumphant, and that truth is overborne with falsehood and error; because the 
  people over whom God has spread his shield, and the country which has been an 
  asylum to the conscience-oppressed lovers of God and the defenders of his 
  truth, are placed in desperate jeopardy through its oppressive legislation. 
  Should our nation abjure the principles of Protestantism, to give countenance 
  and sanction to the Sunday law, they will in this act join hands with popery; 
  for it will be nothing else than giving life to the tyranny which has been 
  eagerly waiting and watching its opportunity to spring into active despotism. 
  And now, as this evil is on the point of realization, it is the business of 
  all believers in the Bible to arouse. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years many have sat in calm 
  expectation of this event, and they will not be working out the purposes of 
  God if they comfort themselves with the thought that what is to come will 
  come, and anything that they may do will not prevent it. They should not 
  settle down in an easy, comfortable indolence, thinking that God will shelter 
  his own people in the day of this calamity. This is the time for action, not 
  for indolence and spiritual stupor. Satan is preparing his forces with a power 
  from beneath, and all heaven is in busy activity, ready to work in the 
  interests of those who are awake to the condition of things, and, like 
  faithful sentinels, are doing all they can to arouse the people to avert, if 
  possible, the threatened evil. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our people continue in the listless 
  attitude in which they have been, God cannot pour upon them his Spirit. They 
  are unprepared to co-operate with him. They do not realize the threatened 
  danger, and are not awake to the situation. They should feel now as never 
  before their need of vigilance and well-concerted action. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following quotation from “Testimony, 
  No. 32,” pages 208-210, which was published in 1885, shows that our people 
  have not been left without warnings as to the duties and dangers of the times:
  </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has revealed what is to take place 
  in the last days, that his people may be prepared to stand against the tempest 
  of opposition and wrath. Those who have been warned of the events before them 
  are not sit in calm expectation of the coming storm, comforting themselves 
  that the Lord will shelter his faithful ones in the day of trouble. We are to 
  be as men waiting for their Lord, not in idle expectancy, but in earnest work, 
  with unwavering faith. It is no time now to allow our minds to be engrossed 
  with things of minor importance. While men are sleeping, Satan is actively 
  arranging matters so that the Lord’s people may not have mercy or justice. The 
  Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing 
  the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see 
  whither the under-current is tending. Its professions are mild, and apparently 
  Christian; but when it shall speak, it will reveal the spirit of the dragon. 
  It is our duty to do all in our power to avert the threatened danger. We 
  should endeavor to disarm prejudice by placing ourselves in a proper light 
  before the people. We should bring before them the real question at issue, 
  thus interposing the most effectual protest against measures to restrict 
  liberty of conscience. We should search the Scriptures, and be able to give 
  the reason for our faith. Says the prophet, “The wicked shall do wickedly, and 
  none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.” </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have access to God through 
  Christ have important work before them. Now is the time to lay hold of the arm 
  of our strength. The prayer of David should be the prayer of pastors and 
  laymen: “It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy law.” 
  Let the servants of the Lord weep between the porch and the altar, crying, 
  “Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach.” God has 
  always wrought for his people in their greatest extremity, when there seemed 
  the least hope that ruin could be averted. The designs of wicked men, the 
  enemies of the church, are subject to his power and overruling providence. He 
  can move upon the hearts of statesmen; the wrath of the turbulent and 
  disaffected, the haters of God, of his truth and his people, can be turned 
  aside, even as the rivers of water are turned, if he orders it thus. Prayer 
  moves the arm of Omnipotence. He who marshals the stars in order in the 
  heavens, whose word controls the waves of the great deep,—the same infinite 
  Creator will work in behalf of his people if they call upon him in faith. He 
  will restrain the forces of darkness, until the warning is given to the world, 
  and all who will heed it are prepared for the conflict. “The wrath of man 
  shall praise Thee,” says the psalmist; “the remainder of wrath shalt Thou 
  restrain.” God means that testing truth shall be brought to the front, and 
  become a subject of examination and discussion, even if it is through the 
  contempt placed upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated. Every 
  controversy, every reproach, every slander, will be God’s means of provoking 
  inquiry, and awakening minds that otherwise would slumber. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it has been in the past history of 
  God’s people. For refusing to worship the great golden image which 
  Nebuchadnezzar had set up, the three Hebrews were cast into the fiery furnace. 
  But God preserved his servants in the midst of the flames, and the attempt to 
  enforce idolatry resulted in bringing the knowledge of the true God before the 
  assembled princes and great men of the vast kingdom of Babylon. So it was when 
  the decree went forth forbidding prayer to any god save the king. As Daniel, 
  according to his custom, made his supplications three times a day to the God 
  of heaven, the attention of the princes and rulers was called to his case. He 
  had an opportunity to speak for himself, to show who is the true God, and to 
  present the reason why he alone should receive worship, and the duty of 
  rendering him praise and homage. And the deliverance of Daniel from the den of 
  lions was another evidence that the Being whom he worshiped was the true and 
  living God. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the imprisonment of Paul brought the 
  gospel before kings, princes, and rulers, who otherwise would not have had 
  this light. The efforts made to retard the progress of truth will serve to 
  extend it. The excellence of truth is more clearly seen from every successive 
  point from which it may be viewed. Error requires disguise and concealment. It 
  clothes itself in angel robes, and every manifestation of its real character 
  lessens its chance of success. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people whom God has made the 
  depositaries of his law are not to permit their light to be hidden. The truth 
  must be proclaimed in the dark places of the earth. Obstacles must be met and 
  surmounted. A great work is to be done, and this work has been intrusted to 
  those who know the truth. They should make mighty intercession with God for 
  help now. The love of Christ must be diffused in their own hearts. The Spirit 
  of Christ must be poured out upon them, and they must be making ready to stand 
  in the judgment. While they are consecrating themselves to God, a convincing 
  power will attend their efforts to present the truth to others, and its light 
  will find access to many hearts. We must sleep no longer on Satan’s enchanted 
  ground, but call into requisition all our resources, and avail ourselves of 
  every facility with which Providence has furnished us. The last warning is to 
  be proclaimed “before many people, and nations, and tongues, and kings;” and 
  the promise is given, “Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the 
  world.” </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through fraud and falsehood Satan is now 
  using those who claim to be Christians to divorce the world from God’s mercy. 
  They are working in blindness. They do not see that if a Protestant government 
  sacrifices the principles that have made them a free, independent nation, and 
  through legislation brings into the Constitution, principles that will 
  propagate papal falsehood and papal delusion, they are plunging into the Roman 
  horrors of the Dark Ages. But this need not be, just at this point of time, if 
  the church is aroused to her duty and her work. A vast responsibility is 
  devolving upon men and women of prayer throughout the land, to petition that 
  God may sweep back this cloud of evil, and give a few more years of grace to 
  work for the Master. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peculiar work of the third angel has 
  not been seen in its importance. God meant that his people should be far in 
  advance of what they are today. But now, when the time has come for them to 
  spring into action, they have the getting ready to do. When Satan made his 
  advances, it was high time for the watchmen on the walls of Zion to arouse and 
  counteract his efforts to obtain the advantage. It is not in the order of God 
  that light has been kept from our people,—the very present truth which they 
  needed for this time. Not all of our ministers who are giving the third 
  angel’s message, really understand what constitutes that message. The National 
  Reform movement has been regarded by some as of so little importance that they 
  have not thought it necessary to give much attention to it, and have even felt 
  that in so doing, they would be giving time to questions distinct from the 
  third angel’s message. May the Lord forgive our brethren for thus interpreting 
  the very message for this time. The third angel’s message comprehends more 
  than many suppose. What interpretation do they give to the passage which says 
  an angel descended from heaven, and the earth was lightened with his glory? 
  This is not a time when we can be excused for inactivity. If this work, which 
  was so essential, had been taken up by our ministers, there would be today a 
  far different state of things in all our churches. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some in the church will prove to be 
  false brethren; their faith, their love, their patience, their constancy will 
  be tested and tried; and if they are not rooted and grounded in the truth, if 
  they are not filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ 
  unto the glory and the praise of God, they will become offended at reproofs 
  and warnings, will not humble their souls before God, and will go back and 
  walk no more with those who love the truth. The people need to be aroused in 
  regard to the dangers of the present time. The watchmen are asleep. We are 
  years behind. Let the chief watchmen feel the urgent necessity of taking heed 
  to themselves, lest they lose the opportunities given to them to see the 
  dangers. Let them blow the trumpet, not in a general way, but so that it may 
  give a certain sound, that other watchmen upon the walls of Zion may hear, and 
  in their turn send forth the warning note. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perils now threaten the people of God; 
  and what will they do? Can we not assist in lifting the standard, and in 
  calling to the front those who have a regard for their religious rights and 
  privileges? God calls us to awake; for the end is near. The prophecies that 
  show us the closing scenes of earth’s history, are fast fulfilling. The time 
  is fast approaching when we shall be made to feel the hand of oppression, 
  because we demand our religious rights. Shall we then dishonor God by keeping 
  silent, when his holy commandments are being trampled under foot? </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been looking many years for a 
  Sunday law to be enacted in our land; and now that the movement is right upon 
  us, we ask, What are our people going to do in the matter? Do you realize that 
  the night will soon come, when no man can work? Have you that intensity of 
  zeal, that piety and devotion, which will enable you to stand when opposition 
  is brought upon you? If God has ever spoken by me, the time will come when we 
  shall be brought before councils, and every position of truth which we hold 
  will be severely criticised. The time that we are now allowing to go to waste 
  should be devoted to the charge God has given us, of preparing for the 
  approaching crisis. Much time should be spent in prayer, that our garments of 
  character may be washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should especially seek God for grace 
  and power to be given his people now. God lives; and we do not believe that 
  the time has fully come when he would have our liberties restricted. The 
  prophet saw “four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding 
  the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor 
  on the sea, nor on any tree.” Another angel ascending from the east, cried to 
  them, saying, “Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we 
  have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” This points out the 
  work we now have to do, which is to cry to God for the angels to hold the four 
  winds until missionaries shall be sent to all parts of the world, and shall 
  have proclaimed the warning against disobeying the law of Jehovah. But every 
  conceivable thing that the enemy can bring against the people of God, to 
  hinder them in their work, will be employed. The Lord, on the other hand, bids 
  all to be awake and to watch; for it was while men slept, that the enemy sowed 
  tares. </p>
