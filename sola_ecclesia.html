      <p align="left"><b>Rome The Only Infallible Interpreter of Scripture:</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">10. ... God Himself has set up a living authority to 
      establish and teach the true and legitimate meaning of His heavenly 
      revelation. This authority judges infallibly all disputes which concern 
      matters of faith and morals, lest the faithful be swirled around by every 
      wind of doctrine which springs from the evilness of men in encompassing 
      error. And this living infallible authority is active only in that Church 
      which was built by Christ the Lord upon Peter, the head of the entire 
      Church, leader and shepherd, whose faith He promised would never fail. 
      This Church has had an unbroken line of succession from Peter himself; 
      these legitimate pontiffs are the heirs and defenders of the same 
      teaching, rank, office and power. And the Church is where Peter is,[5] and 
      Peter speaks in the Roman Pontiff,[6] living at all times in his 
      successors and making judgment,[7] providing the truth of the faith to 
      those who seek it.[8] The divine words therefore mean what this Roman See 
      of the most blessed Peter holds and has held.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditions, it will be seen, 
    are placed before the Bible in this [Roman Catholic] epitome of faith. 
    Indeed, the Word of God, as a rule of belief and conduct is, in effect, done 
    away; and the interpretations of the church are put in its place. So that in 
    every case, the inquiry of the faithful Romanist must be — not what saith 
    the scripture — but, <i>what saith &quot;Mother Church?</i>&quot; Not to follow the 
    church, however opposed she may be to the Bible, would be a violation of his 
    oath.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The celebrated Council of Trent, which was called by a Bull of Pope 
    Paul III, in the year 1542, decreed that the Roman Catholic church received 
    and venerated with equal affection of piety and reverence, the Bible and 
    traditions. &quot;<i>Omnes libros tam veteris quam novi Testamenti, — nec non 
    Traditiones — pari pietatis affectuac reverentia suscipit, et veneratur.</i>&quot; 
    When, however, tradition was not in accordance with the Word of God, it 
    would be manifestly impossible to conform to this decree, unless a man could 
    conscientiously receive and reverence a truth and its opposite error at the 
    same time. And therefore, to relieve the conscience of the Romanist, it was 
    necessary that the right of interpreting the Bible should be given 
    exclusively to Mother Church, who is also the keeper of Tradition. Hence the 
    Papist has, in fact and strictly speaking, only one standard of faith, and 
    that is neither the Bible nor Tradition, but the Church. He professes, 
    indeed, to acknowledge both the scripture and tradition; but he is really 
    bound to receive and obey whatever Mother Church declares to be the truth as 
    contained in the Bible and Tradition. She must decide for him in every case, 
    and from her judgment there can be no appeal. ...</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Tradition</i> is one of the 
    most essential subjects of dispute between Protestants and Romanists. The 
    Romanists declare that the Scriptures alone are not sufficient for 
    Salvation; but that there is the word of God, by <i>hearsay</i>, which is 
    superior to the word of God in <i>writing</i>. By this <i>hearsay</i>, for 
    tradition is nothing else, they assure the world that the Scripture must be 
    explained; so that if the Scripture says <i>white</i>, and tradition says <i>
    black</i>, a Roman Catholic is bound to say, that <i>white</i> means <i>
    black</i> in God's written word.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24.</b> And why do we 
    say that through the Catholic Church alone we infallibly know the true 
    meaning of the Scriptures and of tradition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the Catholic Church alone is <i>'the pillar and 
    ground of the truth'</i> (1 Tim. iii. 15), and, therefore, cannot err in the 
    interpretation of the Word of God.<br>
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25.</b> May no one, then, presume to explain the 
    Scripture and Tradition contrary to the interpretation of the Catholic 
    Church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No; for this would be as if ye understood the Scriptures and 
    Tradition better than the Holy Ghost, who inspires the Church with the true 
    meaning of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>26. </b>But is the meaning of the Holy Scriptures not 
    clear in itself, and easy to be understood by every one?</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">[pg. 76]</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp; No; for the Holy Scripture is a 
    Divine and mysterious book, <i>'in which,' </i>as St. Peter says, speaking 
    of the Epistles of St. Paul, '<i>are certain things hard to be understood, 
    which the unlearned and unstable wrest to their own destruction</i>' (2 
    Peter iii. 16).</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">'What else gives rise to so many 
    heresies, save that the Scripture, which is good in itself, is ill 
    understood?' (St. Augustine).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27.</b> It is not, 
    then, true that the Bible alone is the only Rule of Faith? Or, in other 
    words; Is not every private individual to search the Bible, and nothing but 
    the Bible, until he finds out what he has to believe?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No; for not the Bible alone, but the Bible and Tradition, <i>
    both </i>infallibly interpreted by the Church, are the right Rule of Faith. 
    ...<br>
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28.</b> What has the Church decreed with regard to the 
    reading of the Bible in the vulgar tongue?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. That we should have the learning and piety requisite for 
    it; and 2. That the translation should be accompanied with explanations, and 
    that both should be approved by the Church.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><font size="2">By

    pastors to whom Christ said, &quot;Go <i>teach</i> all nations.&quot; This teaching 
    body, when taken collectively with the chief Pastor at their head, all 
    Catholics believe to be infallible, — that is, they cannot teach any error 
    against the faith or morals. Now, if this great fundamental truth be clearly 
    laid down in Scripture, then Catholics will be quite safe in following the 
    teaching of their pastors; then the <i>teaching</i> body will be, to the <i>
    taught</i>, an infallible rule of faith. Mark well, we do not maintain that 
    the pastors of the Church are, of themselves, infallible, but that God has

    successors in its full purity (Jn. 21:25; 2 Tm. 1:13-14; 2:2; 2 Thes. 2:15),
