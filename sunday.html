  <p>The reason for this, is I am going to assume you now know that Sunday has 
  no biblical foundation for its being kept as a replacement for the Saturday 
  Sabbath, that it is a day commanded only by Roman Catholic Tradition. So, if 
  you are unsure of this, then please read the preceding articles.</p>

  <p>Since the Bible from Genesis to Revelation recognizes only the Saturday 
  Sabbath as the weekly day of rest, then how did the practice of Sunday worship 
  come about? What is its origin? No doubt Christians felt Sunday should be 
  observed to commemorate the resurrection, but where in the Bible do Jesus or 
  the disciples make such a statement? Who sanctioned the <em>replacement</em> 
  of the Sabbath with Sunday or claims to have done so? Many books have been 
  written on this subject, and I can only hope to scratch the surface here in 
  this short article, but I hope it will prompt the reader to do further 
  research on this topic. Here are just a few extracts -</p>
  <p><b>Emperor Aurelian begins new Sun cult. (274 A.D.)</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[p. 55] In 274, Aurelian … created a new cult of the “Invincible Sun.” 
    Worshipped in a splendid temple, served by pontiffs who were raised to the 
    level of the ancient pontiffs of Rome, celebrated every fourth year by 
    magnificent games, Sol Invictus was definitely promoted to the highest rank 
    in the divine hierarchy and became the official protector of the Sovereigns 
    and of the Empire… He [Aurelian] placed in his new sanctuary the images of 
    Bel and Helios, which he captured at Palmyra. In establishing this new State 
    cult, Aurelian in reality proclaimed the dethronement of the old Roman 
    idolatry and the accession of Semitic Sun-worship…<br>
    [p. 56] This sidereal theology, founded on ancient beliefs of Chaldean 
    astrologers, transformed in the Hellenistic age under the twofold influence 
    of astronomic discoveries and Stoic thought, [was] promoted, after becoming 
    a pantheistic Sun-worship, to the rank of official religion of the Roman 
    Empire.</p>

    in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country, however, 
    persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their

    <p>[p. 122] This legislation by Constantine probably bore no relation to

    of Pontifex Maximus, was only adding the day of the Sun, the worship of 
    which was then firmly [p. 123] established in the Roman Empire, to the other 
    ferial days of the sacred calendar…<br>
    [p. 270] What began, however, as a pagan ordinance, ended as a Christian 
    regulation; and a long series of imperial decrees, during the fourth, fifth, 
    and sixth centuries, enjoined with increasing stringency abstinence from 
    labour on Sunday.</p>

        Rabanus Maurus</a> (776-856), abbot of Fulda and later archbishop of 
        Mainz, Germany, was rated one of the greatest theologians of his age and 
        probably the most cultured man of his time, and exceptionally learned in 
        patristics. Besides, he was a zealous defender of the papacy and its 
        teachings. In one of his works, he says,
        <blockquote>
          <p>Pope Sylvester instructed the clergy to keep the <i>feriae</i>. 
          And, indeed, from an old custom he called the first day [of the week] 
          the &quot;Lord's [day],&quot; on which the light was made in the beginning and 
          also the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.<sup>6</sup></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Rabanus Maurus does not mean to say that Sylvester was the first man 
        who referred to the days of the week as <i>feriae</i> or who first 
        started the observance of Sunday among Christians. He means that, 
        according to the testimony of Roman Catholic writers, Sylvester 
        confirmed those practices and made them official insofar as his church 
        was concerned. Hence Rabanus says elsewhere in his writings:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Pope Sylvester first among the Romans ordered that the names of the 
          days [of the week], which they previously called after the name of 
          their gods, that is, [the day] of the Sun, [the day] of the Moon, [the 
          day] of Mars, [the day] of Mercury, [the day] of Jupiter, [the day] of 
          Venus, [the day] of Saturn, they should call <i>feriae</i> thereafter, 
          that is the first <i>feria, </i>the second <i>feria, </i>the third <i>
          feria, </i>the fourth <i>feria, </i>the fifth <i>feria, </i>the sixth
          <i>feria,</i> because that in the beginning of Genesis it is written 
          that God said concerning each day: on the first, &quot;Let there be light:; 
          on the second, &quot;Let there be a firmament&quot;; on the third, &quot;Let the 
          earth bring forth verdure&quot;; etc. But he [Sylvester] ordered [them] to 
          call the Sabbath by the ancient term of the law, [to call] the first
          <i>feria</i> the &quot;Lord's day,&quot; because on it the Lord rose [from the 
          dead], Moreover, the same pope decreed that the rest of the Sabbath 
          should be transferred rather to the Lord's day [Sunday], in order that 
          on that day we should rest from worldly works for the praise of God.<sup>7</sup></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note particularly, he says that &quot;the same pope [Sylvester I] decreed 
        that the rest of the Sabbath should be transferred rather to the Lord's 
        day [Sunday].&quot;<sup>8</sup> According to this statement, he was the first 
        bishop to introduce the idea that the divinely appointed rest of the 
        Sabbath day should be transferred to the first day of the week. This is 
        significant, especially in view of the fact that it was during 
        Sylvester's pontificate that the emperor of Rome [Constantine] issued 
        the first civil laws compelling men to rest from secular labor on 
        Sunday, and that Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea, was the first theologian 
        on record to present arguments, allegedly from the Scriptures, that 
        Christ did transfer the rest of the Sabbath day to Sunday.</p>

  <p><b>Easter, Sunday and Paganism.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 808]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Now, the church uses three names to designate the Easter day and season; one 
    an English name, one a Latin name, and one a Hebrew name<font face="Times New Roman">—</font><em>Easter, 
    Resurrectio, Phase</em>. Some have never thought it worth while to inquire 
    why this season is called Easter-tide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just add the letter &quot;N&quot; to the word, make it &quot;Eastern,&quot; and we have the 
    solution. Some, indeed, derive from &quot;Eastra&quot; the Goddess of Dawn; this 
    season being dedicated to that goddess in pagan, Anglo-Saxon days. But these 
    have only pursued the inquiry half way. Why was 
    the Goddess of Dawn called Eastra? Because the dawn of day is in the East<font face="Times New Roman">—</font><em>Morgenland</em><font face="Times New Roman">—</font>as 
    the musical, mystical Germans call it<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>morningland.</p>
    <p>[pg.809]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The church took the pagan philosophy and made it the buckler of faith 
    against the heathen. She took the pagan, Roman Pantheon, temple of all the 
    gods, and made it sacred to all the martyrs; so it stands to this day. She 
    took the pagan Sunday and made it the Christian Sunday. She took the pagan 
    Easter and made it the feast we celebrate during this season.<br>
    <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday</em> and <em>Easter</em> day are, if we consider their 
    derivation, much the same. In truth, all Sundays are Sundays only because 
    they are a weekly, partial recurrence of Easter day. The pagan Sunday was, 
    in a manner, an unconscious preparation for Easter day. The Sun was a 
    foremost god with heathendom. Balder the beautiful, the White God, the old 
    Scandinavians called him. The sun has worshippers at this hour in Persia and 
    other lands. &quot;Some of you,&quot; says Carlyle, &quot;may remember that fancy of 
    Plato's. A man is kept in some dark, underground cave from childhood till 
    maturity; then suddenly is carried to the upper airs. For the first time he 
    sees the sun shining in its splendor overhead. He must fall down, says 
    Plato, and adore it.&quot; There is, in truth, something royal, kingly about the 
    sun, making it a fit emblem of Jesus, the Sun of Justice. Hence the church 
    in these countries would seem to have said, &quot;Keep that old pagan name. It 
    shall remain consecrated, sanctified.&quot; And thus the pagan Sunday, dedicated 
    to Balder, became the Christian Sunday, sacred to Jesus. The sun is a 
    fitting emblem of Jesus. The Fathers often compared Jesus to the sun; as 
    they compared Mary to the moon, the beautiful moon, the beautiful Mary, 
    shedding her mild, beneficent light on the darkness and the night of this 
    world<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>not light of her own; no Catholic says this; but<font face="Times New Roman">—</font>light reflected 
    from the sun, Jesus.</p>

  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="1">
  <p>If as many suppose, Christians as a whole observed Sunday in place of the 
  &quot;Jewish&quot; Sabbath from resurrection Sunday forward, then why was it necessary 
  for the church to enact ecclesiastical laws to enforce Sunday worship as a day 
  of rest? Simply put, the issue to the Catholic Church has always been one of 
  authority, authority to declare binding holy festival days. It is a <em>mark</em> 
  of their authority to institute such days, even appropriating previously pagan 
  days and declaring them obligatory, and that one commits a sin if you do not 
  attend services on those days. The Bible is quite silent on Sunday sacredness, 
  so the &quot;Bible Only&quot; Protestants contradict themselves by observing it as a 
  replacement for the Sabbath.</p>

    holy faith, so as to forbid any work being done on the Sabbath day. What 
    else can I call these but preachers of Antichrist, who, when he comes, will 
    cause the Sabbath day as well as the Lord’s day to be kept free from all 
    work. For, because he pretends to die and rise again, he wishes the Lord’s 
    day to be had in reverence; and, because he compels the people to judaize 
    that he may bring back the outward rite of the law, and subject the perfidy 
    of the Jews to himself, he wishes the Sabbath to be observed.</p>

    Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no Scriptural 
    authority.</p>

  <p><b>Catholics on changing the Sabbath Commandment-</b><br>
  (third by their reckoning) -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <em>
    <p align="center">The Third Commandment Expounded.</em></p>
    <p>Q. What is the third commandment?<br>
    A. Remember that thou keepest holy the sabbath day.</p>
    <p>Q. When did the Sabbath begin to be kept?<br>
    A. From the very creation of the world; for then God blessed the seventh 
    day, and rested on it from all His work.—Gen. ii. 2.</p>
    <p>Q. When was this commandment renewed?<br>
    A. In the Old Law, when God gave the commandments to Moses on mount <em>
    Sinai</em>, written with his own finger in two tables of stone.—<em>Exod</em>. 
    xx. 1, &amp;c. xxxi.</p>
    <p>Q. Why was the <em>Jewish</em> Sabbath changed into the <em>Sunday?</em><br>
    A. Because Christ was born upon a <em>Sunday</em>, arose from the dead upon 
    a <em>Sunday</em>, and sent down the Holy Ghost on a <em>Sunday</em>—works 
    not inferior to the creation of the world.</p>
    <p>Q. By whom was it changed?<br>
    A. By the Governors of the Church, the Apostles, who also kept it; for St. 
    John was in spirit on the Lord’s day (which was Sunday)—<em>Apoc</em>. i. 
    10.<br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Catholics themselves have maintained that scriptural evidence for the 
  Lord's day being Sunday is non-existent. See

  <a href="firstday.html">Did the Apostles Keep Sunday?</a></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q. How prove you that the Church hath power to command feasts and 
    holydays?<br>
    A. By the very act of changing the Sabbath into <em>Sunday</em>, which 
    Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves, by 
    keeping <em>Sunday</em> strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded 
    by the same Church.</p>
    <p>Q. How do you prove that?<br>
    A. Because by keeping <em>Sunday,</em> they acknowledge the Church's power 
    to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not keeping the rest 
    by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same power.</p>

  <p>So in 600 years the Sabbath which was kept by Jesus and His disciples and, 
  based on scripture, never nullified by Sunday observance, was gradually 
  eclipsed by both civil and ecclesiastical laws. Yet even Pope Gregory I, by 
  his very condemnation of Sabbath keepers as antichrist, is offering proof that 
  Sabbath observance stubbornly endured. Sabbath keepers look to the word of God 
  for their instruction, and not to the laws and decrees of men. A time is soon 
  approaching when Sunday laws will again be enacted, and the apostate church 
  will again try to assert it's presumed authority to enforce holy days by 
  legislation. Those who know the truth from the word of God will not be moved 
  off of the Seventh-day Saturday Sabbath day then either, and God will bless 
  them for it:</p>
