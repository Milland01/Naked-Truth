      Explanation of certain ceremonies of the Church, which now renders it more 
      complete for instructing the ignorant, in the whole doctrine and 
      discipline of the Catholic Church. Besides I have corrected some false 
      citations, and other errata, which by the printer's negligence, occurred

      <p align="center"><i>What a Christian is: And of the Blessed Trinity.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quest. <font size="+2">C</font>HILD, what religion 
      are you of?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ans. Sir, by the benefit and grace of God, I am Christian.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Whom understand you by a Christian?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Him that inwardly believes and outwardly professes the law 
      of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When are we obliged to make an external profession of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. As often as God's honour, our own, or neighbour's good 
      requires it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that we are bound outwardly to profess our 
      faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of St. <i>Matt.</i> x. 32, where Christ saith, Every 
      one, therefore, that shall confess me before men, I will confess him 
      before my Father who is in heaven. But he that shall deny me before men, I 
      also will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are we bound also to venture the ruin of our estates, the 
      loss of our friends, and to lay down our very lives for the profession and 
      defence of our faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Doubtless we are: seeing the reward we expect in heaven, 
      infinitely exceeds all the pleasures and punishments of this life. And 
      because Christ the Son of the living God, has suffered far greater things 
      for us, even to a disgraceful death on the cross? and therefore, it were 
      base ingratitude in us, not to be ready to give our lives for him as often 
      as his honour shall require it. <i>Luke</i>, xiv. 26, 33.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what doth the faith and law of Christ chiefly consist?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;[pg. 6]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In two principle mysteries, namely, the unity and 
      trinity of God, and the incarnation and death of our Saviour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the unity and trinity of God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means, that in God there is but one only divine nature 
      or essence, and that in the same one and divine nature there are three 
      persons, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How show you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of John, v. 7. There are three that give testimony in 
      heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are there but three Persons only?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the Father had no beginning, nor proceeds from any 
      other person; the Son proceeds from the Father, and Holy Ghost proceeds 
      from the Father and the Son.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the incarnation and death of our Saviour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that the second person of the blessed Trinity was 
      made man, and died on the cross to save us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what are these two mysteries signified?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the sign of the cross, as it is made by Catholics, for 
      when we put our right hand to our head, saying, In the name we signify 
      Unity; and when we make the sign of the cross saying, Of the Father, and 
      of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, we signify Trinity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How doth the sign of the cross represent the incarnation 
      and death of our Saviour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By putting us in mind that he was made man and died upon 
      the cross for us.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Faith Explained</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a gift of God or a supernatural quality, in-</p>
      <p>&nbsp;[pg. 7]</p>
      <p>fused by God into the soul, by which we firmly believe all those things 
      which he hath any way revealed to us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is faith necessary to salvation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is; St. Paul assuring that without faith it is 
      impossible to please God. <i>Heb.</i> xi. 6. and <i>St. Mark</i>, xvi. 16, 
      saying, He that believeth not shall be condemned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why must we firmly believe matters of faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God hath revealed them, who can neither deceive, 
      nor be deceived.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second reason is, because not only all points of faith, but 
      also the rule, or necessary and infallible means whereby to know them, to 
      wit, the church's oral and universal tradition, are absolutely certain, 
      and cannot lead us into error in faith; else we can never sufficiently be 
      assured what is faith, or what is not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. If a man should deny, or obstinately doubt of some one 
      point of faith, would he thereby lose his whole faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, he would; because true faith must always be entire, 
      and he that fails in one, is made guilty of all, by discrediting the 
      authority of God revealing it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it not enough to believe all that is written in the 
      Bible?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, it is not: For we must also believe all apostolic 
      tradition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>2 Thess</i>. ii. 15. Therefore brethren (saith 
      St. Paul) stand and hold ye the traditions which ye have learned, whether 
      by word, or by our Epistle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The apostle's Creed, which all are bound to believe, 
      although it be not in Scripture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is faith only, as excluding good works, sufficient to 
      salvation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No: it is not: <i>St. James</i>, ii. 24, saying, Do you 
      see how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only? And St. 
      Paul, saying, <i>1 Cor.</i> xiii. 2. If I should have all faith, so that I 
      could remove mountains, and not have charity, I am nothing. And if I 
      should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver 
      by body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
      <p>[pg. 8]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What faith will suffice to justify?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Faith working by charity in Jesus Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What vice is opposite to faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Heresy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is Heresy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Is it an obstinate error in things that are of faith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it a grievous sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A very grievous one, because it wholly divides a man from 
      God, and leads to atheism, Christ saying, if he will not hear the church 
      let him be to thee as an heathen and a publican, <i>Matt.</i> xviii. 17.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>The Creed Expounded</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the creed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the sum of belief.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who made it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The twelve apostles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. At what time did they make it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Before they divided themselves into the several countries 
      of the world to preach the gospel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end did they make it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That so they might be able to teach one and the same 
      doctrine in all places.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What doth the creed contain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All those chief things which we are bound to believe, 
      concerning God and his church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the first article of the creed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven 
      and earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies I believe?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies as much as I most firmly and undoubtedly 
      hold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, I believe in God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that not only that I firmly believe there is a 
      God, but also that I am piously affected to him, as to my chiefest good 
      and last end, with confidence in him, or otherwise that I move unto him by 
      faith, hope, and charity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the word Father?</p>
      <p>[pg. 9]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the first person of the most blessed 
      Trinity, who by nature is the Father of his own only begotten Son, the 
      second Person of the blessed Trinity; by adoption is the Father of all 
      good Christians; and by creations is the Father of all creatures.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the word Almighty?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that God is able to do all things as he pleaseth; 
      that he sees all things, knows all things, and governs all things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is he called Almighty in this place?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we might doubt of nothing which follows.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signify the words, Creator of heaven and earth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They signify that God made heaven and earth, and all 
      creatures in them, of nothing, by his sole word, <i>Gen.</i> i.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What moved God to make them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His own mere goodness, that so he might communicate 
      himself to angels, and to men, for whom he made all other creatures.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did God create the angels?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. On the first day when he created heaven and earth, <i>Gen.</i> 
      i. where Moses implies the creation of angels in the word heaven, and 
      makes no other mention of it. The Nicene creed, interpreting the Apostles' 
      Creed, says, that the words Creator of heaven and earth, mean all things 
      visible and invisible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end did God create them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To be partakers of his glory, and our guardians.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you by Scripture, that they be our guardians?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>St. Matt.</i> xviii. 10, where Christ saith 'See 
      that you despise not one of these little ones: For I say unto you, their 
      angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Do the angels know our necessities, and hear our prayers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Doubtless they do, since God has deputed them to be our 
      guardians; which is also proved out of <i>Zach.</i> i 12. where an angel 
      prays for two whole cities; the words are 'Then the angel of the Lord 
      answered and</p>
      <p>[pg. 10]</p>
      <p>said, O Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on the cities 
      of Juda and Jerusalem, against which thou hast been angry these seventy 
      years?'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What Scripture have you for praying to angels?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Gen.</i> xlviii. 16, where Jacob on his death bed 
      prayed to an angel for Ephraim and Manasses, saying, 'The angel of the 
      Lord that delivered me from all evils, bless these children.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This place is cited for prayer to the angels in the notes of 
      the Rhemish Testament upon it, and is confirmed to signify a created angel 
      by St. Basil, lib. 3. cont. Dunon. sub initio: And St. Chrysosthom. 7. in 
      laudem Sancti Pauli.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How did Lucifer and his fellow angels fall from their 
      dignity in heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By a rebellious sin of pride.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. With what shall their ruins be repaired?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Will holy men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When and to what likeness did God create man?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. On the sixth day, and to his own likeness: <i>Gen.</i> i. 
      27.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what doth the similitude consist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In this, that man is in his soul an incorporeal, 
      intellectual and immortal spirit, as God is. And in this, that as in God 
      there is but one most divine nature or essence, and yet three distinct 
      Persons; so in man there is but one indivisible soul, and yet in that soul 
      three distinct powers, will, memory, and understanding.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove the soul to be immortal?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt.</i> x. 28, where Christ saith, 'Fear not 
      them that kill the body, and cannot kill the soul.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Eccles.</i> xii. 7. At our death the dust 
      returns to the earth from whence it was, and the spirit to God that gave 
      it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what state did God create man?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the state of original justice, and perfection of all 
      natural gifts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Do we owe much to God for our creation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Very much, seeing he made us in such perfect state, 
      creating us for himself, and all things else for us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How did we lose original justice?</p>
      <p>[pg. 11]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By Adam's disobedience to God, in 
      eating the forbidden fruit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what state are we now born?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the state of original sin, and prone to actual sin, 
      subject to death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Rom.</i> v. 12. 'By one man sin entered into the 
      world, and by sin death; and so unto all men death did pass, in whom all 
      have sinned.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Had man ever died, if he had never sinned?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, he had not, but had been converted by the tree of 
      life, and been translated alive into the fellowship of the angels.</p>

&nbsp; <i>The Second Article</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">S</font>AY the second article.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Of what treats this article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Of the second person of the blessed Trinity, in whom we 
      also believe and put our trust.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the second Person?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He is true God, and true Man, in one Person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>St. John's</i> Gospel, chap. i. 1. 'In the 
      beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, 
      &amp;c. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Phil.</i> ii. 6, 7, where <i>St. Paul</i> saith, 
      'That Christ when he was in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be 
      equal with God, but he hath lessened himself, taking the form of a 
      servant, made unto the likeness of men; and found in habit as a man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why should God be made man?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To redeem and save lost man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Was his incarnation necessary for that end?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the manner it was; because our offences against God 
      were in some sort infinite; as being against his infinite goodness; and 
      therefore required an infinite satisfaction; which no one could make but 
      God and therefore he was made man.</p>
      <p>[pg. 12]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you for the necessity of 
      the Incarnation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God is in himself so spiritual, sublime, and 
      abstract a thing, that if he had not in his mercy adapted his own 
      inscrutable greatness to the littleness of our sensible capacity, by being 
      made man, scarce one of a thousand would ever have been able to know 
      anything to the purpose of him; or consequently to love and serve him as 
      they ought, (which is the necessary means of our salvation) since nothing 
      is efficaciously willed which is not first well understood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What benefit have we by the knowledge of God made man?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It much inflames us with the love of God, who could not 
      more have dignified men's nature, or shown more love to the world, then to 
      send down his only Son to redeem it in our flesh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the name of Jesus?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies a Saviour, St. <i>Matt.</i> i. 21.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is any special honour due to that name?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is, because it is the highest title of God made man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Phil.</i> ii. 8, 9, 10, where we read, 'God hath 
      given unto Christ because he hath humbled himself unto the death of the 
      cross, a name which is above all names, the name of Jesus.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because there is no other name under heaven given to man, 
      in which we must be saved. <i>Acts</i> iv. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that we must bow at this name?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of Phil. ii. 10. That in the name of Jesus every knee 
      should bow of those that are in heaven, on earth and in hell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the name Christ?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies anointed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was he called anointed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because he was a priest, a prophet, and a king to all 
      which unction pertains.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. With what was Christ anointed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. With all the plenitude of divine grace.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;[pg. 13]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean the words, his only Son 
      our Lord?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They mean that Jesus Christ is the only Son of God the 
      Father, begotten, as he is God, and of the same Father from all eternity, 
      without a mother; and therefore is coequal and consubstantial to his 
      Father; and consequently infinite, omnipotent Creator, and so Lord of us 
      and all things, as the Father is.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the third article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin 
      Mary.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that the second Person of the blessed Trinity 
      took flesh of the Virgin Mary, not by a human generation, but by the work 
      of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of St. Luke i. 31, 35. Behold (saith the angel) thou 
      shalt conceive and bear a Son, &amp;c. the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, 
      and the virtue of the Highest shall overshadow thee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by the words, born of the Virgin Mary?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that Christ was born of her at midnight, in a 
      poor stable at Bethlehem, between an ox and an ass.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why at midnight?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that he came to take away the darkness of our 
      sins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why in Bethlehem?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it was the head city of David's family, and Christ 
      was of David's race.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why in a poor stable?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To teach us to love poverty and contempt of this world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why between an ox and an ass?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To fulfil that of the prophet, Thou shalt be known, O 
      Lord, between two beasts, Habacuc xii. <i>juxta</i> Sept.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What doth the birth of Christ avail us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It perfecteth in us faith, hope, and charity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies, &quot;born of the Virgin Mary?&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;[pg. 14]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies that Our Lady was a 
      virgin not only before, but also in, and after childbirth.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp; <i>The Fourth Article.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the fourth 
      article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified dead and 
      buried.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by suffering under Pontius Pilate?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that Christ, after a painful life of 
      thirty-three years, suffered most bitter torments under the wicked 
      president Pontius Pilate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Where did he begin those sufferings?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the garden of Gethsemani; that as sin began in the 
      garden by the first Adam, so might grace also, by the second.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are those torments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His bloody sweat, his whipping at the pillar, his purple 
      garment, his crown of thorns, his Sceptre of a reed, his carrying the 
      cross, and many others.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by the words, was crucified?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand, he was nailed to a disgraceful cross between 
      two thieves, for our offences, and to save us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful to honour the cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, with a relative honour it is, because it is a special 
      memorial of our Saviour's passion, and is called the sign of the Son of 
      man, St. <i>Matt.</i> xxiv. 30.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other reason have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the cross was the sacred altar, on which Christ 
      offered his bloody sacrifice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What scripture have you for it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Gal.</i> vi. 14. 'God forbid, (saith St. Paul,) that I 
      should glory, but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Phil.</i> iii. 18. Many walk (saith St. Paul) of 
      whom I have often told you, and now again weeping, I tell you that they 
      are enemies to the cross of Christ, &amp;c. whose end is perdition. And out of 
      Ezek. ix. 4, where we read, That such as were signed with the sign <i>Tau</i>, 
      (which was a picture and figure of the cross,) were saved from the 
      exterminating angel, and only such.</p>
      <p>[pg. 15]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the word dead?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies that Christ suffered a true and real death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was it requisite he should die?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To free us from the death of sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why died he, crying with a loud voice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To show he had power of his own life; and he freely gave 
      it up for us, being strong and vigorous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why died he bowing down his head?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify his obedience to his Father, in the acceptance 
      of his disgraceful death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means buried?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means, that his body was laid in a new sepulchre, and 
      buried with honour, as the prophet had foretold, <i>Isa.</i> xi. 10.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Fifth Article</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the fifth article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He descended into hell, the third day he arose again from 
      the dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, he descended into Hell?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means, that as soon as Christ was dead, he descended 
      into <i>Limbo,</i> to free the holy fathers who were there.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of<i> Acts</i> ii. 24, 27. 'Christ being slain, God 
      raised him up loosing the sorrows of hell, as it was foretold by the 
      prophet,' <i>Psalm</i> xv. 10. 'Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor 
      wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Ephes.</i> iv. 8, 9. 'He ascending on high, hath led 
      captivity captive; he gave gifts to men; and that he ascended,' what is it 
      but because he descended into the lower parts of the earth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Did he not descend to purgatory to free such as were 
      there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is most probable he did according to 1 <i>Pet</i>. iii. 
      19, 20. 'Christ being dead, came in spirit; and preached to them also that 
      were in prison, who had been incredulous in the days of Noah, when the ark 
      was building.'</p>
      <p>[pg. 16]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by, on the third 
      day he rose again from the dead?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand, when Christ had been dead part of three 
      days, on the third day, which was Sunday, he raised up his blessed body 
      from the dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why did he not raise it again sooner?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To testify that he was truly dead, and to fulfil the 
      prophecies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Did he reassume all the parts of his body?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He did, even to the last drop of his vital blood, and the 
      very scattered hairs of his head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why did he retain the stigmas and marks of the sacred 
      wounds?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To confound the incredulity of men, and to present them 
      often to his Father, as a propitiation of our sins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What benefit have we by the resurrection?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It confirms our faith and hope, that we shall rise again 
      from death: 'For he who raised up Jesus will raise us also with Jesus.' 2
      <i>Cor.</i> iv. 14.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the sixth article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He ascended into heaven, sits on the right hand of God the 
      Father Almighty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, He ascended into heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that when Christ had conversed forty days on 
      earth with his disciples, after his resurrection, teaching them heavenly 
      things, then he ascended triumphant into heaven, by his own power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. From what place did he ascend?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From the top of Mount Olivet, where the print of his 
      blessed feet are seen to this day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why from thence?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That were he began to be humbled by his passion, there he 
      might also begin to be exalted.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Before whom did he ascend?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Before his mother, apostles and disciples, <i>Acts</i> 1. 
      9, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what manner did he ascend?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Lifting up his hands, and blessing them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it added, Into Heaven?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;[pg. 17]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To draw our hearts to heaven after 
      Him; 'If ye have risen with Christ, seek ye the things which are above.'
      <i>Col.</i> iii. 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by, Sits at the right hand of God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I do not understand, that God the Father hath any hands, 
      for he is incorporated, and a spirit: but that Christ is equal to his 
      Father in power and majesty, as he is God; and that as man he is the 
      highest created glory.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From thence he will come to judge the living and the dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by this article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand Christ will come at the last day from heaven, 
      to judge all men according to their work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Does every man receive a particular judgment at his death?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He doth, but in the general judgment we shall be judged 
      not only in our souls, as at our death, but also in our bodies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is that necessary?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That as Christ was openly rejected, so he may there be 
      openly acknowledged to the great joy and glory of his friends, as also to 
      the confusion of his enemies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that in the judgment all men shall receive 
      according to their works?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 2 <i>Cor</i>. v. 10. 'We must all be manifested 
      (saith St. Paul) before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may 
      receive the proper things of the body according as he hath done, whether 
      good or evil.' And out of St. <i>Matt</i>. xvi. 27. 'The Son of man (saith 
      our Lord) shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, and then 
      he will render to every one according to his works.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any merit in our good works?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is, according to <i>Apoc</i>. xxii. 12. Behold I 
      come quickly (saith the Lord) and my reward is with me; to render to every 
      man according to his works.'</p>
      <p>[pg. 18]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what place shall this judgment be made?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the Valley of Jehosaphat, as many suppose between 
      Jerusalem and Mount of Olivet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By its conformity to that of the prophet. I will gather 
      together all nations, I will send them into the Valley of Jehosaphat, and 
      there will I plead with them upon my people, and my inheritance <i>
      Israel,' Joel</i> iii.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signs shall go before it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The sun and moon shall lose their lights, there shall be 
      wars, plagues, famines, and earthquakes, in many places.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what manner will Christ come unto it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In great power and majesty, attended with legions of 
      angels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who are they that shall be judged?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The whole race and progeny of man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the things that shall be judged?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Our thoughts, words, and works, even to the secrets of our 
      souls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who will accuse us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Devils, and our own guilty consciences: in which all 
      our thoughts, words and deeds shall presently appear, and be laid open to 
      the whole world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How shall the just and reprobate be placed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The just shall be on the right; the reprobate on the left 
      hand of the Judge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What shall be the sentence of the just?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. 'Come, O ye blessed of my Father, and receive ye the 
      kingdom which is prepared for you, for I was hungry and ye gave me to eat, 
      I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink,' &amp;c St. <i>Matt.</i> xxv. 35, 36.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What shall be the sentence of the reprobate?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. 'Go ye cursed into eternal fire, which hath been prepared 
      for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and ye gave me not to 
      eat,' &amp;c. the same chap. v. 41, 42. You see of what weight good works will 
      be at that day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it added, the living and the dead?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that Christ shall judge, not only such as are

      <p>[pg. 19]</p>

      <p align="center"><i>The Eighth Article</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      eight article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I believe in the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Of what treats this article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Of the third Person of the blessed Trinity, in whom we 
      also believe and put our trust, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, 
      and is the self-same God with them, distinct in nothing but in person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>John</i> v. 7. 'There are three that give 
      testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these 
      three are one.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the name of the Holy Ghost appropriated to the 
      third Person, since angels are all spirits and holy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because he is such by excellency and essence, they only by 
      participation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. At least why should it not be common to the other two 
      persons?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are known by the proper names of Father and 
      Son, but we have not any proper name for the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what forms has the Holy Ghost appeared unto man?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the form of a dove, to signify the purity and innocence 
      which he caused in our souls; and in the form of a bright cloud, and fiery 
      tongue, to signify the fire of charity, which he produced in our hearts, 
      as also the gift of tongues; and hence it is, he is painted in these 
      forms.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Ninth Article</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the ninth article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I believe in the holy Catholic Church, the communion of 
      saints.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that Christ hath a church upon earth which he 
      established in his own blood, and that he hath</p>
      <p>[pg. 20]</p>
      <p>commanded us to believe that church, in all things appertaining to 
      faith, and morals, <i>Matt.</i> xviii. 17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What kind of faith must we believe her with?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. With the same faith that we believe her Spouse the Son of 
      God, that is, with divine faith, but with this difference among other, 
      that we believe in God; but though we believe the church, yet we do not 
      properly believe in the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the congregation of all the faithful under Jesus 
      Christ, their invisible head, and his vicar upon earth, the Pope.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the essential parts of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A Pope or supreme head, bishops, pastors, and laity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that bishops are of divine institution?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Acts</i> xx. 28. Take heed unto yourselves, and 
      to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost hath placed you bishops, to 
      rule the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How believe you St. Peter, and the Pope his successor, to 
      be the visible head of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of St. <i>John</i> xxi. 16, 17, and 18, where 
      Christ gave St. Peter (for a reward of his special faith and love) 
      absolute power to feed and govern his whole flock, saying, Feed my Lambs, 
      feed my lambs, feed my sheep; therefore the rest of the apostles were his 
      sheep, and he their head or pastor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of St. <i>Matt.</i> xvi. 18, where Christ 
      saith, <i>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my church.</i> 
      Therefore the rest of the apostles were built on him; and hence also it 
      is, that in Scripture, St. Peter is still named first.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the marks of the true church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Unity, sanctity, universality, and to be apostolical.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean you by the church's unity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That all her members live under one evangelical law, obey 
      the same supreme head, and his magistrates profess the same faith, even to 
      the last article, and use the same sacraments and sacrifices.</p>
      <p>[pg. 21]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you out of Scripture that the church is 
      one?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. 1 <i>Cor</i>. x. 17. Being many (saith St. <i>Paul</i>) we 
      are one bread, one body, all who participate of one bread.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why may not a well-meaning person be saved in any 
      religion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because there is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism, <i>
      Ephes.</i> iv. 5, and without (that one) faith, it is impossible to please 
      God. <i>Heb.</i> xi. 6.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other reason have you for it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because, as in a natural body, that part which has not a 
      due connection to the heart or root, presently dies for want of 
      continuity; so in the church (the mystical body of Christ) that man who 
      has not a due subordination and connection to the head and common councils 
      thereof, (that is, the Pope and general councils from whence under Christ 
      we have our spiritual life and motion, as we are Christians,) must needs 
      be dead, nor indeed can he be accounted a member of that mystical body.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who, I beseech you, are those who are not to be accounted 
      members of the Church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All such as are not in the unity of the church, by a most 
      firm belief of her doctrine, and due obedience to her pastors; as Jews, 
      Turks, Heretics, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why may not Heretics and Schismatics justly claim to be in 
      the Unity of the Church and Members of Christ's body?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because Catholics can show to each sect of Heretics and 
      Schismatics the time they began; the date of their separation from the 
      Church: the name of the person or persons of their sect who first 
      separated themselves, and the cause of their condemnation; whilst the 
      Catholic Church always was from the beginning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if a Protestant should tell you, that the difference 
      between them and us, are not differences in fundamentals, or in faith, but 
      in opinion only, and therefore do not exclude them out of unity of the 
      Catholic Church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I should answer, they contradict themselves; for they 
      accuse us of robbing God of his honour, in holding priestly absolutions 
      from sins; in adoring Christ's body</p>
      <p>[pg. 22]</p>
      <p>and blood, as really present in the eucharist, and holding the Pope's 
      supremacy in things belonging to the spiritual government of the Church, 
      also the infallibility of the Church and general councils, in delivering 
      and defining points of faith, which are no matters of indifference, but 
      high fundamentals.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove all obstinate Innovators to be Heretics?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they wilfully stand out against the definitive 
      sentence of the Church of God, and submit not to any tribunal appointed by 
      Christ to decide religious controversies; but follow their own 
      interpretation of the dead letter of the scriptures.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. And is not this the reason also why Protestants and all 
      other sectarians are so divided in religious matters?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, it is; for how is it possible that people who imagine 
      that there is no person or tribunal, or even the Church of God, 
      infallible, for expounding the bible; people, who expound it each 
      according to his respective fancy; people, who have no control over the 
      erroneous interpretation of each other; how it is possible that such 
      people would have the unity of faith, in the bond of peace; or that they 
      be not tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why may not the letter of the Scripture be a decisive 
      judge of controversies?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it has never been able from it[s] first 
      publication, to decide any one dispute; as the whole world knows from 
      experience: all heretics equally pretend to scripture authority in defence 
      of their errors and heresies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How then can we ascertain the truth amidst conflicting 
      opinions?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the infallible authority, definition, and proposition 
      of the Catholic Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end, then, was the Scripture written, if not to 
      be a decider of controversies?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The writing of the Holy Scriptures was for the purpose of 
      the better preserving the revealed will of God, and that by a sensible and 
      common reading of it, without any critical or controversial disputes of 
      words, we might be able to know that God is, and what he is, and</p>
      <p>[pg. 23]</p>
      <p>also that there is a heaven and a hell, rewards for virtue and 
      punishment for vice, with examples of both, all which we find in the 
      letter of the Scripture, by a plain and ordinary reading.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is the church we speak of visible?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. She is and must be visible at all times, as consisting of 
      a hierarchy of pastors, governing, teaching, administering sacraments to 
      the world's end, and of other people governed, taught and receiving 
      sacraments at their hands, all publicly professing the same faith, all 
      which things are visible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Eph.</i> iv. 1, and 12. 'Christ gave some 
      apostles, some evangelists, some doctors, some pastors, to the 
      consummation of the saints, to the edifying of the body of Christ, and to 
      the work of the ministry, until we all meet in the unity of faith.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of St. <i>Matt.</i> v. 14, where Christ saith 
      of his church, &quot;You are the light of the <i>world</i>, a city seated on a 
      high mountain cannot be hid.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then would the Protestants have the church to be 
      invisible?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because we have convinced them, that there were no 
      Protestants to be seen or heard of in the world before <i>Martin Luther.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the church said to be holy, or to have sanctity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because she hath a holy faith, a holy law, holy 
      sacraments, and is guided by the Holy Ghost, to all truth and holiness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How else prove you her sanctity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because Christ gave himself for his church that he might 
      sanctify her, cleansing her by the laver of water in the world, that he 
      might present her to himself a glorious church, not having spot or 
      wrinkle, but that she might be holy and unspotted. <i>Eph.</i> v. 26, 27.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Notwithstanding the sanctity of the Catholic Church, are 
      not some Catholics as wicked as Protestants?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, verily, and more wicked, for where sanctity is less, 
      their sacrilege cannot be so great. No man could damn his own posterity, 
      but he that had original justice</p>
      <p>[pg. 24]</p>
      <p>to lose: nor any man to betray Christ, but he that had eaten at his 
      table. Protestants have not a holy faith, such sacraments, nor a holy 
      church to abuse, as Catholics have, and therefore no wonder, if some 
      Catholics be worse than any Protestants; yet Catholics have some saints, 
      but Protestants have none.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is the church infallible?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. She is, and therefore to be believed, and all men may rest 
      securely on her judgment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, because she is the pillar and ground of truth 1 <i>
      Tim.</i> iii. 15.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of St. <i>Matt.</i> xvi. 18, where Christ 
      saith, &quot;Upon this Rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall 
      not prevail against her.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of St. <i>John</i>, xiv. 26. But the Paraclete, 
      (saith he,) the Holy Ghost, shall teach you all things whatsoever I shall 
      say to you. And xvi. 13. But when the Spirit of truth cometh, he shall 
      teach you all truth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How declare you that the definitions of a council 
      perfectly ecumenical, that is, a general council approved by the Pope, are 
      infallible in matters of faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because such a council is the church representative, and 
      has the same infallibility that the church spread over the world hath.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other reason have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because of the definitions of such a council are the 
      dictates of the Holy Ghost, according to that of the apostles, deciding in 
      council, it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, <i>Acts</i> xv. 
      28.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What think you then of such as accuse the church of errors 
      in faith and idolatry?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Truly I think them to be Heretics or Infidels, for our 
      Lord saith, He that will not hear the church let him be unto thee as a 
      heathen and a publican, St. <i>Matt</i>. xviii. 17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is not the church at least too severe in its censures and 
      excommunications against sectaries?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, she is very reasonable and charitable in them for 
      vicious, passionate, and self-interested men some times are brought to 
      reason for fear of punishment</p>
      <p>[pg. 25]</p>
      <p>and are forced to their own good, when no authority ordained by Christ 
      is able to persuade them to it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understood you by the word catholic, or by the 
      universality of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand the church is universal, both for time and 
      place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How for time?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because she hath been from Christ to this time, and shall 
      be from thence to the end of the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of St. <i>Matt.</i> xxviii. 20. Going therefore (saith 
      our Lord) teach ye all nations, &amp;c. and behold I am with you all days, 
      even to the consummation of the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean you by the universality of place?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of St. <i>Matt.</i> above cited, Teach all 
      nations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly out of Psalm lxxxv. 9. All Nations, whatsoever thou 
      hast made, shall come and adore before thee, O Lord.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Apoc.</i> vii. 9, where we read, that the 
      church shall be gathered out of all nations, people, tribes, and tongues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we call the church the Roman Church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because, since the transition of St. Peter's chair from 
      Antioch to Rome, the particular Roman Church has been head of all the 
      churches, and to her the primacy has been affixed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the rule by which the church preserves entire the 
      deposit of Faith and confounds all sectaries?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Apostolical traditions, or receipt of doctrine by hand to 
      hand from Christ and his apostles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of Rom. vi. 17. &quot;Therefore I beseech you, brethren 
      (saith St. <i>Paul</i>) mark them which make dissensions and scandals, 
      contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them, for such 
      do not serve Christ our Lord.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 26]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proofs have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of St. Paul, saying, &quot;But although we or an angel from 
      heaven evangelize to you, besides that which we have evangelized to you, 
      be he anathema, or besides, what you have received be he anathema.&quot; <i>
      Gal.</i> i. 8, 9.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can the church err in faith, standing to this rule, and 
      admitting nothing for faith, but what is consented by the whole church to 
      have been so received?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. She cannot, otherwise the whole church must there conspire 
      in a notorious lie, to damn herself and her posterity, or else she must be 
      ignorant what hath been taught for her faith by the church of the 
      precedent age, which are both natural impossibilities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you these to be impossibilities by nature?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the constancy and immutability of contingent causes, 
      whose particulars may be defective, but the universals cannot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Explain that a little.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because one man or two or three may be born but with one 
      arm, or one eye only, through defect of their particular causes; but that 
      all nature should fail at once, and all men be so born, is totally 
      impossible in nature; in like manner, one man or two may conspire in 
      palpable lies to damn themselves and their posterity, or be deceived in 
      what hath been taught them for faith, from their very cradles; but that 
      the whole church should so far break with the nature of man (which is 
      reason) to conspire in such a lie, or to be so mistaken, is as impossible 
      in nature, as it is for men to be no men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. May some errors have been received for faith, and crept 
      insensibly over the whole church, no man perceiving or taking notice of 
      them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, that is as impossible as that the plague or burning 
      fever should infect or spread itself over a whole kingdom for many years, 
      no man perceiving it, or seeking to prevent it; for nothing causes greater 
      notice to be taken, than any public or notorious change in matters of 
      religion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. May not the power of temporal princes, or the</p>
      <p>[pg. 27]</p>
      <p>over prevalency of human wit and reason, have introduced errors into 
      the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Neither is that possible, seeing we are not regulated in 
      things which are of faith, either by power, or any strength of reason, but 
      by the rule of apostolical tradition, and by inquiring of the whole church 
      of every age, what hath been taught by our forefathers, from Christ and 
      his apostles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Was not the Millenary heresy an apostolical tradition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, it was not; for there is no assurance or consent among 
      those who write of it, that it was ever preached or delivered by the 
      apostles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Did not St. <i>Austin</i> and <i>Innocentius</i>, with 
      their councils, hold the communion of children a thing necessary to their 
      salvation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They speak not of sacramental communion, as is evident to 
      all who have read their works, but of the effect of it, that is, of their 
      incorporation into the mystical body of Christ, which is made in baptism, 
      and this only they affirmed to be necessary to their salvation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. At least do not heretics say and aver, that the church 
      hath apostatized and erred in faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They do indeed, but it will not serve their turn barely to 
      say it, unless they were also able to prove it, (which they neither are or 
      will be) by evident and undeniable proofs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, because that presumption and possession of her 
      integrity and infallibility is on the church's side; and therefore ought 
      not to be yielded up, without clear evidence of her prevarication.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because he that accuses his neighbour's wife of 
      adultery, without convincing proof thereof, is not to be hearkened unto, 
      but to be hated by all good men, as a most infamous slanderer; much more 
      ought they who shall accuse the church, the spouse of Christ, of errors 
      and apostasy, unless their proofs be evident and undeniable, to be 
      detested as blasphemous heretics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, because if less than manifest and convincing 
      evidence be sufficient to prove matters of this high na-</p>
      <p>[pg. 28]</p>
      <p>ture, it is not impossible but every false tongue shall set dissensions 
      between man and wife, and stir up the most faithful subjects in the world 
      to a rebellion against their princes, both spiritual and temporal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other reason have you yet, why the church and law of 
      Christ may not fail and be utterly extinguished?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the causes of religion (to wit, the hope of good, 
      and fear of evil from God) are universal and necessary, always knocking at 
      men's hearts, and putting them in mind of some good or other, and 
      therefore must needs have perpetual and necessary effects, which in such 
      as are convinced that Christ is God, can be no other than the faith, hope 
      and love of Christ, and the observance of his law, and that for ever, 
      speaking of the whole church, although particular men may err and fall 
      away.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is it for the church to be apostolical?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To have been begun and propagated by the apostles, and to 
      have a succession of pastors, and doctrines from them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the communion of saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means first that the faithful do all communicate in the 
      same faith and sacraments, in the same sacrifice, and also in the merits 
      of one another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>1 Cor</i>. xii. 26. And if one member suffer any 
      thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member do glory, all the 
      members rejoice with it, you are the body of Christ, and members of a 
      member.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, It means that the faithful on earth communicate 
      with the angels and the saints in heaven; we by praising and praying to 
      them, they by praying for us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove this communion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Luke</i> xv. 10. There is joy before the angels 
      of God upon one sinner that doth penance. And out of 1 John i. 3, That you 
      also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship may be with the 
      Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the saints have any power to do us 
      good?</p>
      <p>[pg. 29]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Apoc</i>. ii. 26, 27, 
      where Christ hath promised them power over us: to him, said he, that shall 
      overcome, and keep my works to the end, to him will I give power over 
      nations, and he shall rule them with an iron rod.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that it is lawful to pray to angels?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Apoc</i>. i. 4, where St. John did it: Grace 
      (saith he) to you, and peace from him that is, that was, and that shall 
      come, and from the seven spirits that are in the sight of his throne.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Apoc</i>. viii. 4, where we read, that they 
      present the church's prayers to God. The smoke of the incense of the 
      prayers of the saints ascend from the hand of the angel before God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that we may pray to saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Gen</i>. xlvii, 16, where Jacob taught his 
      children to do it, saying, And let my name be invocated upon them, the 
      names also of my fathers, <i>Abraham</i> and <i>Isaac</i>. Q. How prove 
      you that they pray for us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Apoc</i>. v. 8. The twenty-four elders fell down 
      before the Lamb, having every one harps, and vials full of odours, which 
      are the prayers of the saints.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it no dishonour to God, for us to pray to saints to 
      pray for us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, it is not, nor yet to beg it of men; for <i>St. Paul</i> 
      did it: We hope (saith he) that God will deliver us, you also helping in 
      prayer for us. 2 <i>Cor</i>. i. 11.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Tenth Article.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the tenth article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The forgiveness of sins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do you understand by this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that God is both able and willing to forgive 
      our sins, if we be heartily sorry for them, and confess them; and have 
      given power to his church to remit them by baptism and penance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of Matt. ix. 8, where it is recorded by the</p>
      <p>[pg. 30]</p>
      <p align="left">Holy Ghost, that the multitude glorified God, who hath 
      given such power unto man, as to forgive sins, (Christ having before 
      proved the said power by a miracle) ver. 6, 7.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is any sin so great that God cannot forgive it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No there is not; for his mercy is far above our malice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can any one mortal sin be remitted without the rest?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It cannot, because the remission of mortal sin is a 
      renewing of friendship with God by his grace, which can never be effected, 
      so long as there remains in us any mortal sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can we have absolute certainty, that our sins are forgiven 
      us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Without special revelation we cannot: I am not guilty in 
      conscience (saith St. <i>Paul</i>) of any thing, but herein I am not 
      justified. 1 <i>Cor.</i> iv. 4.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because a man knows not whether he be worthy of love or 
      hatred. <i>Eccl</i>. i. 9.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can we be certain of our final perseverance?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not without special revelation, and therefore St. <i>Paul</i> 
      said, I chastise my body and bring it into subjection, lest when I preach 
      to others I myself become a reprobate, 1 <i>Cor.</i> ix. 27, and <i>Phil</i>. 
      ii. 12. He exhorts, saying, with fear and trembling, work out your 
      salvation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How then shall we have peace of conscience?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because we may have moral certainty and a most lively 
      hope, that our sins are forgiven by us by the due use of the sacraments, 
      which is enough for our peace.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Eleventh Article.</i></p>

      article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The resurrection of the flesh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means this article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that these very bodies in which we now live, 
      shall at the day of judgment be all raised up from death to life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By what means shall this be done?</p>
      <p>[pg. 31]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the omnipotent command of God, and the 
      ministry of angels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Thess</i>. iv. 16. For our Lord in 
      commandment, and in the voice of an archangel, and in the trumpet of God, 
      will descend from heaven, and the dead that are in Christ shall rise 
      again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Shall the same bodies rise again?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The same in substance, though different in qualities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Job</i> xix. 25, 26, 27. For I know that my 
      Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth, and 
      shall be compassed again with my skin, and in my flesh I shall see God, 
      whom I myself shall see, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What shall be the qualities or doweries of a glorified 
      body?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Impassability, agility, clarity, subtility.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove its impassability, or incorruptibility?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor</i>. xv. 53. For this corruptible must put 
      on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you its agility?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of the same chapter, ver. 43, 44. It is sown in 
      infirmity, it shall rise in power; it is sown a natural body, but it shall 
      rise in a spiritual body, (that is, in motion, and some operations equal 
      to a spirit;) which also proves its subtility.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you it clarity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of the same chapter, ver. 24 &quot;For star (said he) 
      differs from star in glory, so also the resurrection of the dead.&quot; And ver. 
      43. &quot;It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what space of time shall the dead rise, and the elect 
      be thus changed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &quot;In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,&quot; 1 <i>Cor</i>. 
      xv, 52.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. At what age and stature shall men rise?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. At a perfect age, which is thirty-three, and in that 
      stature which they should have had at a perfect age, without deformity by 
      defect or excess.</p>
      <p>[pg. 32]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Ephes</i>. iv. 13. &quot;The church shall last until 
      we all meet into a perfect may, into the measure of the age of the fulness 
      of Christ.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What example have you in nature for the resurrection?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A grain of corn, which first rots in the earth and then 
      springs up and lives again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What benefit have we by the knowledge of the resurrection?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It emboldens us to suffer persecution and death itself, in 
      hope of future glory, according to that of <i>St. Paul</i>: &quot;For 
      sufferings of these times are not comparable to that of future glory, 
      which be revealed in us:&quot; <i>Rom</i>. viii. 18.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the twelfth 
      article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. And life everlasting.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is this the last article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because everlasting life is the last end of man, and the 
      last reward we expect by faith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by this article?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that such as keep the commandments, and die 
      in the state of grace, shall live with God in bliss forever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that keeping the commandments is of 
      necessity for obtaining it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt</i>. xix. 17, where Christ said to the 
      young man, asking what he should do to obtain it, &quot;If thou wilt enter into 
      life, keep the commandments.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is everlasting life given as a reward of our good works?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, according to <i>Rom</i>. ii. 6, 7. &quot;God will render 
      to every one according to his works, to them truly, that according to 
      patience in good works, seek glory and honour, and incorruption life 
      everlasting&quot; &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Were all men created for everlasting life?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They were, for God &quot;would have all men to be saved,&quot; 1 <i>
      Tim</i>. ii. 4. &quot;He willeth not the death of any sinner, but rather that 
      he be converted and live.&quot; <i>Ezek</i>. xxxiii. 11.</p>
      <p>[pg. 33]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then are many damned?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By reason of their own wilful transgression of God's law, 
      and final impenitence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that man is the free cause of his own sin 
      and damnation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of <i>Job</i> xi. 23. &quot;God (saith he) hath given 
      him place for penance, but he abuseth it unto pride.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Hos.</i> xiii. 9. &quot;The perdition is from 
      thyself, O Israel; in me only is thy aid.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Rom</i>. ii. 4. &quot;The benignity of God 
      calls thee to repentance, but thou heapest to thyself wrath and 
      indignation, according to thy own impenitent heart.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what consists everlasting life?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the clear vision and fruition of God, according to that 
      of our Saviour, in <i>John</i> xvii. 3. &quot;This is the life everlasting, 
      that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast 
      sent.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Shall we see nothing in Heaven but God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, all the attributes and perfections of God, and in him 
      also, as in a mirror or looking glass, the nature and perfections of all 
      creatures; for he contains all things in himself in the most eminent 
      manner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of the apostle, saying, &quot;from whom all things by whom 
      all things, and in whom all things.&quot; <i>Rom</i> xi. 36.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What effect will follow out the clear vision and fruition 
      of God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A divine love, steadfast possession and ineffable joy; and 
      out of that praise, jubilation, and thanksgiving for ever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the word <i>Amen</i>? A. It means that the 
      whole creed is divine truth, and therefore we most heartily assent to it.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Hope and Prayer Explained.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is Hope?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a virtue infused by God into the soul, by which we 
      have a confident expectation of glory to be</p>
      <p>[pg. 34]</p>
      <p>obtained by the grace and merits of Christ, and our own merits 
      proceeding from his grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. On what is the confidence chiefly grounded?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. On the merits and promises of Christ, who hath promised 
      glory to such as hope in him, and do his works, as also grace whereby to 
      do them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are our good works then meritorious of a reward of glory?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. As proceeding from the grace of Christ, and built upon his 
      promises, they are.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Mark</i> ix. 14. &quot;For whosoever shall 
      give you to drink a cup of water in my name because you are Christ's, 
      Amen, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of 1 <i>Cor</i>. iii. 8. &quot;And every one shall 
      receive his own reward, according to his own labour, for we are God's 
      coadjutors.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Matt</i>. v. 11. &quot;Blessed are ye (saith 
      our Lord) when they shall revile and persecute you; for very great is your 
      reward in heaven.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful for us to do good works in the hope of a 
      reward?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not only lawful but laudable, according to that, I &quot;have 
      inclined by heart, to do thy justifications for ever, for a reward.&quot; <i>
      Psalm</i> cxviii. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>John</i> iii. 22. &quot;Whatsoever (saith he) we 
      shall ask of God, we shall receive of him, because we keep his 
      commandments, and do those things that are pleasing before him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How declare you the necessity of hope?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it produces in us obedience to the law of God, as 
      also a willingness to suffer for his sake, and final perseverance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Job</i> xiii. 15. &quot;Although he kill me, yet will 
      I hope in him.&quot; And <i>Psalm</i> lv. 5. &quot;In God have I hoped, I will not 
      fear what flesh can do unto me.&quot;<br>
      It is according to the Psalmist, &quot;Him that hopeth in our Lord, merely 
      shall encompass.&quot; <i>Psalm</i> xxxi. 10.</p>
      <p>[pg. 35]</p>
      <p>And, &quot;Our Lord is well pleased in them that hope in his mercy.&quot; <i>
      Psalm</i> cxlvi. 11.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other good doth Hope?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It moves us to devout and humble prayer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is prayer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the lifting up of the mind to God, by which we beg 
      for good things and to be free from evils, or by which we bless and praise 
      God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the conditions of good prayer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That it may be made with reverence, attention, humility, 
      and perseverance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What vices are opposite to hope?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Despair and presumption.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is despair?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a diffidence in the mercy of God, and merits of 
      Christ, even to death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is presumption?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a foolish and desperate confidence of salvation, 
      without endeavouring to live well or keep the commandments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How is the despair the cause of sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because despairing men are wont to say, if I shall be 
      damned, I shall be damned, and so use no endeavour to do good or avoid 
      evil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How is presumption the cause of sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because presumptuous men used to say, God is merciful and 
      will forgive our sins, how great soever, and at what time soever, we do 
      penance; and out of this take liberty to sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How must our hope be balanced between these two extremes?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By a filial fear, and an humble distrust of our own works, 
      as they are ours.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is prayer good against both these?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, according to that of <i>Luke</i> xxii. 40, &quot;pray ye 
      that so ye may not fall into temptation.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what else availeth prayer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For the avoiding of evils and the obtaining all benefits.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John</i> xv 23. &quot;Whatsoever (saith our Sa-</p>
      <p>[pg. 36]</p>
      <p>viour) ye shall ask my Father in my name, he will give it you.&quot; And <i>
      Luke</i> xi. 9. &quot;Ask and it shall be given you,&quot; &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful to pray in an unknown tongue?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, &quot;for he that speaks in a tongue (unknown) speaks 
      not to men but to God.&quot; 1 <i>Cor</i>. xiv. 2. And a petition has the same 
      force if it be understood by him that is petitioned, whether the 
      petitioner understood it or not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of the same chap. ver. 16, 17, where <i>Paul</i> 
      saith, &quot;but if thou bless in spirit, (that is in a tongue not known) he 
      that supplieth the place of the vulgar, how shall he say Amen, &amp;c. thou 
      indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.&quot; You see in 
      itself the thing is good, for he gives thanks well.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the apostle, when he exhorts us to pray always?
      <i>Thess</i>. v. 17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He means we should daily spend some time to prayer, 
      according to James v. 16. &quot;Pray for one another that you may be saved, for 
      the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it possible to pray always?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In some sense it is: namely, by offering up all our 
      actions to God's honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what place is prayer best?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In churches: because these are places consecrated and 
      devoted to prayer, and there our prayers are elevated by the peculiar 
      presence of God, and his special assistance besought by the Church's 
      pastors in the consecration of those places.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt</i>. xviii. 20. &quot;Where there are two or 
      three gathered together in my name (saith the Lord) there I am in the 
      midst of them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that material churches are of God's 
      appointment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, Because God commanded <i>Solomon </i>to build him a 
      temple, and dedicate it to his service. 2 <i>Paral</i> vii. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Luke</i> xix. 46, where Christ calls the</p>
      <p>[pg. 37]</p>
      <p>material temple his house, casing the buyers and sellers out of it. &quot;My 
      house, (saith he) is the house of prayer, but you have made it a den of 
      thieves.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Luke xviii. 10,</i> where the publican 
      &quot;ascended to the temple to pray, and descended into his house justified.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it lawful to dedicate of consecrate 
      material temples?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of Paralip. above cited, chap. 7, and out of <i>John</i> 
      x. 22, where it is recorded that <i>Christ</i><br>
      himself kept the dedication of the temple in <i>Jerusalem,</i> instituted 
      by <i>Judas Maccabæus</i>, 1 <i>Mac.</i> iv. 56, 59.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it lawful to adorn the churches with 
      tapestry, pictures, and the like?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Mark</i>, xiv. 15, where Christ commanded his 
      last supper to be prepared in a great chamber adorned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What proof have you for the order and number of the 
      canonical hours?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For Matins, Lauds, and Prime, that of <i>Psalm</i> v. 4 
      &quot;Early in the morning will I stand up to thee, early in the morning wilt 
      thou hear my voice.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What for the third, sixth and ninth hours?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For the third out of <i>Acts</i> ii. 16. &quot;At the third 
      hour the Holy Ghost descended on the Apostles.&quot; For the sixth, out of <i>
      Acts</i> x. 9. &quot;Peter and John went up into the higher part to pray about 
      the sixth hour:&quot; and for the ninth, out of <i>Acts</i> iii. 1. &quot;And at the 
      ninth hour Peter and John went up into the temple to pray.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What for the Even-song and Complin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That of the <i>Psalmist</i>, &quot;Morning and evening, will I 
      declare the works of our Lord,&quot; <i>Psalm</i> liv. 18. and again, &quot;lifting 
      up of my hands is as an evening sacrifice,&quot; cxli 2.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it good to use outward ceremonies in a time of prayer, 
      as kneeling, knocking the breast, and such like?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, for they declare the inward reverence and devotion 
      of the heart; and Christ himself prostrated, when he prayed in the garden,
      <i>Matt</i>. xxvi. 39. And the poor publican beat his breast, and cast 
      down his</p>
      <p>[pg. 38]</p>
      <p>eyes in that prayer by which he merited to descend justified, <i>Luke
      </i>xviii. 13, 14.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the morning so fit a time for prayer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To open the windows of the soul to the light of divine 
      grace and offer up the works of the whole day to God's honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the evening also?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To shut the windows of the soul against the darkness of 
      sin, and the illusions of the devil; as also to render thanks for all the 
      benefits of the day past.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What things ought we to pray for?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For all good things both spiritual and temporal, and to be 
      freed from evil; for so our Lord bath taught us by his prayer.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Lord's Prayer Expounded</i></p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q.<i> </i><font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      Pater Noster?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the most holy prayer, that ever was.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who made it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Christ our Lord, the eternal wisdom of his Father, <i>
      Matt.</i> vi. 9.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why did he make it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To teach us a set form of prayer, and how we ought to 
      pray.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why did he make it in so short and plain a manner?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That all persons might be able to understand and practise 
      it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What doth it contain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All those chief things which we can ask or hope for of 
      God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How many petitions does it contain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Seven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by these words, which are prefixed to 
      the petition, Our Father who art in Heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that God is our Father, both by creation and 
      by adoption: and if we be in the state of grace, we may confidently come 
      to him, and beg all blessings of him.</p>
      <p>[pg. 39]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>John</i> iii. 1. &quot;See what manner of charity 
      the Father hath given us, that we should be named, and be the sons of 
      God.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do you say, our Father, and not my Father?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God is the common Father of all, and all good 
      Christians must pray for one another,<br>
      according to the article in the Creed. &quot;I believe in the communion of 
      saints.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by the words, Who art in heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that God who fills heaven and earth, and is 
      in all things, times, and places, is in heaven in a peculiar manner, 
      declaring and manifesting his glory to the blessed; and therefore when we 
      pray, we must lift up our minds to him, and keep them fixed upon heavenly 
      things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Jer.</i> xlviii. 10. &quot;Cursed be he that doth the 
      word of God negligently.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The First Petition.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      first petition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Hallowed be thy name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do we beg by this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That God may be known by the whole world, and that he may 
      be worthily praised, served, and honoured by all his creatures, which 
      cannot be effected but by his grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who are these that say this petition ill?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Such as dishonour the name of God by blaspheming, 
      swearing, lying, cursing, and scurrilous disclosures.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. We beg, that our miseries and afflictions in this life may 
      be such, as that we may be made partakers of his joyful and heavenly 
      kingdom hereafter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else do we beg?</p>
      <p>[pg. 40]</p>
      <p align="left">That Christ may reign in us in this life by grace, and in 
      the next by glory, presenting us a kingdom to his Father.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do we beg by this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That God would enable us by his holy grace to keep his 
      commandments, and obey his will in all things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean you by the words, on earth as it is in heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. We beg by those, that we may be as ready and willing to do 
      the will of God on earth, as the blessed saints and angels are in heaven.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Fourth Petition.</i></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do we beg by this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All food and nourishment for our souls and bodies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the food of the soul?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The word of God, the holy sacraments, especially the 
      blessed Eucharist, and divine grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you, that by this petition Christ intended the 
      blessed bread of the <i>Eucharist?</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because in <i>Matt</i>. vi. 11, we read &quot;our 
      supersubstantial bread.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Eucharist </i>called our daily bread?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is daily offered for our sins on the altar, and 
      we ought daily to receive it, at least in spirit and desire.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who say this petition ill?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Such as are cold and careless in coming to the sacraments, 
      and in hearing divine service, or exhortations; and such as ascribe their 
      temporal goods and blessings to their own industry and providence, and not 
      to any special bounty or gift of God.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That God would pardon us the sins of our life past, as 
      also the punishments which are due unto them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are sins, and the penalties of sin, called debts?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they make us debtors to the justice of God, whom 
      by sin we rob of his due honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it added, As we forgive our debtors?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that God will not forgive us, unless we also 
      forgive our brethren; &quot;If you will not forgive men, neither will your 
      Father forgive you your offences.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>vi. 15.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do we beg by this?<br>

      strength.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Doth God tempt any man to sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, &quot;God is not a tempter of evils, he tempts no man.&quot; <i>
      James </i>i. 13.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Ps</i>. v. 7 &quot;Thou art not a God willing 
      iniquity.&quot; And out of <i>Rom. </i>ix. 14. &quot;Is there iniquity with God? No, 
      God forbid.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By whom then are we tempted?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the devil, and our own concupiscence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can a man live in this world, and be free from all 
      temptations?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Morally speaking he cannot: &quot;for the whole life of man on 
      earth is a warfare.&quot; <i>Job </i>vii. 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then do we pray to be delivered from temptation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we may not be overcome, or vanquished by them.</p>
      <p>[pg. 42]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is temptation of itself a sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, not without consent on our part; nay, it is a great 
      occasion of merit, if we resist it as we ought.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Apoc. ii.</i> 10, 11. &quot;Be thou faithful 
      unto death (saith our Lord) and I will give thee the crown of life: he 
      that overcometh, shall not be hurt by the second death.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because Christ himself, who never sinned, would be 
      tempted, &quot;and the tempter came unto him.&quot; &amp;c. <i>Matt</i>. iv. 3.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are we never overcome by by our own default?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Never, according to that answer which was given to St. 
      Paul, desiring to be freed from a temptation &quot;My grace is sufficient for 
      thee.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>James</i> iv. 7. &quot;Resist the devil, and he will 
      flee from you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who are they that say this petition ill?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Such as seek after occasion of sin, and wilfully expose 
      themselves unto temptations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the best remedies against temptations?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To have recourse by humble prayer to God and to his 
      saints, and to such especially as have undergone temptations of the same 
      kind; to resist them valiantly at the first entrance, and to remember 
      often the four last things, death, judgment, hell, and heaven.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Seventh Petition.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the seventh 
      petition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. But deliver us from evil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do we beg by this petition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That God would deliver us from all our evils both 
      spiritual and temporal, especially from the evils of sin past, present, 
      and to come.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who is the author of the evil sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The devil; for &quot;Sin in God there is none.&quot; <i>1 John</i> 
      iii. 5.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Wisdom</i> xiv. 9. &quot;Hateful to God is the 
      impious man and his impiety.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 43]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who say this petition ill?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They who commit their evils before God, and multiply their 
      sins without remorse.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Hail Mary, or Angelical Salutation.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      Hail Mary?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a most honourable salutation to the blessed Virgin 
      Mary, and prayer to her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do your prove it lawful to honour her?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Luke </i>i. 48, where (by inspirations from God; 
      she prophesied, saying, &quot;All generations shall call me blessed.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How may parts hath the Hail Mary?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It hath three parts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the first part?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who made this part?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Holy Ghost, though it was delivered by the angel <i>
      Gabriel, Luke </i>i. 28.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the word Hail?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies, Rejoice or be glad, O Mother of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we invite her by this prayer to rejoice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it renews the memory of her blessed Son's 
      conception, which is an infinite cause of joy to her and the whole court 
      of heaven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the word Mary?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies star of the sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is she properly called the star of the sea?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because she shines on us by her exemplary virtue in this 
      sea of miseries, like a most glorious star.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean you by the words, full of grace?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I mean that the Blessed Virgin hath a special fulness and 
      prerogative of grace for the conception of her Son.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, The Lord is with thee?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means that the whole Trinity was with her at the time 
      in a particular manner.</p>
      <p>[pg. 44]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How declare you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the Father was with her, as with his Spouse, the 
      Son as with his Mother, the Holy Ghost was with her, as with his choicest 
      tabernacle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are they also now with her?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are in glory, and will be so for all eternity.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Second Part of the Hail Mary.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the second part of 
      it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Blessed art thou among women, blessed is the fruit of thy 
      womb, JESUS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who made this part?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. These words, Blessed art thou among women, were first 
      delivered by the angel; and after with the rest, uttered by St. Elizabeth, 
      being inspired by the Holy Ghost. <i>Luke </i>i. 28, 42.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by Blessed art thou among women?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand, she alone was chosen out amongst all women 
      to be the Mother of God, and therefore ought to be blessed and praised by 
      all women.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why by married women?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because their children are made the sons of God by the 
      nativity and merits of her Son, of whom she daily also begs blessings for 
      them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why by virgins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because she is their queen and chiefest patroness, and 
      obtains for them of her Son <i>Jesus, </i>the gift of chastity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why by widows?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because she is their best example, and advocate to their 
      Spouse, her Son.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means, that Jesus is her true and natural Son, and in 
      him she is the author of all our blessings, and to be blessed both by men 
      and angels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are Catholics such great honourers of the name <i>
      Jesus.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. Because it is a name above all names, as you 
      have heard in the creed; and as St. Paul exhorts, saying</p>
      <p>[pg. 45]</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;all whatsoever you do in word or work, do all in the name 
      of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father by him.&quot; <i>

      <p align="center"><i>The Third Part of the Hail Mary.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the third part of 
      the <i>Hail Mary?</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Holy <i>Mary, </i>Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, 
      and in the hour of our death. Amen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who made this part?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The holy Catholic Church in the Council of <i>Ephesus, </i>
      the year of our Lord 431, (Pope <i>Celestine </i>presiding,) against 
      Nestorius, the heretic, who denied our blessed Lady to be the Mother of 
      God, and would only have her called the Mother of <i>Christ. </i>See <i>
      Baronius, </i>tom. 5. <i>An. </i>4. 31.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, Pray for us sinners now?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It means, that we need divine assistance every moment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, And at the hour of our death?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It meaneth that we then especially shall need the aid of 
      the blessed <i>Mary, </i>and her Son <i>Jesus, </i>and therefore do daily 
      beg it. The word Amen, signifies, let it be done, or be it so.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>Charity Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is Charity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the gift of God, or a supernatural quality infused 
      by God into the soul of man, by which we love God above all things, and 
      our neighbours as ourselves, for God's sake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it called supernatural?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is not in the power of nature to obtain it, but 
      by the special grace and gift of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is charity imputed as protestants would have it, or is it 
      a quality truly inherent in the soul.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is truly inherent in the soul, as wisdom is inherent in 
      a soul that is wise, and love in a soul that loves.</p>
      <p>[pg. 46]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of <i>Rom. </i>v. 5. &quot;The charity of God which 
      is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, which is given us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Dan.</i> vi, 22, &quot;Before him (i.e. God) 
      justice have been found in me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Ephes. </i>iii. 17, 18, where St. Paul 
      prays for his brethren, &quot;That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts: 
      that, being rooted and founded in charity, you may be able to comprehend, 
      with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and 
      depth.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is it to love God above all things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To be willing to lose all things, rather than the grace or 
      love of God by mortal sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who has this love?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They who keep the commandments of God, according to that, 
      &quot;This is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments; and his 
      commandments are not heavy.&quot; 1 <i>John</i> v. 3.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Hath not he charity then, that breaks any of the 
      commandments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He hath not; for &quot;he that saith, he knoweth God, and doth 
      not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.&quot; 1 <i>
      John </i>ii. 4.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is it to love our neighbours as ourselves?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To wish him as much good as we wish ourselves, and to do 
      him no wrong.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who is our neighbour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All men, women, and children, even those who injure us, or 
      differ from us in religion, but especially Catholics.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why so?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are the images of God, and redeemed with the 
      blood of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why especially Catholics?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are all members of the mystical body of 
      Christ, which is the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Whence ariseth the obligations of loving our neighbour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God hath commanded it: and 'if one shall</p>
      <p>[pg. 47]</p>
      <p>say I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar.' 1 <i>John, </i>
      iv. 20.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are we not also bound to love our enemies?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. We are, according to that, &quot;It was said of old, Thou shalt 
      not kill: but I say unto you, Love your enemies.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>v. 43, 44.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What kind of love are we bound to show to our enemies?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. We are bound to use a civil behaviour towards them, to 
      pray for them in general, and to be disposed to do any charitable office 
      for them when their necessity require it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the highest act of charity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To give our life for God's honour, and the salvation of 
      our neighbour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is charity the greatest and most excellent of virtues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is the life of all the rest. &quot;Faith without 
      charity is dead.&quot; <i>James</i> ii. 26.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What state of life do we conceive to be of greatest 
      perfection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That which of its own nature and proper institution 
      obligeth to the highest and greatest charity, for charity is perfection, 
      and such is the state not only of bishops, but also, as many probably 
      think, of pastors who have the charge of souls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>John </i>xv. 13; &quot;Greater charity than this no 
      man hath, that a man yield his life for his friends,&quot; which is the proper 
      obligation of every parish priest, according to that, &quot;The good pastor 
      giveth his life for his sheep.&quot; <i>John </i>x. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the necessity of charity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John </i>iv. 16. &quot;He that remains in charity, 
      remains in God, and God in him,&quot; and chap. iii. ver 14, &quot;He that loves 
      not, remains in death.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of charity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It destroys sin. &quot;Charity covers a multitude of sins,&quot; <i>
      James </i>v. 20, and gives spiritual life to the soul. &quot;In this we know 
      that we are translated from death to life, because we love the brethren.&quot; 
      1 <i>John </i>iii. 14.</p>

      <p align="center">&nbsp; <b>CHAP. VIII.</b></p>
      <p align="center"><i>Of the Commandments in general.</i> &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the principal aim 
      or end of the commandments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To teach us the will and pleasure of the eternal God, or 
      the love of God, and our neighbour. &quot;He that loveth his neighbour hath 
      fulfilled the law.&quot; <i>Rom. </i>xiii. 8.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the commandments (excepting the determination of 
      the sabbath day) called the commandments of the law of nature?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God wrote them in the heart of men at the 
      creation, being the very dictates of natural reason.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did he renew them in the written law?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When he gave them to <i>Moses </i>on mount <i>Sinai</i>, 
      in thunder and lightening, written in two tables of stone <i>Exod. xx.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. Why in thunder and lightening?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To move us to a careful observance of them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are all men bound to know the commandments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For the substance of them they are, because they are the 
      rule of our whole life and actions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove them to be only ten?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Deut. </i>iv. 13, &quot;He shewed his covenant which 
      he commanded you to do, and the ten words which be wrote in two tables of 
      stone.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By what kind of sins are the commandments broken?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By mortal sins only; for venial sins are not strictly 
      speaking contrary to the end of the commandments, which is charity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How declare you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because a venial sin, for example, a vain word, an 
      officious or jesting lie, which hurts nobody, the theft of a pin or an 
      apple, is not of weight enough to break charity between man and man, much 
      less between God and man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it possible for us to keep all the commandments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not only possible, but necessary and easy, by the 
      assistance of God's grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God is not a tyrant to command impos-</p>
      <p>[pg. 49]</p>
      <p>sibilities under pain of eternal damnation, as he doth the keeping his 
      commandments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of <i>Exod. </i>xx. and <i>Deut. </i>xxviii. 15. 
      where he often commands them to be kept,<br>
      threatening grievous punishments to such as break them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Matt. </i>v. 19. &quot;Whosoever, therefore, 
      shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he 
      shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do 
      and teach the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Matt. </i>xi. 29, 30. &quot;Take up my yoke 
      upon you (saith the Lord) for my yoke is sweet, and my burden light.&quot; And 
      again, 1 <i>John </i>v. 3. &quot;His commandments are not heavy.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Hath God ever promised to enable man to keep them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He hath, and also actually to make them keep and do them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Ezek.</i> xxxvi. 27. &quot;I will put my spirit in 
      the middle of you, (said our Lord) and I will make ye walk in my precepts, 
      and keep my judgments and do them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again, chap. xxxvii. 23, 24. &quot;They shall be my people, 
      and I will be their God, there shall be one pastor of them all, and they 
      shall walk in my judgments and keep my commandments and do them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove that any have kept them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Luke </i>i. 6. &quot;<i>Zachary </i>and <i>Elizabeth</i> 
      were both just before God: walking in all the commandments and 
      justifications of our Lord without reproof.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the keeping of them to be necessary to 
      salvation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Matt.</i> xix. 17. &quot;If thou wilt enter 
      into life (saith our Lord) keep the commandments.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Luke </i>x. 25, 28, where the lawyer had 
      asked, what he should do to possess everlasting life, and had repeated the 
      sum of the commandments: Christ answered him saying, &quot;Do this, and thou 
      shalt live.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 50]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Rom. </i>ii. 13, &quot;Not hearers of 
      the law are just with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.&quot;</p>

      <p align="center">OF THE COMMANDMENTS IN PARTICULAR.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The First Commandment Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the first 
      commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of 
      Egypt, and out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt not have strange gods 
      before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness 
      of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth below, or of those 
      things that are in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not adore nor 
      worship them; I am the Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the sins of 
      the fathers upon their children, to the third and fourth generation of 
      them that hate me; and showing mercy to thousands of those that love me, 
      and keep my commandments. <i>Exod. </i>xx.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are we commanded by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To serve, love, adore, and worship one only, true, living, 
      and eternal God, and no more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are we forbidden by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not to worship any creature for a God, or give to it the 
      honour which is due to God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the honour due to God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A supreme and sovereign honour, which is called by divines
      <i>Latria</i>; by which we honour him as the great master of life and 
      death, as our creator, redeemer, preserver, and last end.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do men sin against this commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By worshipping idols and false gods, by erring or doubting 
      in faith, by superstition and witchcraft.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By communicating with infidels or heretics, by believing 
      dreams, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it a great sin to go to church with 
      heretics?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because by so doing we outwardly deny our faith, and 
      profess their false faith.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What scripture have you against it?</p>
      <p>[pg. 51]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Luke</i> xvii. 23, 24, where Christ 
      forbids it, saying, &quot;And they shall say unto you, Lo! here is Christ, Lo, 
      there Christ; go ye not, neither do you follow them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Tit.</i> iii. 10, 11. &quot;A man that is a heretic, 
      after the first and second admonition, avoid, knowing that he that is such 
      an one is subverted and sinneth.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it unlawful to go to witches and 
      fortune-tellers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Deut. </i>xviii.<i> </i>10, 11. &quot;There shall not 
      be found among you any one that shall expiate his son or daughter making 
      them to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or any observer 
      of times, or enchanter, or witch, or a charmer, or a wizard, or 
      necromancer, &amp;c. For all these things our Lord abhorreth.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by these words. Thou shalt not make to 
      thyself any graven thing, &amp;c. Thou shalt not adore them, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand that we must not make idols or images, nor 
      any graven thing whatsoever, to adore it as a god, or with God's honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are not these words expressed at length in many of our 
      short catechisms?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are sufficiently included in the preceding 
      words, &quot;Thou shalt not have strange (or other) gods before me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How declare you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because if we must have no other but the only true God, 
      who created heaven and earth, then it is clear to the reason of every 
      child, that we must not have many gods, or any graven things for gods, or 
      adore any other things for God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do Protestants of those of new religions, instead of 
      graven things, translate graven images?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they have a will to corrupt the text, in hope by 
      so doing to persuade ignorant people, that Catholics are idolaters, and 
      break the first commandment by making and worshipping images.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove they corrupt the text?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the <i>Hebrew</i> word is <i>Pesel, </i>which 
      signifies a graven thing, the <i>Greek&nbsp;</i> is <i>Idolon, </i>and the</p>
      <p>[pg. 52]</p>
      <p><i>Latin </i>is <i>Sculptile, </i>a graven thing; therefore the word <i>
      Image</i> is a mere corruption.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful then to give any honour to the images of <i>
      Christ </i>and his saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, an inferior or relative honour, as much as they 
      represent unto us heavenly things, but not God's honour, nor yet the 
      honour due the saints.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Exod. </i>xxv. 18, 19, 22, where God himself 
      commanded &quot;two cherubims to be made of beaten gold, and to be set on both 
      sides of the ark (before which the people were to pray) and promised that 
      he would speak unto them from the middle of the cherubims;&quot; therefore it 
      is lawful to make images and pray before them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Do not Catholics pray to images and relics?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By no means; we pray before them, indeed, to excite our 
      devotion, and to keep our thoughts collected upon heavenly subjects; but 
      we do not, at all, pray to them; for we know well they can neither see, 
      nor hear, nor help us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you for the lawful use of images?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>John </i>iii. 14, where Christ approves 
      the making and exalting the brazen serpent, by which the <i>Israelites</i> 
      were healed in the desert, and owns it to be an image or figure of 
      himself, exalted on the cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because we read in <i>Baronius</i>, that the famous 
      church historian, in the year of Christ, 31, that <i>Christ</i> himself 
      sent his own image to king <i>Abdagar,&nbsp;</i> and made it also by the 
      miracle on the handkerchief of St. <i>Veronica, </i>and on his own shroud.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to this, the second <i>Nicene</i> council, Actio 4, 
      anathematizes image-breakers, that is such as shall break them in contempt 
      or scorn, and all such as allege the places in scripture, which are 
      against idols, are against the sacred images; and also those who say that 
      Catholics honour images as God, with sovereign honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How could you further satisfy a Protestant, that should 
      charge you with idolatry, in giving sovereign honour to pictures and 
      images?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I would for satisfaction herein, if necessary, break</p>
      <p>[pg. 53]</p>
      <p>a crucifix, or tear a picture of <i>Jesus Christ </i>in pieces, and 
      throw the pieces into the fire; and would show him the council of <i>
      Trent,</i> Sess. 25, which teaches thus, &quot;Images are not to be venerated 
      for any virtue of divinity that is believed to be in them, or for any 
      trust or confidence that is to be put in them, as the <i>Gentiles</i> did 
      of old, who reposed their hope and trust in their idols; but because the 
      honour that is exhibited to them, is referred to the prototypes 
      represented by them&quot; &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What benefits do we receive by images?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Very great, because they movingly represent to us the 
      mysteries of our Saviour's passion, as also by martyrdoms and examples of 
      his saints.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there not some danger of Idolatry in the frequent use 
      of idols?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Truely none at all; for it is not possible that any 
      rational man, who is instructed in Christianity, would conceive or think a 
      piece of painted wood or marble, is that God and man, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, 
      who was born of the Virgin Mary, died on the cross, arose from the dead, 
      ascended into heaven, and sits now on the right hand of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. But how, if such inconveniences happen, at least by 
      accident?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Let the abuse be mended, and not the good institution 
      taken away or blamed; For man's nature is subject to hurt itself, even in 
      the best things, which must not therefore be given over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it lawful to paint God the Father like an 
      old man, seeing he is pure spirit, and hath no body?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because he appeared to the prophet <i>Daniel</i> in the 
      shape of an old man, <i>Dan. </i>7, but this is to be understood, that the 
      pictures we make, are not the proper images of God the Father, but the 
      shape wherein he appeared to <i>Daniel. </i>And the like is to be 
      understood of the pictures of angels, to wit, that they are not proper 
      images of them, according to their spiritual substance, but of the shape 
      they appear in to men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What utility doth accrue to us by our honouring and 
      canonizing Saints?</p>
      <p>[pg. 54]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Very great, seeing it much conduceth to the 
      imitation of their virtues, and the love of God, making us know that it is 
      possible even for ourselves, to come to the like reward.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How declare you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the higher esteem we have of the saints, and the 
      excellency of their state, the more ardent must needs be our desire, and 
      the stronger our courage, to do and undertake what they did and practised.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful to honour the angels and saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is with <i>Dulia, </i>an inferior honour, proportioned 
      to their excellency, which they have from God; it is God we honour in 
      them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Josue </i>v. 14, where the angel of the 
      Lord said to Josue, &quot;I am the prince of the host of our Lord.&quot; Josue fell 
      on his face to the ground; and worshipping said, &quot;What saith my Lord to 
      his servant?'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Apoc.</i> xxii. 8, where John (though the 
      angel had already forbidden him so to do, because of his apostolical 
      dignity, chap xix. 10.) &quot;fell down to adore before the feet of the angel, 
      who shewed him these things.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful to honour the relics of saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. With a relative honour it is, referring it to God's 
      honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, because a dead man was raised from death to life by 
      touching the bones of <em>Eliseus</em><i> </i>the prophet, 4 <i>Kings</i> 
      xiii. 21.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Matt.</i> ix. 20, 21, where we read the 
      woman was healed of her bloody flux, but by the touching the hem of our 
      Saviour's garment, and believing it would heal her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Acts</i> xviii. 19. &quot;The handkerchiefs and 
      aprons which had but touched the body of St. Paul, cast out devils, and 
      cured all diseases.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that dead and inanimate things, (for 
      example, medals, crosses, churches, bread, water and the like) are capable 
      of sanctity and honour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Joshua </i>iv. 16, and <i>Exod. </i>iii. 
      5, where</p>
      <p>[pg. 55]</p>
      <p>the Angel saith to <i>Moses </i>and <i>Joshua</i>, &quot;Loose thy shoes 
      from 'thy feet, for the ground whereon thou standest is holy ground.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Matt. </i>xxiii. 17, 18, where we read, 
      that the temple sanctifieth the gold, and the altar the gift. &quot;Ye fools 
      and blind, (saith our Lord,) whether is greater, the gold, or the temple 
      that sanctifieth the gold? the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the 
      gift?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Tim. </i>iv. 4, 5. &quot;Every creature of God 
      is sanctified by the word of God and prayer,&quot; and out of 2 <i>Peter</i> i. 
      18, where he calls the mountain <i>Tabor</i> a holy hill, because Christ 
      was transfigured upon it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that pilgrimages to holy places, as to mount
      <i>Calvary</i>, mount <i>Tabor</i>, and the sepulchre of <i>Christ</i>, 
      are laudable and pious practices?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Deut.</i> xvi. 16, where God himself 
      commanded, that thrice a year all the people should come up into <i>
      Jerusalem</i>, to adore and make their offerings to him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the example of <i>Christ</i> himself, our blessed 
      Lady, and St. Joseph, &quot;who went up to <i>Jerusalem, </i>the solemn day of 
      the <i>Pasch.</i>&quot; <i>Luke </i>ii. 41, 42.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Acts </i>viii. where the <i>Ethiopian</i> 
      eunuch, going on a pilgrimage to <i>Jerusalem</i>, was in his return 
      converted and baptized by St. Philip, so pleasing was his pilgrimage to 
      God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, because it was foretold by the prophets that these 
      places which <i>Christ</i> sanctified by his passion should be of great 
      pilgrimage and adoration, &quot;We will adore (saith <i>David</i>) in the place 
      where his feet stood,&quot; <i>Psalm </i>cxxxi. 7. And in <i>Isa. </i>xi. 10, 
      we read, &quot;To him shall the Gentiles pray, and his sepulchre shall be 
      glorious.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it lawful to go on pilgrimages to the 
      shrines of Saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because, as you have read already, their relics are holy 
      and venerable things, and God is pleased to work great cures and miracles 
      by them for such as are devout honourers of them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. If there any power now in the church to do miracles?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is according to that unlimited promise of</p>
      <p>[pg. 56]</p>
      <p align="left">Christ. &quot;And these signs shall follow them that believe: 
      In my name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues: 
      they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover.&quot; <i>Mark
      </i>xvi. 17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Have these things been done in latter ages?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They have, and are, as you may see in the unquestioned 
      histories and records of all Catholic countries; where many great miracles 
      wrought by the servants of God, especially at pilgrimages and shrines of 
      Saints, are yearly registered under the depositions of eye-witnesses, men 
      above all exceptions, which cannot be denied unless we deny all history.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do the pretended reformers say miracles are ceased?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they have never yet been able to do any in 
      confirmation of their errors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are so few done here in our days?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By reason of incredulity of many bad Christians. <i>Matt.
      </i>xiii. 58.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What necessity is there for the belief of miracles?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Doubtless very great; because the belief of miracles well 
      grounded, make men extremely apprehensive of the presence of God, and his 
      immediate government of human affairs; so that he who absolutely denies 
      miracles, is to be suspected of not believing particular providence, which 
      is the main string on which all Christianity depends.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Second Commandment Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the second 
      commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord by God in vain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is forbidden by this precept.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All false, rash, and unnecessary oaths.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What kind of sins are false and rash oaths?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Mortal sins, if they be voluntary and deliberate, because 
      by such oaths, we call God to witness a lie; or at least to that which is 
      uncertain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the necessary conditions of a lawful oath?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Truth, </i>that we hurt not God's honour; <i>justice</i></p>
      <p>[pg. 57]</p>
      <p align="left">that we wrong not our neighbour; and <i>judgment, </i>that 
      we swear not vainly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the just cause of an oath?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. God's honour, our own, or our neighbour's good and defence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. If a man swears to do that which is evil, is he bound to 
      keep his oath?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, he is not bound to keep it; for an oath is no bond of 
      iniquity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you a vain or jesting oath to be a sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>v. 33. &quot;It was said of old (saith our 
      Lord) Thou shalt not commit perjury; but I say unto you, not to swear at 
      all,&quot; that is without just cause.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>James&nbsp;</i> v. 12. &quot;But above all things, my 
      brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other 
      oath. But let your speech be: Yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under 
      judgment.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else is prohibited by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All cursing and blaspheming.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How else do men sin against this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By breaking lawful vows, and by making or keeping unlawful 
      ones.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is a lawful vow?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a deliberate and voluntary promise made to God, of 
      some better good.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it lawful to make vows?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Isa.&nbsp;</i> xix. 21. &quot;They shall make vows unto 
      the Lord, and shall pay them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is commanded by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To speak always with reverence of God, and his saints.</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="command 3"></a></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp; <i>The Third Commandment Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the third 
      commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Remember that thou keepest holy the sabbath day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did the Sabbath begin to be kept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From the very creation of the world; for then God blessed 
      the seventh day, and rested on it from all His works. <i>Gen</i>. ii. 2.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When was this commandment renewed?</p>
      <p>[pg. 58]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the Old Law; when God gave the commandments to
      <i>Moses</i> on mount <i>Sinai</i>, written with His own finger in two 
      tables of stone, <i>Exod</i>. xx. 1, &amp;c. xxxi. 18.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was the <i>Jewish</i> Sabbath changed into the <i>
      Sunday</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because <i>Christ</i> was born upon a <i>Sunday</i>, arose 
      from the dead upon a <i>Sunday</i>, and sent down the Holy Ghost on a <i>
      Sunday: </i>works not inferior to the creation of the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By whom was it changed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the Governors of the Church, the Apostles, who also 
      kept it; for St. John was in spirit on the Lords day (which was Sunday.)
      <i>Apoc</i>. i. 10.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the Church hath power to command feasts 
      and holydays?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the very act of changing the sabbath into <i>Sunday</i>, 
      which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict 
      themselves, by keeping <i>Sunday</i> strictly, and breaking most other 
      feasts commanded by the same Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because by keeping <i>Sunday</i>, they acknowledge the 
      Church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin; and by not 
      keeping the rest by her commanded, they again deny, in fact, the same 
      power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John </i>x. 22, where we read that <i>Christ </i>
      himself was present, and kept the Dedication of the temple in <i>Jerusalem</i>, 
      a feast ordained by <i>Judas Maccabæus, </i>1 <i>Macc. </i>iv. 59.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And out of <i>Acts</i> ii. 1, 4, where the Apostles, keeping 
      the feast of <i>Pentecost</i>, &quot;were all filled with the Holy Ghost.&quot; 
      Neither do Protestants as yet differ from this, though some have lately 
      prohibited and profaned both it and the holy feast of the Resurrection, 
      and all the other feasts of the Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What commandment have you from God for obedience to the 
      Church in things of this nature?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Acts</i> xv. 41, where we read that &quot;St. Paul 
      went about confirming the Churches, and commanding them to keep the 
      precepts of the Apostles and the an-</p>
      <p>[pg. 59]</p>
      <p>cients.&quot; And out of <i>Luke </i>x. 16, &quot;He that heareth you, heareth 
      me; and he that despiseth you (the Church) despiseth me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. May temporal princes and the laity make a holy day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. With consent and approbation of the Church, they may, 
      otherwise not; because this is an act of spiritual jurisdiction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end doth the Church ordain holydays?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For the increase of piety, and the memory of special 
      benefits received from God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. If keeping the <i>Sunday</i> be a church precept, why is 
      it numbered in the decalogue, which are the Commandments of God, and the 
      Law of Nature?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the substance or chief part of it, namely Divine 
      Right, and the Law of Nature; though the determinating this particular 
      day, <i>Sunday </i>rather than <i>Saturday</i>, be a Church ordinance and 
      precept.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Did not <i>Christ</i>, when he confirmed the rest, confirm 
      also this commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In as much as it belongeth to the law of nature, he did: 
      but not as it belonged to the ceremonial law of the <i>Jews, </i>and was 
      affixed to <i>Saturday, </i>therefore, now we are not bound to keep <i>
      Saturday.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. Why so, I pray you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because that particular day was a command of the 
      ceremonial law of the <i>Jews, </i>which was abrogated, and ceased to 
      oblige after the death of <i>Christ</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. To what are we obliged by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To spend <i>Sunday</i> in prayer and divine service.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the best means to sanctify the <i>Sunday</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By hearing mass, confessing our sins, communicating, 
      hearing sermons, and reading good books.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is forbidden by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All profane employments, and servile labours, excepting 
      such as are of necessity, as dressing meat, serving cattle, &amp;c. or such as 
      appertain to piety and works of mercy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who break this commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Such as without necessity spend any considerable part of 
      the <i>Sunday</i> in servile labours.</p>
      <p>[pg. 60]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How else is the <i>Sunday </i>profaned?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By spending all the morning slothfully in bed, or vainly 
      dressing ourselves; by missing divine service when we may hear it, or 
      spending a part of the day in drinking, gaming, dancing, or the like.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any thing now in this first table of the law 
      impossible to be observed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No certainly; for nothing can be more easy and delightful 
      to the true servant of God, than the things that are here commanded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do you now divide the table of Moral law into three 
      and seven, whereas anciently some Fathers assigned four to the first 
      table, and six to the last?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Concerning the manner of limiting the number of 
      commandments to each table, the scripture says nothing, not so much as 
      which is the third, which is the fourth commandment, and therefore it is 
      in itself indifferent: St. Jerome divides them into four and six, which is 
      no where condemned, St. Augustine into three and seven, who is more 
      generally followed; but indeed the matter is of no great importance how we 
      reckon them so we retain them in our books, and keep them in our lives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. But what reason can justify the omission of so great a 
      part of the text, when we transcribe the commandments into our catechisms?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Such books being composed principally for the unlearned, 
      are by the pastors of the church abridged into the shortest and easiest 
      method they can, prudently condescending to the weak memories and low 
      capacities of the people: nor can the church be accused of the least 
      shadow of corrupting or omitting any part of the commandments, or of God's 
      word; since in no Catholic Bible is there one syllable left out; and 
      whether the first commandment, after this account, be divided, and the two 
      last united, or contrawise the last divided and the first united, is not 
      at all material, the whole ten commandments being entirely contained in 
      both, or either way.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>The Fourth Commandment Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the fourth 
      commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Honour thy father and mother.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are we commanded by this precept.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To love, reverence, obey, and relieve our parents in their 
      wants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why to love them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because, under God they are the chief causes of our very 
      life and being; and do not only bring us up with much love, labour, and 
      solicitude.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How are we bound to reverence them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not only inwardly in our heart, but also outwardly in our 
      carriage and comportment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why to obey them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are God's vicegerents, and have received 
      power from him (from whom is all paternity in heaven and earth) both to 
      direct us, instruct us, and correct us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what things are we bound to obey our parents?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In all that is not sin, according to that, &quot;Children obey 
      your parents in all things, for that is pleasing unto God.&quot; <i>Col. </i>
      iii. 20.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is prohibited by the precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All sourness, stubborness, and disobedience to parents.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the reward of dutiful children?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Long and happy life; &quot;The blessing of heaven comes upon 
      them, and remains to the end of their days.&quot; <i>Eccl. </i>iii. 10.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the reward of undutiful children?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A short and sinful life, accompanied with an untimely 
      death witness the example of <i>Absalom,</i><br>
      2 <i>Kings </i>viii. 14.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That of <i>Prov. </i>xxx. 17. &quot;The eye that mocketh at his 
      father, and that despiseth the travail of his mother in bearing him, let 
      the ravens of the torrent pick it out and the young of the eagle eat it.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 62]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the word Father?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies not only our corporal parents, but also our 
      Ghostly Father, and all lawful superiors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What owe we to the Ghostly Father?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Love, reverence, obedience, and maintenance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why love?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are the fathers and feeders of our souls, and 
      under God and his saints, the instrumental causes of our spiritual good: 
      &quot;For in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel,&quot; (saith St. 
      Paul) 1 <i>Cor. </i>iv. 15.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why reverence?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are God's anointed, and represent the person 
      of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why obedience?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because God hath appointed them to be our spiritual 
      pastors, guides, and governors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what are we bound to obey them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In all things belonging to faith, doctrine, and the 
      government of our souls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is any great honour due to priests and ghostly fathers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is, according to that of St. Paul. &quot;Let the priests 
      who rule well be esteemed worthy of double honour; especially they who 
      labour in the word and doctrine.&quot; 1 <i>Tim. </i>v. 17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Have you any other place?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, <i>Eccle. </i>vii. 13, 32, 33, &quot;With all thy soul 
      fear our Lord and reverence his priests, with all thy strength, love them 
      that made thee and forsake not his master, honour God with all thy soul, 
      and honour the priests.&quot; And the reason is, for if we owe love, honour, 
      and obedience to our carnal parents, much more to our spiritual, by how 
      much the soul surpasseth the body. Again, as there is none greater than 
      priests, who are empowered to shut and open the gates of heaven, as also 
      to convert the substance of bread and wine, into the most precious body 
      and blood of our blessed Saviour: to no person is greater honour due, than 
      to them who personate Christ himself, so that he who despiseth them 
      despiseth Christ himself, and the disregard of them is the origin of 
      impiety.</p>
      <p>[pg. 63]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How may we sin against priests and ghostly 
      fathers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By disobeying or detracting them, or believing slanderous 
      reports against them, upon mere hearsay, or the testimony of insufficient 
      witnesses, or without witnesses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What testimony is sufficient against a priest?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I will tell you out of St. Paul's mouth: &quot;Against a priest 
      (saith he to <i>Timothy</i> the bishop of <i>Ephesus</i>) receive not an 
      accusation under two or three witnesses.&quot; 1 <i>Tim. </i>v. 19, and 21, &quot;I 
      charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou 
      observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to 
      either side.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it convenient to ask a blessing of priests?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, because they give it in the name and person of 
      Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What warrant have you for it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of <i>Mark 14, 16, </i>where &quot;Christ laying his 
      hands upon the children, blessed them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the example of <i>Melchisedech </i>blessing <i>
      Abraham</i>; upon which St. Paul saith, &quot;without all contradiction, that 
      which is less, is blessed of the better.&quot; <i>Heb. </i>vii. 7.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What scripture have you for obedience to priests?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Heb.&nbsp;</i> xiii. 17. &quot;Obey your prelates, and be subject 
      to them; for they watch, as being to render an account for your souls.&quot; 
      And in the old law, disobedience to the priests was punished with death,<br>
      <i>Deut. </i>xvii. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what are we bound under sin to obey princes and 
      temporal magistrates?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In all things (which are not sin) belonging to the good 
      and peace of the commonwealth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Rom. </i>xiii. 1. &quot;Let every soul be 
      subject to the higher powers, for there is no power but of God: he 
      therefore that resists power, resists the ordinance of God.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of 1 <i>Pet. </i>ii. 13, 14. &quot;Be ye subject to 
      every creature for God, whether to the king as ex-</p>
      <p>[pg. 64]</p>
      <p align="left">celling, or to magistrates, as sent by him to the revenge 
      of malefactors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if kings or magistrates command us to do sin, or 
      things against our conscience?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Then we must answer them with the apostles, 'we must obey 
      God, rather than men.&quot; Acts v. 29.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what are servants bound to obey their masters?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In all things that are not sin, belonging to their charge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Coloss</i>. iii. 22. &quot;Servants, obey in all 
      things your masters, according to the flesh, not serving the eye, as 
      pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, as pleasing God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do servants sin against their masters?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By neglecting their commands, stealing or spoiling their 
      goods, &amp;c.</p>

      quarreling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it not lawful to kill in any cause?<br>

      &quot;For the magistrate beareth not the sword without cause.&quot; <i>Rom.</i> i. 
      4. As also in the blameless defence of our own, or our innocent 
      neighbour's life, against an unjust invader.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful to fight duels, appointing a set time and 
      place, for private interest, or punctilios of honour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, by no means; for the church hath forbidden it under 
      excommunication, to be incurred <i>ipso facto;&nbsp;</i> and such as die in 
      duels, can be neither have Christian burial nor be prayed for the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you all fighting and quarreling to be unlawful?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>v. 39. &quot;You have heard (saith Christ) 
      it was said of old, and eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; but I say 
      unto you not to resist evil, but if</p>

      the other.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else is forbidden by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To seek, wish, or desire our own, or any other man's 
      death, out of impatience or passion, or to cause women with child to 
      miscarry.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All carnal sin with another man's wife, or another woman's 
      husband, and chiefly adultery; as also fornication and pollution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you fornication and pollution to be mortal sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Col. </i>iii. 5, 6. &quot;Mortify, therefore, (saith 
      St. Paul,) your members, which are upon earth: fornication, uncleaness, 
      lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols: 
      for which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what case is it lawful for a man to dismiss his wife?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Only in case of evident adultery.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can he that hath so dismissed his wife, marry another 
      during her life?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He cannot; for &quot;he that dismisseth his wife and marries 
      another, committeth adultery.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>v. 32. And <i>Luke&nbsp;</i> xvi. 
      18. &quot;He that marries her, that is so dismissed, commits adultery.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is adultery a far greater sin than fornication?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is a greater injury to our innocent neighbour, 
      as also to the sacrament of matrimony.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that a wife so dismissed from her husband, 
      cannot marry again during her husband's life?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>vii. 10, 11. &quot;But to them, that are 
      married, not I, but the Lord commandeth, that the wife depart not from her 
      husband: and if she depart, that she remain unmarried.&quot; And ver. 39.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Whoredom, incest, sacrilege, and sins against nature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is lust hateful in the sight of God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it defiles in us the image of God, and the temple 
      of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What more is here prohibited?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Unchaste touching of ourselves or others, with delight in

      commandment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Thou shalt not steal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is forbidden by this precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All unjust taking away, or detaining that which is another 
      man's.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How many kinds of theft be there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Three kinds, simple theft, which is a secret taking away 
      that which is another man's; rapine, which is a taking away by open 
      violence, or keeping of that which is another man's; and sacrilege, which 
      is stealing of sacred things, or out of sacred places.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When is theft a mortal sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When the thing stolen is of a considerable value, or 
      causeth a considerable hurt to our neighbour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>vi. 10. &quot;Neither thieves, nor

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What doth the sin of theft oblige us to?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else is here prohibited?<br>

      <p>[pg. 67]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is usury?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is to receive, or to hope for some money or moneys' 
      worth, as gain, above the principle, immediately out of the consideration 
      of loan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you usury and bribery to great sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Psalm</i> xiv. 1, 6. &quot;O Lord, who shall dwell in 
      thy tabernacle, or who shall rest in thy holy mountain? He that have not 
      given his money to use, nor taken bribes upon the innocent man.&quot; And from
      <i>Ezek. </i>xxii 12. &quot;Thou hast taken usury and increase, and hast 
      covetously oppressed thy neighbours. I will disperse thee in the nations, 
      and will scatter thee among the countries.&quot; Likewise from <i>Luke </i>vi.

      sellers, by deceitful weight and measure, or by exceeding the just prices: 
      masters by defrauding servants of their wages: and servants, by embezzling 
      their master's goods. &quot;And that no man over-reach or deceive his brother 
      in business: because the Lord is the avenger of all such things, as we

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. All false testimonials, rash judgment, and lies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is false testimony so great a sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is against the justice of God, and our 
      neighbour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that corrupt judgment is a great sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Isa. </i>v. 22, 23, 24. &quot;Wo be to you that call 
      evil good, that justify the impious man for bribes</p>
      <p>[pg. 68]</p>
      <p>and rob the just man of his justice; for as fire devoureth the stubble, 
      so shall the root of these men be ashes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is rash judgment a great sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it robs God of his judgment, and our neighbour of 
      his good name: &quot;Do not ye judge, that you be not judged.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>
      vii. 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it a sin to lie?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because &quot;the devil is a liar, and the father of all lies.&quot;
      <i>John </i>viii. 44.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else is prohibited by the precept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The crimes of whispering, flattery, detraction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is whispering?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is to break friendship between others, by speaking ill 
      of one unto the other behind his back.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is flattery?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. to attribute to another some perfection which he hath not, 
      or to praise him for that which he deserves not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is detraction?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Is is a secret staining and blotting another's good name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is calumny?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is telling a falsehood of our neighbour to his 
      prejudice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Are lies, backbiting, flattery, afronts, detraction, and 
      calumny, grievous sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are often very grievous sins. The scriptures saith,
      <i>Prov. </i>vi. 16, 19. &quot;Six things there are which the Lord hateth; and 
      the seventh his soul destesteth. Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that 
      shed innocent blood, a heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are 
      swift to run into mischief, a deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and 
      him that soweth discord among the brethren.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is he bound to, that hath hurt his neighbour in any 
      of these kinds?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To make him satisfaction, and restore him his good name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How for example?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. If he have told a hurtful lie of him, he is bound to unsay 
      it; or if he have revealed his secret sin, he is bound to speak well of 
      the same party, and to mitigate the matter as well as he can.</p>
      <p>[pg. 69]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it a sin to hearken to 
      detraction?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To do it willingly, and with delight, or so as to 
      encourage the detractor, it is; for by so doing we cooperate with the 
      detractor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How them must we behave ourselves among detractors?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. If they be inferiors, we must reprehend them; if equals or 
      superiors, we must show ourselves at least not pleased with that 
      discourse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is rash judgment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That which is grounded on mere hearsay, jealousy, and 
      surmises without any moral certainty, or great probability.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When is a lie a mortal sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When it is any great dishonour to God or notable prejudice 
      to our neighbour: otherwise, if it be merely officious, or trifling, it is 
      but a venial sin.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT are the ninth and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, Thou shalt not 
      covet thy neighbour's goods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is prohibited by these commandments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The inordinate will or desire of unlawful lust, especially 
      adultery, and of all these.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not only deliberate desire or consent, but likewise all 
      voluntary delight and complacency, in covetous or impure thoughts and 
      motions of the flesh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that unchaste desires are mortal sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>v. 27, 28. &quot;It was said of old, Thou 
      shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, whosoever shall see a woman 
      to lust after her, he hath already committed adultery in his heart.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you covetous desires to be great sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Tim. </i>vi. 9. &quot;For they who would become 
      rich, fall into temptation, and into the snare of the devil, and into many 
      unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men in destruction and 
      perdition.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any sin in those motions of concupiscence, which 
      we feel an suffer against our wills?</p>
      <p>[pg. 70]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is not, for nothing is sin, which is not 
      voluntary and deliberate. Nay, if resisted they become the occasion of 
      merit to us. To them were liable the most perfect saints, and even the 
      apostles themselves; for Paul, 2 <i>Cor. </i>xii. 7, 8, 9, writes, &quot;And 
      lest the greatness of the revelations should puff me up, there was given 
      me a sting of my flesh, and angel of Satan, to buffet me. For which thing 
      I thrice besought the Lord, that it might depart from me: And he said to 
      me: My grace is sufficient for thee: for power is made perfect in 
      infirmity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What think you now of this second table of the law, is 
      there any thing that favours of impossibility?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No certainly, for there is nothing commanded us, which the 
      very law of nature and right reason doth not dictate to us; and therefore 
      ought to be observed and done, although it were not commanded us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any thing but what every man expects and desires 
      to have done to himself by others?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is not, therefore we must do the same to others, 
      according to that, &quot;All things whatsoever you will that men do unto you, 
      do ye also to them; for this is the law and the prophets.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>
      vii. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then do Protestants pretend and say, that the 
      commandments are impossible to be kept?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are not willing to oblige themselves to the 
      observance of them, but had rather make God the author of sin, by 
      commanding impossibilities, (a most high blasphemy) and justify their own 
      iniquities by saying, they cannot help it; than humbly acknowledge and 
      confess their sins, with purpose to amend, by an acceptance of the law of 
      God.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In memory that the same Christ, who is offered upon the

      down the Holy Ghost on a <i>Sunday</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why on all holydays?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Either in memory of some special benefit, or else for a 
      commemoration of some peculiar saint, so to move ourselves to imitate his 
      example.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the church hath power to ordain and 
      command feasts?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, by the example of the church in the apostle's time, 
      which ordained the feast of Christmas in honour of the Nativity of Christ; 
      Easter in honour of his resurrection; Whitsuntide, in honour of the coming 
      of the Holy Ghost, in tongues of fire.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of St. Clement, the disciple of St. Peter, in 
      his eighth book of apostolical constitutions, where he witnesseth. &quot;That 
      the apostles gave order for the celebrating of St. Stephen's and some 
      other of their fellow apostles' days after their deaths.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of 2 <i>Thess. </i>iii. 4. &quot;And we have 
      confidence concerning you in the Lord, that the things which we command, 
      you both do, and will do.&quot; And ver. 14. &quot;And if any man obey not our word 
      by <i>this </i>epistle, note that man, and do not keep company with him, 
      he may be ashamed.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, out of 1 <i>Thess.</i> iv. 8, where St. Paul, 
      (speaking of the precepts he had given his brethren,) saith, &quot;He that 
      despiseth these things, despiseth not man, but God, who also hath given 
      his Holy Spirit in us.&quot; See what was said before in the third commandment 
      of God.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Second Precept of the Church Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the second commandment 
      of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To fast Lent, Vigils commanded, Ember days,</p>
      <p>[pg. 72]</p>
      <p>and with abstinence from flesh on Fridays and Saturdays.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why Lent?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In imitation of Christ our Lord, who fasted forty days and 
      forty nights in the desert for our sins, without once eating or drinking.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can we fast in this manner?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. We cannot; but we must do at least what we are able.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you fasting to be a pious practice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the example of Christ and his Saints, and out of <i>
      Luke</i> ii. 37, where we read, &quot;That <i>Anna</i> the prophetess departed 
      not from the temple serving day and night by fasting and prayer.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you fasting to me meritorious?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>vi. 16, 17, 18. &quot;And when you fast, be 
      not sad, like the hypocrites; but anoint thy head, and wash thy face, that 
      thou appear not unto men to fast, but to thy Father which is in secret, 
      and thy Father who seeth in secret, will repay thee.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you abstinence from certain meats to be 
      commendable?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it was proscribed by an angel to St. John. &quot;He 
      shall be great before the Lord, wine and cider he shall not drink.&quot; <i>
      Luke </i>i. 15. And in <i>Matt.</i> iii. 4, we read, &quot;That his food was 
      locusts and wild honey.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what is fasting available?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For the remission of sins and appeasing the wrath of God, 
      according to that, &quot;Be ye converted unto me in your whole heart, in 
      fasting, weeping, and mourning,&quot; <i>Joel </i>ii. 12.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To mortify all the lustful desires of the flesh; and that it 
      hath special force against the Devil: &quot;This kind of devil (saith our Lord) 
      can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting,&quot; <i>Mark </i>ix. 29.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why Vigils?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To prepare ourselves for a devout keeping the feasts that 
      follow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why Ember-days?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because on those days the church giveth Holy orders and 
      ordained priests; and for that cause hath dedicated them to public prayers 
      and fasting.</p>
      <p>[pg. 73]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What ground have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Acts </i>xiii. 2, 3. &quot;And as they (the apostles) 
      were ministering to our Lord, and fasting, the Holy Ghost said, Separate 
      ye unto me Saul and Barnabas to the work whereto I have them. Then with 
      fasting and praying, and imposing hand on them, they dismissed them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why abstinence on Fridays?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In memory that Christ suffered for us upon a Friday; 
      drinking gall and vinegar on the cross; but especially by custom, which is 
      a good as law.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why abstinence on Saturdays?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To prepare ourselves for a devout keeping of the Sunday, 
      as also in honour of the blessed Virgin Mary, who stood firm in faith on 
      that day, the apostles themselves wavering.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Third Precept of the Church Expounded.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      third commandment of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To confess our sins at least once a year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was that commanded?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because otherwise, libertines would not have done it once 
      in many years.</p>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      fourth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To receive the blessed Sacrament at least once a year, and 
      that at Easter, or thereabouts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why at Easter?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because Christ instituted the blessed Sacrament of the 
      Eucharist at his last supper, the Thursday before Easter day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What said it, or thereabouts?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it will satisfy the precept, if it be done at any 
      time between Palm Sunday and Low-Sunday.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Fifth Precept of the Church Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the fifth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To pay tithes to our pastors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why so?</p>
      <p>[pg. 74]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because as they feed us spiritually, 
      it is fit we should feed them corporally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Gal. </i>vi. 6. Let him that is catechised in 
      the word communicate to him that catechised him, in all his goods. And 1
      <i>Cor. </i>ix. 13, 14. They that serve the altar participate with the 
      altar, and so the Lord ordained that they who preach the gospel should 
      live by the gospel.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Sixth Precept of the Church Expounded.</i></p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the sixth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not to solemnize marriage on times prohibited that is, 
      from the first Sunday of Advent, until Twelfth day be past, nor from 
      Ash-Wednesday, until Low-Sunday be past.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why so?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because those are times of special piety and penance, and 
      should not therefore be spent in feasting, or carnal pleasures.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What sin is to break any of these church commandments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A mortal sin of disobedience, according to that &quot;He that 
      will not hear the church, let him be unto thee as a heather and a 
      publican.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>xvii. 17.<br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">H</font>OW many councils are 
      there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There be three principle ones.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the first of them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Voluntary poverty, which is observed by willingly leaving 
      all things to follow Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that to be a work of perfection?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>xix. 21. &quot;If thou wilt be perfect, go, 
      sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in 
      heaven, and come and follow me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you this to be meritorious?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of the same chap. ver. 27, 28, 29, &quot;When Peter, 
      answering, said to him: Behold, we have left all</p>
      <p>[pg. 75]</p>
      <p align="left">things, and have followed he: what, therefore, shall we 
      have? And Jesus said to them: Amen I say to you, that you, who have 
      followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the 
      seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve 
      tribes of Israel. And every one that hath left house, or brethren, or 
      sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or lands for my name's sake, shall 
      receive a hundred-fold and shall possess life everlasting.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Second Counsel.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the second 
      counsel?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Perpetual chastity; which is a voluntary abstaining from 
      marriage, and all carnal pleasures, for the love of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is this also a work of perfection?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, for Christ himself was born of a virgin, and 
      counselled virginity, though he commanded it not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>xix. 12. &quot;There be eunuchs, (said he,) 
      which have made themselves so for the kingdom of heaven; he that can take 
      let him take.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that virginity is a more prefect state than 
      marriage, or that it is lawful to vow virginity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>vii. 37, 38. &quot;He that hath determined 
      in his heart, being settled, not having any necessity, but having power of 
      his own will to keep his virgin, doth well; therefore he that joineth his 
      virgin in marriage doth well, but he that joineth her not, doth better&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Tim. </i>v. 5. &quot;But she that is a widow 
      indeed, (that is, a vowed widow,) and desolate, let her hope in God, and 
      continue in prayer and supplications night and day.&quot; And ver. 11, 12. &quot;But 
      the younger widows avoid, for they, when they shall be wanton in Christ, 
      will marry, having damnation, because they have made void their first 
      faith, that is, their vow of chastity, according to the fourth council of 
      Carthage, Canon 104, and all the Fathers.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who was the first that taught marriage to be better than 
      virginity, and persuaded priests and nuns to marry?</p>
      <p>[pg. 76]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Jovinian, an old condemned Heretic, 
      according to St. Augustin, in his book Heresies, <i>Her. </i>82, and in 
      his 2d book of Retractions, he calls him a monster for it, and saith the 
      church stoutly resisted him, chap. 22.</p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Third Counsel.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the third counsel?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Obedience, which is a voluntary submission to another's 
      will, and in all that is not sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What warrant have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First the example of Christ himself, who was obedient to 
      our Lady and St. Joseph, &quot;And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, 
      and was subject to them.&quot; <i>Luke </i>ii. 51.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, <i>Heb.</i> xiii. 17. &quot;Obey your prelates, and be 
      subject to them; for they watch, being to render an account for your 
      souls.&quot;</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Of the Sacraments in general.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">H</font>OW many Sacraments are 
      there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Seven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How call you them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreme 
      Unction, Holy Order, and Matrimony. See the Council of Trent, <i>Sess. </i>
      7. <i>Can. </i>1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any cause why the number of Sacraments should be 
      seven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes; a probable cause is the proportion which is between 
      spiritual and corporal life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what consists this proportion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In this; that as in a corporal and nature life, there be 
      seven principle or chief necessities, so are there likewise seven 
      spiritual, to which the seven Sacraments correspond.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is our first corporal necessity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To be born into this world: to this baptism corresponds, 
      by which we are regenerated unto God, and born the heirs of God and 
      co-heirs of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the second corporal necessity?</p>
      <p>[pg. 77]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To be confirmed in our strength and growth, 
      without which we can never be made men: to this answers confirmation, by 
      which we are made strong and perfect Christians, able to profess our faith 
      before our enemies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is our third corporal necessity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That (being now made men) we have a competence of daily 
      food and sustenance; to which the blessed Eucharist corresponds, by which 
      our souls are fed with divine grace as often as we worthily receive it, or 
      offer it with the priest on the altar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the fourth necessity of the body?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we have physic when we are sick and wounded; to this 
      the sacrament of penance answers; by which our maladies and sores of sin 
      are healed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is our fifth necessity of the body?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we have the necessary helps against the agonizing 
      pangs of death; to this corresponds extreme unction, by which our soul is 
      strengthened<i> </i>in her last agony, against the violent assaults of the 
      devil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the sixth corporal necessity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &quot;That we be governed by laws and magistrates, so to avoid 
      injustice and confusion:&quot; to this Holy Order corresponds, by which we are 
      provided with spiritual magistrates to guide and govern us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the seventh corporal necessity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we be multiplied in a lawful manner; and to this 
      matrimony corresponds, by which we are not only multiplied in a natural, 
      but in a holy and sacramental way.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is a Sacramental in general?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a visible sign of invisible grace, divinely 
      instituted by Christ, for our sanctification.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that Christ ordained them all?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is not in the power of any pure creature to 
      give infallible virtue, causing grace, to sensible and material things, 
      such as the sacraments are; according to the council of <i>Trent, Sess.
      </i>7. <i>Can. </i>1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. From what have the Sacraments their force and efficacy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From the blood and passion of Christ, which they apply to 
      our souls.</p>
      <p>[pg. 78]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Rom. </i>vi. 3. &quot;Know you not that all that we who are 
      baptized in Christ Jesus, are baptized in his death?&quot; <i>Rom. </i>v. 9. 
      &quot;Much more therefore, now being justified in his blood, shall we be saved 
      from wrath by him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end did <i>Christ </i>ordain the Sacraments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To be external and visible marks and professions of his 
      holy faith, by which the faithful might be known from Infidels and 
      Heretics; and also to be effectual means of our salvation, and certain 
      remedies against sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What things are essential to a Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Matter and form.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Do all the seven Sacraments give grace?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They do, according to the council of <i>Trent, Sess. </i>
      7.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is grace?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a supernatural quality produced in our souls and 
      inherent in them, by which we are made the adopted children of God, 
      special partakers of the divine nature, and like to God, in some degree; 
      as iron is made like to fire by heat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How many of these Sacraments give character?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Three: Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Order.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is a sacramental character?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a supernatural mark in the soul, whereby be are 
      marked for God's servants, which can never be blotted out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what manner do the sacraments give and cause grace?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. As a means or instruments only; for God is always the 
      principal cause thereof.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who is the ordinary minister of a Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A priest; excepting Holy Orders and Confirmation, which 
      are referred to the Bishops alone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why did Christ confine the administration of the 
      Sacraments to the Heirarchy and to the priests only?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &quot;O the depth of the riches, of the wisdom and of the 
      knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how 
      unsearchable his ways! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who 
      hath been his counsellor?&quot; <i>Rom. </i>xi. And we know from St. Paul, <i>
      Ephes. </i>iv. 11, that &quot;Christ gave indeed some to</p>
      <p>[pg. 79]</p>
      <p align="left">be apostles, and some prophets, and others evangelists, 
      and others pastors and teachers. That we may not now be children, tossed 
      to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, in the 
      wickedness of men, in craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive.&quot; 
      Hence, St. Paul, speaking of the Sacraments, says, 1 <i>Cor. </i>iv. 1. 
      &quot;So let them consider us as the ministers of Christ and dispensers of the 
      mysteries of God.&quot; &quot;And we are (2 <i>Cor.</i> v. 20.) therefore 
      ambassadors of Christ: God, as it were, exhorting by us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is the intention of the ministers to do what Christ 
      ordained, a condition, without which the Sacraments subsist not?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is; also the intention of the receiver to receive what 
      Christ ordained, if he be at the years of understanding?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why say you, If he be at the years of understanding?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because for infants in the Sacraments of baptism the 
      intention of the Church sufficeth.</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="baptism"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><i>Baptism Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HY is Baptism the first 
      Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because by it we are born again, or created anew in Christ 
      Jesus, and therefore before it we are not capable of receiving any other.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is Baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is an exterior washing of the body, under a set form of 
      words.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the necessary matter of Baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Natural water only; for artificial water will not suffice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the form of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
      and of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if a man leave out the word, (I baptize) or any of 
      the three persons?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Then the baptism is invalid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Where did Christ express the form of baptism and give a 
      command to baptize?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In <i>Matt. </i>xxvii. 29. &quot;Go therefore, (saith he) teach 
      ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
      and of the Holy Ghost.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 80]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can a man be saved without baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He cannot, unless he have it either actual or in desire, 
      with contrition, or to be baptized in his blood as the holy <i>Innocents
      </i>were, which suffered for Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John</i> iii. 5. &quot;Unless a man be born again of 
      water, and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can no man but a priest baptize?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, in case of necessity, any layman or woman may do it, 
      and not otherwise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is a chief necessity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When a child is in danger of death, and a priest cannot be 
      had.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It makes us the children of God, and remits both original 
      and actual sin, if he that is baptized be guilty of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it infuseth justifying grace into the soul, with 
      habits of faith, hope, and charity, and all supernatural gifts and 
      virtues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Gal. </i>iii. 27. &quot;As many of you as are 
      baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>vi. 10,11 where speaking of 
      fornicators, idolators, thieves, adulterers, and liars &quot;These things, 
      (saith St. <i>Paul) </i>ye were, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, 
      but ye are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the 
      spirit of God.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Tit. </i>v. 6, 7. &quot;He hath saved us by the 
      laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost, whom he hath 
      abundantly poured out upon us, by Jesus Christ our Saviour, that being 
      justified by his grace we may be heirs, according to the hope of life 
      everlasting.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other effect hath baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It makes a spiritual mark or character in the soul, which 
      shall remain for ever, either to our great joy in heaven, or our confusion 
      in hell.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What sin is it to baptize a man twice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A mortal sin of sacrilege.</p>
      <p>[pg. 81]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Heb. </i>vi. 4, 5, 6. &quot;It is impossible for 
      those that have been illuminated, and made partakers of the Holy Ghost, (<i>to 
      wit, by baptism</i>) and are fallen, &amp;c. to be renewed again unto 
      penance,&quot; &amp;c. viz. by a second baptism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if a man die for the faith, before he can be 
      baptized?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He is a true martyr, and baptized in his own blood.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why have we a Godfather and a Godmother in baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That if our parents should neglect it, or be prevented by 
      death, they may instruct us in the faith of Christ, which obligation lies 
      on them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How many godfathers may we have?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. But one godfather and one godmother, since the council of
      <i>Trent.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. Why so few?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To prevent the too great spread of spiritual affinity, 
      which is contracted between them and their godchild, and his father and 
      mother, which is an impediment, that makes the marriage not only unlawful, 
      but also invalid between the parties.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How can infants be christened, which have no actual faith?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the faith of the Church, and of their godfathers and 
      godmothers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who do we use so many ceremonies in baptism?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To stir up reverence to the sacrament, and signify its 
      inward effects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the priest's breathing on the child's face, 
      according to the use of some rituals?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies, that by baptism, the evil spirit is cast 
      out, and the spirit of God is given him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the child signed on the breast and forehead with 
      the sign of the Cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that he is there made the servant of Christ 
      crucified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is salt put into the child's mouth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, that by baptism he receives grace and gifts to 
      preserve his soul from corruption of sin: and to</p>
      <p>[pg. 82]</p>
      <p align="left">warn Christians, that their actions and words ought to be 
      seasoned with prudence and discretion signified by salt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the priest lay spittle on his ears and nostrils?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because Christ by so doing, healed one that was both deaf 
      and dumb; as also to signify, that by baptism his ears are opened to the 
      word of faith, and his nostrils to the good odour of all Christian 
      virtues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the priest ask the child, &quot;If he renounce the 
      Devil, and his pomps?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, that he who will be the child of God, cannot 
      be the child of the Devil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the several anointing of the child?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They signify the interior anointings, or unction of divine 
      grace, given to the soul in baptism.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean they in particular?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He anointed on the head to signify, &quot;that by baptism he is 
      made partaker of the kingly dignity of Christ;&quot; on the shoulders to 
      signify, &quot;he must bear his Cross courageously,&quot; on the breast, to signify, 
      &quot;that the heart is there strengthened with grace, to fight against the 
      Devil.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the white garment given to the child?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The purity and innocence which he there receives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the hallowed light given to the child?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The light of faith, and fire of charity with which his 
      soul is endued by baptism; and that he is bound to hold up through life 
      the lamp of good works, always burning, always shining before men, that 
      they may glorify our Father who is in Heaven.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Confirmation Expounded</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the second 
      Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Confirmation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did Christ ordain this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The time is not certain; but divines most probably hold, 
      it was instituted at Christ's last supper.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the matter of the Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Oil, mingled with balm, blessed by a bishop.</p>
      <p>[pg. 83]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the form of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I sign thee with the sign of the Cross, I confirm thee 
      with the crism of salvation, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
      and of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What scripture have you for this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, 2 <i>Cor. </i>i. 22. &quot;And he that confirmeth us 
      with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God, who also hath sealed us 
      (with the spiritual character) and given the pledge of the spirit in our 
      hearts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, <i>Acts</i> viii. 14, 15, 16, where when <i>Philip
      </i>the deacon had converted the city of <i>Samaria </i>to the faith, the 
      apostles who were at <i>Jerusalem</i>, sent to two bishops, St. <i>Peter</i> 
      and St. <i>John</i>, to confirm them; &quot;who when they were come (saith the 
      text) prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost; for he was 
      not yet come upon any of them, but they were only baptized in the name of 
      our Lord Jesus; then did they impose their hands upon them, and they 
      received the Holy Ghost.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, <i>Acts </i>xix. 5,6, where we read that St. <i>
      Paul&nbsp;</i> baptized and confirmed about twelve of St. <i>John's </i>
      disciples: &quot;Hearing these things, they were baptized in the name of our 
      Lord Jesus; and when St. <i>Paul </i>had imposed hands on them, the Holy 
      Ghost came upon them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is oil used in this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that the principal and proper effect of it, is 
      the interior unction of the Holy Ghost, which makes us perfect Christians, 
      and able to profess our faith before persecuting tyrants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is balm used in it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the good odour of a Christian name, according 
      to that, &quot;We are a good odour of Christ to God.&quot; 2 <i>Cor. </i>ii. 15.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what appears the effects of confirmation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In the undaunted confidence and sufferings of the 
      apostles, martyrs, and saints of God, after they had received it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When were the apostles confirmed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. On Whitsunday, in an extraordinary manner, the Holy Ghost 
      descended upon them in tongues of fire.</p>
      <p>[pg. 84]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Doth confirmation give a character?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It doth, according to 2 <i>Cor. </i>i. 22, above cited, 
      where we read &quot;who also has sealed us,&quot; (that is, with a character.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who is the minister of this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A bishop only, as appears by <i>Acts </i>viii, above 
      cited, where two bishops were sent into <i>Samaria, </i>to give it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any necessity for this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. There is a moral necessity for it, according to the 
      council of <i>Laodicea, Can. </i>48: &quot;Those that have been baptized, must 
      after baptism receive the most holy chrism, and be made partakers of the 
      heavenly kingdom.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What authority of fathers and school divines have you for 
      its necessity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, the authority of St. <i>Thomas</i>, who in the 
      Sacrament of confirmation, 3P. Q.72, <i>Art. 8</i>, <i>ad</i> 4, affirms 
      that it is a dangerous thing to die without it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, that of St. Jerome, in his epistles against the 
      Luciferians. &quot;Dost thou not know also (saith he) that this is the custom 
      of the churches, that hands should be imposed on such as they have been 
      baptized, and so the Holy Ghost be invocated? Dost thou require to know 
      where it is written? In the acts of the apostles, and though there were no 
      authority of scripture for it, yet the consent of the whole world in this 
      behalf, would be equal to a precept; for many other things also which are 
      observed in the churches by tradition, do usurp unto themselves the 
      authority of a written law.&quot; You see he owns it to be commanded in the 
      scripture; and tho it were not so, yet to be equal to a precept, and have 
      the authority of a written law, because it is an apostolical tradition, 
      that such as have been baptized, must also be confirmed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What authority of Popes have you for it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, that of St. <i>Clement</i>, pope and martyr, in his 
      epistle to <i>Julius</i>, &quot;All must make haste, (mark the word <i>must</i>) 
      without delay to be regenerated to God, and at length consigned (<i>confirmed</i>) 
      by a bishop; that is, to receive the same seven-fold grace of the Holy 
      Ghost.&quot; His</p>
      <p>[pg. 85]</p>
      <p>reason is, first, &quot;Because the end of every one's life is uncertain,&quot; 
      secondly, &quot;Because otherwise he that is baptized, cannot be a perfect 
      Christian, nor have a seat among the perfect; if not by necessity, he 
      shall remain and not have that confirmation, which we have received from 
      blessed <i>Peter</i>, and all the rest of the apostles have taught, or 
      Lord commanding,&quot; Secondly, that of Pope <i>Melchiades</i>, teaching &quot;That 
      baptism and confirmation can by no means be separated one from another, 
      unless by death prevented, and that one of them cannot rightly be 
      perfected without the other. And moreover, that as confirmation is given 
      by greater men, so it is to be held in greater veneration than baptism,&quot; 
      see<i> De Cons</i>., <i>Dist </i>5, <i>Cap. De his.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to this, that without confirmation (according to all the 
      fathers) we are not perfect Christians.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What then would you think of those, who for particular and 
      private ends, should slight this Sacrament, and teach the laity not to 
      receive it, when they might conveniently have it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Truly I think they would slight the mission of the Holy 
      Ghost, (for this Sacrament is a continuance of that mission unto us) and 
      would be great enemies of Christianity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What sin is it not to receive it, when we may conveniently 
      have it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Mortal sin, if it be done out of contempt, or any gross 
      neglect, especially in a place of persecution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because by so doing we expose ourselves to great danger of 
      denying the faith, against which danger, it was peculiarly ordained by 
      Christ our Lord.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. At what age is confirmation now commonly received?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. At seven years old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why not sooner?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That so we may be able to prepare ourselves for it, and 
      remember what we have received it; for it can not be twice given.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is a little blow given on the cheek to him that is 
      confirmed?</p>
      <p>[pg. 86]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify he is there made the 
      soldier of Christ, and must be ready to suffer stripes and buffets for his 
      sake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Must we have any godfathers in confirmation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Only one godfather or godmother.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Must it be received fasting?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That is expedient, (for so the apostles received) but not 
      necessary.</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="eucharist"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><i>The Eucharist Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the third 
      Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The blessed Eucharist, or the Sacrament of the body and 
      blood of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By what was this Sacrament prefigured in the old law?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the tree of life, the burning bush, Mechisedech's bread 
      and wine, the Paschal Lamb, and the heavenly manna.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Doth the blessed Eucharist excel all these in dignity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It doth, as far as the substantial body excels a shadow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the name Eucharist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies good grace, or thanksgiving, because it 
      contains the author and fountain of grace, and the greatest gift of God to 
      man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did Christ ordain the blessed Eucharist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. At his last supper.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why so?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To leave to his church, as the last and greatest pledge of 
      his love.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the blessed Eucharist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the body and blood of Jesus Christ, true God, and 
      true man, under the outward forms of bread and wine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. In what manner is Christ present under these forms?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the true and real presence of his divine and human 
      nature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of <i>Matt. </i>xxvi. 27, 28. Christ at his</p>
      <p>[pg. 87]</p>
      <p>last supper, took bread and blessed it, brake it and gave it to his 
      disciples, saying, &quot;Take eat, this is my body. And he blessed the cup 
      saying, This is my blood of the New Testament which shall be shed for many 
      to the remission of sins,&quot; <i>Mark </i>xiv. 22, 24.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Luke</i> xxii. 19, 20. &quot;This is my body 
      which is given for you, this is the chalice of the New Testament in my 
      blood, which shall be shed for you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>John</i> vi. 52, 53, 54. &quot;The bread which 
      I give is my flesh, for the life of the world; by flesh is meat indeed, 
      and my blood is drink indeed; unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man, 
      and drink his blood, you shall have no life in you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>xi. 23, where St. <i>Paul</i> 
      tells us, &quot;He received from our Lord,&quot; (<i>viz. </i>by special revelation) 
      that at his last supper he blessed bread, saying, &quot;Take ye and eat, this 
      is my body which shall be delivered up for you; this chalice is the New 
      Testament in my blood.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By what means is the body and blood of Christ made under 
      the outward forms of bread and wine?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the real conversion or change of the whole substance of 
      the body and blood of Christ; which conversion is wrought by the most holy 
      and powerful words of consecration, instituted by Christ, and spoken by 
      the priest, and is fitly called <i>Transubstantiation, </i>by the councils 
      of <i>Lateran </i>and <i>Trent; </i>which signifies a passage or 
      conversion of one substance into another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any scripture for <i>Transubstantiation</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The word <i>Transubstantiation </i>is not found in 
      scripture, but for the thing signified by it, there are those places in 
      scripture, which prove a <i>real presence</i>, because those words, <i>
      This is my Body</i>, spoken by Christ, after he had taken bread into his 
      hands, and signifying that to be his body, which before was bread, cannot 
      be true, without the change of of bread into his body; which change is (as 
      I have said already) the thing signified or meant by <i>
      Transubstantiation. </i>Nor may the word be lawfully rejected for not 
      being found in scripture more</p>
      <p>[pg. 88]</p>
      <p>than other words used by the church, to explain mysteries of faith; as 
      the word, <i>Trinity</i> or <i>Consubstantiality </i>of God the Son with 
      God the Father, which are not found in scripture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean you by these species or accidents which remain 
      after the substance of the bread is changed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The colour, taste, and quality of bread.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is the body of Christ divided or broken, when we divide or 
      break the Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is not, for &quot;he is now immortal and impassible, he 
      cannot die nor suffer any more.&quot; <i>Rom.</i>vi. 9.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other reason have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because Christ is whole in the whole host, and whole in 
      every particle thereof, if you divide or break it; seeing that wherever 
      there would have been bread before consecration, there must needs be the 
      whole body and blood of Christ after consecration.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What example have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The <i>Soul of Man, </i>which is whole in the whole body, 
      and whole in every part of the body, as learned Protestants neither do nor 
      can deny.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How can the same thing be in many several places at once?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the omnipotent power of God, by which he himself is in 
      all, and every one of his creatures at the same instant.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What example have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; A word, which being one, yet is in many hundreds of 
      places at once.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Out of <i>Acts </i>ix. 4, 5, where we read, that Christ, 
      who is always sitting at the right hand of the Father in Heaven (as we 
      willingly admit with the Protestants) appeared notwithstanding, and 
      discoursed with St. <i>Paul&nbsp;</i> on earth, saying, &quot;<i>Saul, Saul, </i>why 
      dost thou persecute me?&quot; And when St. <i>Paul&nbsp;</i> replied, &quot;Who art thou, 
      Lord? He answered, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute.&quot; Therefore, he was 
      then in two places at once.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the necessary matter of the Eucharist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Wheaten bread and wine of the grape.</p>
      <p>[pg. 89]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the essential form of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. THIS IS MY BODY, THIS IS MY BLOOD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is a little water mingled with the wine in the 
      chalice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the blood and water flowing from the side of 
      Christ; as also, the union of the faithful with Christ, by virtue of the 
      Sacrament.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What dispositions is required in him that receives the 
      Eucharist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That he hath first confessed his sins, and be in the state 
      of grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>xi. 28. &quot;Let a man prove himself and 
      so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup. For he that eateth and 
      drinketh unworthily, eateth an drinketh damnation to himself, not 
      discerning the body of our Lord.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of the Eucharist?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It replenisheth the soul with grace, and nourisheth it in 
      spiritual life: &quot;He that eateth of this bread, shall live for ever,&quot; <i>
      John</i> vi. 58.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other benefit have we by it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a most moving and effectual commemoration of the 
      incarnation, nativity, passion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove it lawful for the laity, to communicate 
      under one kind only?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, because there is no command in scripture for the 
      laity to do it under both, though there be for priests in those words, 
      &quot;Drink ye all of this.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>xxvi. 27, which was spoken to the 
      apostles only and by them fulfilled; for it follows in <i>Mark </i>xiv. 
      23. &quot;And they all drank.&quot; 2. Out of <i>John</i> vi. 58, &quot;He that eateth of 
      this bread, shall live for ever,&quot; therefore, one kind sufficeth. 3. Out of
      <i>Acts</i> xx. 7, where we read, &quot;That the faithful were assembled on the 
      first of the sabbath to break bread,&quot; without any mention of the cup; and 
      the two disciples in <i>Emmaus, &quot;</i>knew <i>Christ</i> in the breaking of 
      bread,&quot; where the cup is not mentioned. And St. <i>Paul, </i>1 <i>Cor. </i>
      xi. 27. &quot;Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of 
      the Lord unwor-</p>
      <p>[pg. 90]</p>
      <p>thily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the exterior visible sacrifice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It a most necessary act of religion whereby some sensible 
      thing is offered to God by a priest, in order to acknowledge his supreme 
      dominion over us, and our entire dependence on him. It is offered to God 
      as an act of pure adoration, or to render him thanks for his benefits 
      received, or to turn away his anger, or to obtain from him some new 
      blessing, or for all those purposes together.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is the blessed Eucharist a sacrifice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a <i>clean oblation, </i>which the prophet Malachy i. 
      11, foretold would be offered from the rising to the going down of the 
      sun, in every place among the Gentiles; which was prefigured by 
      Melchisedech, priest of the Most High (Gen. xiv. 18,) when he brought 
      forth bread and wine; and which was, in reality, instituted at the last 
      supper by Jesus Christ, when he took bread and wine, blessed them, and 
      distributed them with his own hands amongst the apostles, saying, THIS IS 
      MY BODY; THIS IS MY BLOOD. Christ Jesus is a priest for ever, according to 
      the order of <i>Melchisedech </i>(<i>Heb. </i>v. 8,) and so he instituted, 
      according to his order; that is to say, in bread and wine, this great 
      sacrifice of the NEW LAW.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the Holy Popes, and Fathers, and Councils of the 
      primitive ages, teach that the mass is the self same sacrifice of bread 
      and wine that had been instituted by our Saviour; whilst the histories and 
      annals of all countries, not excepting England herself, declare that the 
      Holy Mass, but no other sacrifice, came down to them as a part and parcel 
      of Christianity, from the apostolic age.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the priests obliged to receive under both kinds?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they offer sacrifice, and represent the bloody 
      sacrifice made upon the cross, where the blood was actually divided from 
      the body, and being offerers of the sacrifice, are bound to receive also 
      the cup, by Christ's command expressed. <i>Matt. </i>xxvi. 27. &quot;Drink ye 
      all of this.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 91]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Did the laity ever communicate under 
      both kinds?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They did sometimes in the primitive church, and may again, 
      if holy church shall so appoint; but now it is prohibited by the church, 
      to prevent the great danger of shedding the cup, neither are the laity in 
      this defrauded of any thing; for they receive whole Christ under one kind, 
      which is incomparably more than the pretended reformers have under both, 
      who receive only a bit of baker's bread, with a cup of common vintner's 
      wine. See &quot;Holy Order expounded.&quot; See also, &quot;The Mass expounded.&quot; ch. 22.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Penance Expounded</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the fourth 
      Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Penance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What warrant have you for doing acts of penance?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Apoc. </i>ii. 4. &quot;Thou hast left thy 
      first charity, therefore be mindful from whence thou art fallen, and do 
      penance?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, &quot;And JESUS began to preach, and say, do ye penance; 
      for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>iv. 17.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did Christ ordain this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When he breathed on his disciples, saying, &quot;Receive ye the 
      Holy Ghost, whose sins ye shall forgive, they are forgiven and whose sins 
      ye shall retain, they are retained.&quot; <i>John </i>xx. 22, 23.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the matter of this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The sins and confession of the penitent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the form of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I absolve thee from they sins, in the name of the Father, 
      and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It reconciles us to God, and either restores or increases 
      grace?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John </i>xx. 23, before cited. And out of <i>
      John</i> i. 9. &quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive 
      us our sins, and cleanse us from all iniquity.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How many parts hath the Sacrament of penance?</p>
      <p>[pg. 92]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It hath three parts; namely, contrition, 
      confession, and satisfaction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is contrition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a hearty sorrow for our sins, proceeding immediately 
      from the love of God above all things, and joined with a firm purpose of 
      amendment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is attrition?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is imperfect contrition, arising from the consideration 
      of the turpitude of sin, or fear of punishment and if it contain a 
      detestation of sin, and hope of pardon, it is so far from being itself 
      wicked, that though alone it justify not, yet it prepares the way to 
      justification; and disposes it at least remotely towards obtaining God's 
      grace in this Sacrament.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if a dying man be in mortal sin, and cannot have a 
      priest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Then nothing but perfect contrition will suffice, it being 
      impossible to be saved, without the love of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is a firm purpose of amendment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a resolution not only to shun sin, but also the 
      occasions of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How long has confession been in use and practice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Ever since the Apostle's time, according to <i>James, </i>
      v. 16. &quot;Confess therefore your sins to one another, and pray for one 
      another, that you may be saved.&quot; And <i>Acts </i>xix. 18. &quot;Many of them 
      that believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is confession?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a full, sincere, and humble declaration of our sins 
      to a priest, to obtain absolution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is there any special good or comfort to man from 
      confession?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Very great, because as to a mind laden with secret griefs, 
      the best of comforts is to disclose her case to some faithful friend; so 
      to a soul laded with secret sins one of the greatest comforts, and best 
      remedies possible, is to have selected persons ordained for that end by 
      Christ himself, men of singular piety and learning, and not questionable 
      by any law of what they hear in confession, to whom one may confess his 
      sins, with</p>
      <p>[pg. 93]</p>
      <p>an assurance both of comfort, correction, and direction for the 
      amendment of his faults.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the necessary conditions of a good confession?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That it be short, diligent, humble, sorrowful, sincere, 
      and entire.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How, short?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By avoiding superfluous words and circumlocutions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How, diligent?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By using a competent time and care in the examining of our 
      conscience.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How, humble?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By making our confession with humble hearts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How, sorrowful?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By stirring up sorrow for our sins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How, sincere?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By confessing our sins plainly, without seeking to lessen 
      or excuse them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How, entire?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By confessing not only in what things we have sinned 
      mortally, but also how often, as near as we are able to remember.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if a man do knowingly leave out any mortal sin in his 
      confession for fear of shame?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He makes his whole confession void, and commits a great 
      sacrilege by lying to the Holy Ghost, and abusing the Sacrament.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the example of Ananias and his wife Saphna, who were 
      struck dead at the feet of St. Peter, for daring to lie to the Holy Ghost.
      <i>Acts </i>v. 5, 10.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is he that hath so done bound to confess all again?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Yes, all that are mortal, together with that which he left 
      out, and the sacrilege he committed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is satisfaction?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The sacramental penance, enjoined us by the priest at 
      confession, (which is considered a part of this sacrament,) besides which 
      we may also add more, for our own sins, by our voluntary prayers, fasting, 
      or other good works, or sufferings.</p>
      <p>[pg. 94]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what do we satisfy by that penance?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For such temporal punishments as remain due sometimes for 
      our sins, after they are forgiven us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How do you prove that priests have power to impose 
      penance?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>vi. 3, where St. <i>Paul</i> 
      excommunicated the incestuous <i>Corinthian; </i>&quot;I (saith he) absent in 
      body, but present in spirit, have already judged him that hath so done, 
      &amp;c. to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that 
      the soul may be saved.&quot; <i>ver. </i>5.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that temporal punishments may remain due for 
      our sins, after the sins themselves be forgiven us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, because <i>Adam, </i>after his sin was forgiven 
      him, was notwithstanding cast out of paradise for ever, and his whole 
      posterity made subject unto death and many miseries, in punishment of that 
      sin. <i>Gen. </i>iii. 25.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because <i>David,</i> after his sin of adultery was 
      forgiven him, was temporally punished for it with the death of his child: 
      &quot;Our Lord (saith <i>Nathan</i>) hath taken away thy sin, nevertheless thy 
      son shall die.&quot; 2 <i>Kings</i> xii. 13, 14.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, because &quot;Whom our Lord loveth he chastiseth.&quot; <i>
      Heb. </i>xii. 6.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By what other means are those temporal punishments 
      released?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By indulgences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is an indulgence?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No a pardon for sins to come, or leave to commit sin, (as 
      Protestants do falsely and slanderously teach) but a releasing only of 
      such temporal punishments, as remain due to those sins, which have already 
      been forgiven us by penance and confession.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How doth an indulgence release those punishments?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By the superabundant merits of Christ and his saints, 
      which it applies to our souls by the special grant of the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did Christ give his church power to grant 
      indulgences?</p>
      <p>[pg. 95]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When he said to St. <i>Peter, </i>
      &quot;To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, whatsoever thou 
      shalt bind on earth, it shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou 
      shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.&quot; <i>Matt. </i>xvi. 19.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the apostles did ever use this power?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 2 <i>Cor. </i>ii. 10, where St. Paul<i> </i>
      remitted part of the <i>Corinthians </i>penance. &quot;To him that is such a 
      one (said he) this rebuke sufficeth, &amp;c. whom you have pardoned any thing, 
      I also pardon.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is required for the gaining an indulgence&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we perform the works enjoined us, and that the last 
      part of them be done in a state of grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are those works?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Fasting, prayer, and alms deeds; as also confession and 
      communion.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;<a name="unction"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><i>Extreme Unction Expounded.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      fifth Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Extreme unction.*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When did Christ institute it?</p>
      <hr width="100%">
      <p><font size="-1">*Unction is twofold, exterior and interior; by the 
      former is the body anointed, and the latter the soul: there is an instance 
      of the former in <i>James </i>v. 14, and of the latter in the parable of 
      the ten virgins, <i>Matt. xxv. </i>The exterior anointing of the body is 
      expressive of the interior unction or invisible grace produced in the 
      soul.</font> <font size="-1">Under the Old Law were the priests, prophets 
      and kings anointed: 1 <i>Kings </i>ix. 16; 2 <i>Kings </i>ii. 4; and <i>3 
      Kings </i>xix. 15.Our Blessed Redeemer is called the Anointed, from the 
      Greek verb <i>Krio</i> which signifies to <i>anoint, </i>because God 
      anointed hem with the Holy Ghost: <i>Acts </i>x. 38. And we are called 
      Christians because we profess the law and doctrine of God, the Anointed; 
      and because we are anointed with holy oil and chrism. The child is 
      anointed at baptism, the priest in receiving Holy Orders, the king and 
      queen at their coronation. That the Apostles anointed the sick is clear 
      from <i>Mark</i> vi. 13, and that they taught the practice is clear from
      <i>James</i> v. 14. Would they teach or practise the rite if they had not 
      commission from their Divine Master so to do? It is indeed extremely 
      astonishing that the Protestants who pretend to be enamoured with the 
      Bible would discard a rite so sanctioned in both Testaments and the usage 
      of all antiquity. See Canons. <i>Lib. </i>i. cit. 15.</font></p>
      <p align="left">[pg. 96]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The time is uncertain: some think it 
      was instituted at his last supper; others that it was done between his 
      resurrection and ascension.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. By whom was this sacrament promulgated?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By <i>James, </i>v. 13, 14, 15. &quot;Is any man sick among 
      you, let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over 
      him, anointing him with oil, in the name of our Lord, and the prayer of 
      faith shall save the sick man, and our Lord will lift him up, and if he be 
      in sin his sins shall be forgiven him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who is capable of this sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Every true and faithful Christian who is in mortal danger 
      of death by sickness, excepting infants, fools, and such as are always 
      mad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the matter of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Oil blessed by a bishop.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the form of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &quot;By his own anointing, and his own most pious mercy, our 
      Lord pardon thee, whatsoever thou hast sinned by thy seeing,&quot; &amp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      And so of the other senses, repeating the same words.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of extreme unction?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It comforts the soul in her last agony against despair, it 
      remits venial sins and removes the relics of sin and restores corporal 
      health, if it be expedient.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Mark</i> vi. 13, where we read, That the 
      apostles anointed with oil many sick, and healed them. Which anointing is 
      understood by many to have been a previous sign of extreme unction, and 
      consequently of its effects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then do so few recover after it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Either because the recovery of the body is not expedient 
      for the soul, or because the sick deferred the sacrament too long, as too 
      many do, or for the other indispositions in the receiver of it</p>
      <p align="left"><a name="order"></a></p>
      <p align="center"><i>Holy Order Expounded.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      sixth Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Holy Order.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. To whom doth this appertain?</p>
      <p>[pg. 97]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To the rulers and ministers of the church, as 
      bishops, priests, deacons, and sub-deacons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What proof have you for bishops, priests and deacons?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For bishops and deacons, out of <i>Phil. </i>i. 1. &quot;To all 
      the saints at <i>Philippi, </i>(saith St. <i>Paul</i>) with the bishops 
      and deacons,&quot; and for the priests out of St. <i>James</i> above cited. &quot;Is 
      any man sick among you, let him bring in the priests of the church.&quot; &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Where did Christ ordain this Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. At his last supper, where he made his Apostles priests, 
      saying, &quot;This is my body which is given for you; do ye this in 
      commemoration of me.&quot; <i>Luke </i>xxii. 19.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What did Christ give them power to do?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To offer the unbloody sacrifice of his own body and blood, 
      which he himself had there ordained, and offered under the outward forms 
      of bread and wine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why did he say, Do ye this in commemoration of me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the unbloody sacrifice of the <i>Mass</i> is a 
      commemoration or memorial of the unbloody sacrifice made on the Cross; nay 
      more, it is a renewal of it in an unbloody manner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of holy order?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It gives spiritual power, to ordain priests, to consecrate 
      the body and blood of Christ, to administer the sacraments, serve the 
      altar, and to preach.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It gives also a spiritual grace, for the well-doing of 
      these offices.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Tim. </i>iv. 14. &quot;Neglect not the grace which 
      is thine by prophecy, with the imposition of the hands of the priesthood.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the proper office of a bishop?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To give holy orders and confirmation, to preach and govern 
      the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To confirm, out of <i>Acts </i>viii. above cited, where we 
      read, &quot;Two bishops were sent to confirm the Samaritans.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 98]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the bishops are of divine 
      right and have authority from God to rule the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Acts </i>xx. 28. &quot;Take heed unto yourselves and 
      to the whole flock, wherein the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops to rule 
      the church of God.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that the bishops only can ordain priests?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Titus </i>i. 5. &quot;For this cause left I thee in
      <i>Crete, </i>that thou shouldest order the things that were wanting, and 
      ordain priests in every city,&quot; (he was a bishop.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What sin is it therefore to oppose <i>Hierarchy </i>and <i>
      Episcopacy </i>either in the whole church, or in particular churches?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a sin of rebellion and high treason against the 
      peace and safety of Christ's spiritual commonwealth, the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because no law can subsist without guards and officers for 
      it. Since therefore Christ hath ordained bishops to be the guards and 
      teachers of his law, they who strike at bishops, strike also at the whole 
      law of Christ, and safety of the people.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it requisite that bishops and pastors should have 
      revenues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they bear a considerable charge and office in the 
      commonwealth, therefore, they ought to have a competence for the 
      performance of it. Secondly, to enable them, as good soldiers of Christ 
      Jesus, to keep clear of worldly cares: for &quot;no man, being a soldier to 
      God, entangleth himself with worldly business; that he may please him to 
      whom he hath engaged himself.&quot; 2 <i>Tim. </i>ii. 4.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the office of a priest?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To offer sacrifice, and administer the rest of the 
      sacraments, excepting holy order and confirmation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you a sacrifice in the New Law?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, because there is a priesthood, as you have heard, 
      and an altar according to that, &quot;We have an altar (saith St. <i>Paul</i>) 
      whereof they have not power to eat, who serve in the tabernacle.&quot; <i>Heb. 
      xiii. 10.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Secondly, out of <i>Mal. </i>i. 11, where he 
      foretold the</p>
      <p>[pg. 99]</p>
      <p>sacrifice in the new law, saying, &quot;From the rising of the sun, even to 
      the going down, great is my name among the Gentiles, and in every place 
      there is sacrificing, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation, 
      saith the Lord of Hosts.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Luke</i> xxii. 19, 20, where Christ who is 
      high priest for ever (according to the order of <i>Melchesedech) </i>
      offered the sacrifice of his own body and blood under the form of bread 
      and wine, saying, &quot;This is my body which is given for you, (it is given 
      for us, you find at his last supper) this is the chalice of the New 
      Testament in my blood, which chalice (according to the great text) is shed 
      for you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful for priests to marry?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is not; there being a precept of the church against it, 
      descending to us by tradition from the Apostles; neither did any of the 
      Apostles ever accompany their wives, after their calling to the 
      apostleship; and a vow of perpetual chastity being annexed to the holy 
      orders, in the <i>Latin </i>or <i>Western </i>church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it requisite that priests should live chaste and 
      unmarried?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because, as by their ordination they are bound to teach 
      and instruct the faithful, their minds should be totally disengaged from 
      the cares and pleasures of the world, and wholly employed in the study and 
      piety of heavenly things, which is incompatible with the marriage state. 1
      <i>Cor. </i>vii. 32.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the lesser orders of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. <i>Acolyte, lector, exorcist, </i>and <i>porter, </i>
      according to the fourth council of <i>Carthage, can. </i>6.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it lawful for women to preach, or to be priests?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is not, according to 1 <i>Cor. </i>xiv. 34. &quot;Let women 
      keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak, 
      but to the subject, as also the law saith.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. It is lawful for a man to usurp and take upon him priestly 
      power, without the ordination of the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is not, according to <i>Heb. </i>v. 1, 4. &quot;For every 
      high priest taken from among men, is appointed for men &amp;c. that he may 
      offer gifts and sacrifices for sins</p>
      <p>[pg. 100]</p>
      <p align="left">neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he 
      that is called of God, as was <i>Aaron.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John </i>x. 1. &quot;Amen I say unto you, he that 
      entereth not by the door (<i>Holy Order</i>) into the fold of the sheep, 
      but climbs up another way, is a thief and a robber.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if any man pretend an extraordinary calling?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He must prove it by miracles, or else be esteemed an 
      impostor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What examples have you against the usurpation of the 
      priestly power?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That the king <i>Ozeas, </i>who was presently struck by 
      God with a leprosy in his forehead, for usurping the priestly office of 
      offering or burning incense in the temple. 2 <i>Paral. </i>xxvi. 19.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What besides?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The example of <i>Core, Dathan, </i>and <i>Abriam, </i>who 
      for usurping the office of priest, (though they were themselves true 
      believers) were swallowed up alive by the earth, <i>Numb.</i> xvi. 32. and 
      two hundred and fifty others who were offering incense with them, were 
      consumed with fire from heaven, v. 34, with fourteen thousand and seven 
      hundred more, which were also burnt with fire from heaven, for only 
      joining with them, v. 49.</p>

      <p align="center"><i>Matrimony Expounded.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; &nbsp;Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the seventh 
      Sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Matrimony.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Where was matrimony first ordained?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In paradise by Almighty God, when he gave <i>Eve </i>as 
      wife to <i>Adam</i>, who presently said, &quot;Therefore a man shall leaven his 
      father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be 
      two in one flesh.&quot; <i>Gen. </i>ii. 22, 24.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Where was it made a sacrament of the new law?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Where and when Christ instituted this sacrament us 
      uncertain; some think it done, or at least insinuated at the wedding at <i>
      Cana</i> in <i>Galilee</i>, where Christ was present, and wrought his 
      first miracle, &quot;by turning wa-</p>
      <p>[pg. 101]</p>
      <p>ter into wine.&quot; <i>John </i>ii.&nbsp; Others, more probably, say it was 
      done, when Christ declared the indissolubility of marriage, saying, 
      &quot;therefore now they are not two, but one flesh: that therefore which God 
      hath joined together, let no man separate.&quot; <i>Matt. xix. 6.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was it requisite that marriage should be made a 
      sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is a contract whereon depends the chief 
      happiness of a married life; as being ordained for the restraint of sinful 
      concupiscence, the good of posterity, the well-ordering our domestic 
      affairs, and the education of our children in the fear and service of God, 
      and therefore ought to be ranked in the highest order of those actions, 
      which Christ hath sanctioned for the use of man.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Ephes. </i>v. 31, 32. &quot;They shall be two in one 
      flesh; this is the great sacrament. But I speak in Christ, and in the 
      church.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the matter of this sacrament?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The mutual consent of the parties, and giving themselves 
      to one another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of matrimony?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It gives special grace to the married couple, to love and 
      bear on with another, as also to bring up their children in the fear and 
      love of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the principle end of marriage?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To beget children, and bring them up in the service of 
      God; and the next to this is, that man may have a remedy against 
      concupiscence, and a helper in the way of salvation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How great is the tie of marriage?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. So great that it can never be dissolved but by death, as 
      you have heard out of <i>Matt. </i>xix.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the obligations of man and wife?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To love, honour, and comfort one another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What besides?</p>
      <p>[pg. 102]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Husbands are obliged to cherish and comfort their 
      wives; wives to be subject, obey, and love their husbands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Col. </i>iii. 18, 19. &quot;Women be subject to your 
      own husbands, as behooveth in our Lord. Men, love your wives, and be not 
      bitter towards them.&quot; And out of <i>Ephes. </i>iv. 22, 23. &quot;Let women be 
      subject to their husbands, as to the Lord, because the man is head of the 
      woman as Christ is head of the church,&quot; v. 24. &quot;But as the Church is 
      subject to Christ, so also women to their husbands in all things.&quot; And 
      again, v. 33. &quot;Let each man love his wife as himself, and let the wife 
      reverence her husband.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To render mutually the marriage debt, and according to 
      that, &quot;Let the husband render his debt unto his wife, and the wife also in 
      like manner to her husband. The women now hath no power of her own body, 
      but the husband, and in like manner the man hath no power of his own body, 
      but the woman.&quot; 1 <i>Cor. </i>vii. 3, 4.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. It is lawful for children to marry without the consent of 
      their parents?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is not; neither is it lawful for parents to force them 
      to marry against their will.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are so many unhappy in their marriages?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they never consulted with God about them, nor 
      sought to have his blessing in them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what other reason?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they were in the state of sin at their marriage, 
      or married for inordinate love or wealth, and not for the right end of 
      marriage.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the blessing of the priest given in marriage?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is to beg all blessings of God for the new married 
      couple.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the ring put on the fourth finger?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because that is called the heart finger and hath (they 
      say) a vein in it, with reacheth to the heart; so to signify the true and 
      constant love which ought to be between man and wife.</p>
      <p>[pg. 103]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the ring itself?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a symbol of perfection and eternity, being equal in 
      all parts, and round in figure, without beginning or end, to imitate the 
      perfect and perpetual love of man and wife.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the spiritual means to obtain the blessing of 
      good children?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Fasting, prayer, and alms-deeds, for so St. <i>Joachim </i>
      and St. <i>Anne</i> obtained Blessed Virgin <i>Mary</i>; and so the 
      Blessed Virgin became the mother of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What obligations have parents to their children?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To instruct them in the faith of Christ, to bring them up 
      in the fear of God, to give them good example, to keep them out of ill 
      company and other occasions of sin, to feed and nourish them, to provide 
      for them in marriage, and to correct their faults.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the chief and most common impediments of 
      marriage?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Consanguinity and affinity, to the fourth degree 
      inclusively; and in the right line all degrees are prohibited by the law 
      of nature, indispensable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Can the church dispense in these collateral degrees?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. She can, excepting only the first collateral degrees of 
      consanguinity, but always sufficient motives must be given.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Church having made these laws, for just reasons may 
      dispense in them; but when such dispensations are given, those who seek 
      them ought to consider, that they may deprive themselves of the blessings 
      attending the marriage state, if the motives alleged be not well founded.<br>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">H</font>OW many 
      cardinal virtues are there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.&nbsp; There are four: prudence, justice, fortitude, and 
      temperance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are they called cardinal virtues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are the fountains and as it were the</p>
      <p>[pg. 104]</p>
      <p>hinges of all good works, from the word <i>Cardo, </i>which signifies a
      <i>hinge.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What is prudence?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a virtue which makes us wary in all our actions, 
      that we may neither deceive others, nor be deceived ourselves; or which 
      (according to the rule of honesty) prescribes us what to be desired, and 
      what to be avoided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Eccles.&nbsp;</i> iii. 32. &quot;A wise heart that hath 
      understanding, will keep itself from all sin, and in the works of justice 
      shall have success.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is justice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a virtue which gives every man this own according to 
      that, &quot;Render to all men their due, to whom tribute, tribute; to whom 
      custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.&quot; <i>Rom. </i>
      xiii. 7.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is temperance?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a virtue which moderates our appetites and desires, 
      that they be according to reason, and not inordinate: &quot;He that is 
      abstinate, (saith the wise man) shall increase in life.&quot; <i>Eccl. </i>
      xxxvii.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is fortitude?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a virtue, by which the labours and dangers even of 
      death itself, that are opposite unto virtue, are courageously undertaken 
      and patiently sustained, &quot;The wicked fleeth (saith <i>Soloman</i>) when no 
      man pursueth; but the just man, as a confident lion, shall be without 
      fear.&quot; <i>Prov.&nbsp;</i> xxvii. 1. And in 1 <i>Pet. </i>iii. 14, we read, &quot;The 
      fear of them fear ye not, and be not troubled, but sanctify our Lord 
      Christ in your hearts.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is it necessary for a Christian to be exercised in these 
      virtues?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is; for &quot;we must not only decline from evil, but do

      reward?</p>
      <p>[pg. 107]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because Christ hath promised the kingdom of 
      Heaven as the reward of them. &quot;Come, O ye blessed of my Father (saith he) 
      and possess ye the kingdom, &amp;c. for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat,&quot;

      should forget the work and love, which you have shown in his name, who 
      have ministered unto the Saints, and do minister.<br>

      afflicted. 5. To forgive offences. 6. To bear patiently the troublesome. 
      7. To pray for the quick and the dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you your prayer for the dead?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of the places before and after cited for 
      purgatory. Secondly, out of 1 <i>John</i> v. 16. &quot;He that knoweth his 
      brother to sin a sin not unto death, let him ask, and life shall be given 
      him, not sinning to death; (i.e.) to final impenitence. Therefore it is 
      lawful to pray for all such as die penitent, confessing their sins.&quot; And

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>John </i>iii. 5. &quot;Unless a man be born again of 
      water, and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is actual sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a thought, word or deed, contrary to the law of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the sin of omission?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To omit any thing willing, which is commanded by God or 
      his Church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is actual sin so called?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the material part of it is commonly some voluntary 
      acts of ours.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is all sin voluntary and deliberate?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, because (speaking of actual sin) no man sinneth in 
      doing that which is not in his power to avoid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the whole gospel of Christ is nothing else but an 
      exhortation to do good, and avoid evil, than which nothing were more vain, 
      if it be not the free election and power of man, assisted by God's grace, 
      to do, or not to do such things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What scripture have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First out of <i>Gen.</i> iv. 7. &quot;If thou dost well, shalt 
      thou not receive? But if ill, shall not thy sin be forthwith present at 
      the door? But the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have 
      dominion over it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly out of <i>Deut.</i> xxx. 19, 20. &quot;I call heaven and 
      earth to witness this day, that I have proposed to thee life and death, 
      blessing and cursing, choose therefore life that thou mayest live.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>vii. 37. &quot;He that hath 
      determined in his heart being settled not having necessity</p>
      <p>[pg. 110]</p>
      <p>but having the power of his own will, and hath judged in his heart to 
      keep his virginity, doth well;&quot; (you see man hath power of his own will) 
      and in <i>Phil. </i>iv. 13. &quot;I can do all things (saith <i>Paul</i>) in 
      him who strengtheneth me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Doth not the efficacy of God's grace hinder, and hurt the 
      freedom of our will?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, it perfects it according to 1 <i>Cor.</i> xv. 10, 11. 
      &quot;I have laboured more abundantly (saith <i>Paul</i>) than all they, yet 
      not I, but the grace of God within me.&quot; You hear the grace of God did not 
      hinder, but perfect his working.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How is actual sin divided?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Into mortal and venial.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is mortal sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. And great offence against the love of God; and is so 
      called because it kills the soul, and robs it of the spiritual life of 
      grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is venial sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A small, and very pardonable offence against God, or our 
      neighbour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that some sins are mortal?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of <i>Rom. </i>vi. 23. &quot;For the wages of sin is 
      death.&quot; And ver. xxi. &quot;What fruit therefore had you then in these things, 
      for which ye are now ashamed, for the end of them is death?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, out of <i>Wis. </i>xvi. 14. &quot;For man by malice, 
      killeth his own soul.&quot; And out of <i>Ezek. </i>xviii. 4. &quot;The soul that 
      sinneth, the same shall die.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that some sins are venial?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. First, out of 1 <i>John </i>i. 8, where speaking of such 
      as walk in the light, and are cleansed from all mortal sin by the blood of 
      Christ, he adds, &quot;if we stay we have no sin, we seduce ourselves, and the 
      truth is not in us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, &quot;In many things we all offend,&quot; <i>James </i>iii 2. 
      And in <i>Prov. </i>xxiv. 16. &quot;The just man falleth seven times.&quot; Not 
      mortally, for then he were no longer just, therefore venially.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, out of <i>Matt. </i>xii. 36. &quot;But I say unto you, 
      every idle word which men shall speak, they shall ren-</p>
      <p>[pg. 111]</p>
      <p>der an account for it at the day of judgment.&quot; Now God forbid every 
      idle word should be a mortal sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the effects of venial sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It doth not rob the soul of life, as mortal sin doth, but 
      only weakeneth the fervour of charity, and by degrees disposeth unto 
      mortal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are we bound to shun not only mortal, but venial sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because &quot;he that contemneth small things, shall fall by 
      little and little.&quot; <i>Eccles. </i>xix. 1.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because &quot;no polluted thing shall enter into the heavenly 
      Jerusalem.&quot; <i>Apoc.</i> xxi. 27, be it polluted with mortal, or venial 
      sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How shall we be able to know when any sin is mortal, and 
      when but venial?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because to any mortal sin it is required, both that it be 
      deliberate, and perfectly voluntary; and that it be a matter of weight 
      against the law of God; one or both of which conditions are always wanting 
      in a venial sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How is mortal sin remitted?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By hearty penance and contrition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How is venial sin remitted?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. By all the sacraments, by holy water, devout prayer, 
      alms-deeds, and the like good works.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Whither go such as die in venial sin, or not having fully 
      satisfied for the temporal punishments due to their mortal sins which are 
      forgiven them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To purgatory till they have made full satisfaction for 
      them, and then to heaven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you there is a purgatory, or a place of 
      punishment, where souls are purged after death?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Out of 1 <i>Pet. </i>iii. 10. &quot;Christ being dead for our 
      sins, came in spirit, and preached to them also that were in prison, who 
      had been incredulous in the days of <i>Noah</i>, when the Ark was 
      building.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Cor. </i>iii. 13. &quot;The work of every man</p>
      <p>[pg. 112]</p>
      <p>shall be manifest, for the day of our Lord will declare it, because it 
      shall be revealed in fire; and the work of every one of what kind it is, 
      the fire shall try; If a man's work abides,&quot; (as theirs doth who deserve 
      no purgatory) he shall suffer loss, but himself shall be saved, yet so as 
      by fire.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What besides?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>v. 25. &quot;Be thou at agreement with thy 
      adversary betimes whilst thou art in the way with him (that is in this 
      life) lest perhaps the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge 
      deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison (<i>Purgatory</i>): 
      Amen, I say unto thee, thou shalt not go out from thence, till thou pay 
      the last farthing.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other yet?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt.</i> xii. 32. &quot;Some sins shall neither be 
      forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come.&quot; Therefore there is a 
      place of purging and pardoning sins after this life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How is a man made guilty, or said to co-operate to other 
      men's sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. As often as he is an actual cause of sin in others by any 
      of these nine means: 1. By counsel. 2. By command. 3. By consent. 4. By 
      provocation. 5. By praise or flattery. 6. By silence. 7. By connivance. 8. 
      By participation; or 9. By defence of the ill done.<br>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the virtue opposite to

      covetousness?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. An inordinate desire of riches.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When is covetousness a mortal sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. When either we desire to get unjustly what which is 
      another man's of considerable value, or else refuse to give of that which 
      is our own, to such as are in any extreme or great necessity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the first part?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>Tim. </i>vi. 9. &quot;They, who would become rich, 
      fall into temptation, and into the snare of the devil, and into many 
      unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men in destruction and 
      perdition: for covetousness is the root of all evils.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the latter part?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 1 <i>John </i>iii. 17. &quot;He that hath the substance 
      of this world, and shall see his brother in necessity, and shall shut up 
      his bowels from him; how doth the charity of God abide in him?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you for alms?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Luke</i> xi. 41. &quot;But yet that which remains, 
      give alms, and behold all things are clean unto you.&quot; And out of <i>Dan.

      of the poor.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the daughters of covetousness?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Hardness of heart, unmercifulness to the poor unquiet 
      solicitude, neglect of heavenly things, and confidence in things of this 
      world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Usury, fraud, rapine, theft, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the remedies of covetousness?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To consider &quot;that it is a kind of idolatry,&quot; according to
      <i>Col. </i>iii. 5. And that &quot;it is harder for a rich man to enter into 
      heaven, that for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.&quot; <i>Matt.
      </i>xix. 24.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the virtues opposite to covetousness?</p>
      <p align="left">[pg. 115]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Liberality, which makes a man give freely to the poor; and 
      justice, which renders to a men that which is theirs. &quot;It is a more 
      blessed thing thing to give (saith our Lord) than to take.&quot; <i>Acts </i>
      xxvi. 35. And 2 <i>Cor. </i>ix. 6, St. <i>Paul </i>saith, &quot;He that soweth 
      sparingly, sparingly also shall he reap; but he that soweth in blessings, 
      of blessings also shall he reap; for God loves the cheerful giver.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center"><i>Lechery Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is lechery, or lust?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. An inordinate desire of carnal sin, or delights of the 
      flesh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the malice of this sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the whole world was once drowned, and the cities 
      of <i>Sodom </i>and <i>Gemorrah </i>were burnt with fire from heaven for 
      it. <i>Gen. </i>vii. 21, and xix. 24.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Rom. </i>viii. 13. &quot;For if you live according to 
      the flesh, you shall die; but if by the spirit you mortify the deeds of 
      the flesh, you shall live.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the degrees of lust?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Thought, delight, consent, and act.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the daughters of lust?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Fornication, whoredom, adultery, voluntary pollution, 
      unchaste signs and touches, wanton kisses and speeches.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you voluntary pollution to be a mortal sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Gen. </i>xxxviii. 9, where we read, that <i>Onan</i> 
      was struck dead by God in the place, for shedding the seed of nature out 
      of the due use of marriage to hinder generation, which fact the holy text 
      calls a <i>destestable thing</i>. He also who was eldest brother to this
      <i>Onan</i>, was slain by God, as we read in the same chapter, ver. 7. And 
      it is generally thought by expositors, that his sudden death was in 
      punishment for the like sin of pollution.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the lustful kisses and touches mortal sins?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they vehemently dispose to fornication and 
      pollution.</p>
      <p>[pg. 116]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Is kissing by way of civility, when 
      we meet friend, any sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, it is not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the remedies of lust?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To consider the beastliness of it, and that by it we make 
      our bodies, which are members of Christ, to be members of an harlot. 1 <i>
      Cor. </i>vi. 15.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To consider that God and his angels are even witnesses of 
      it, how private soever it may seem.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What if the virtue opposite to lechery?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Chastity, which makes us abstain from carnal pleasures. 
      &quot;Let us behave ourselves (saith St. <i>Paul)</i> as the ministers of God, 
      in much patience, in watching, in fasting, in chastity.&quot; 2 <i>Cor. </i>vi. 
      4, 6.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the greatness of this virtue?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Apoc. </i>xiv. 4. &quot;These are they who were not 
      defiled with women, for they are virgins, these follow the Lamb 
      withersoever he shall go.&quot;</p>
      <p align="center"><i>Envy Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is envy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a sadness or repining at another's good, in as much 
      as it seems to lessen our own excellency.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you envy to be a mortal sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because, by the &quot;Devil's envy death entered into the 
      world, and envy was the cause of all sin.&quot; <i>Wis. </i>ii. 24.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the daughters of envy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Hatred, detraction, rash judgment, strife, reproach, 
      contempt, and rejoicing at another's evil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the remedies of envy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To consider that it robs us of charity, and deforms us to 
      the likeness of the Devil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the opposite to envy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Brotherly love, which is the chiefest badge of 
      Christianity, &quot;In this all men should know that you are my disciples, if 
      you love one another.&quot; <i>John</i> xiii. 35.</p>

      sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Cor. </i>vi. 10. &quot;Drunkards shall not possess 
      the kingdom of God.&quot; And <i>Luke</i> xxi. 34. &quot;Take heed to yourselves,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the daughters of gluttony?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Babbling scurrility, spewing, sickness, and dullness of 
      soul and body.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the remedies of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To consider the abstinence of Christ and his Saints, and 
      that &quot;gluttons are enemies to the cross of Christ, whose end is 
      destruction.&quot; <i>Phil. </i>iii. 19.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Hatred, passion, fury, clamour, threats, contumey, 
      cursing, blasphemy, and murder.<br>

      19. &quot;In your patience you shall possess your souls.&quot; And that of St. <i>
      Paul</i>. &quot;Be gentle one to another, pardoning one another, as also God in 
      Christ hath pardoned you.&quot; <i>Ephes. </i>iv. 32.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the virtue opposite to anger?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Patience, which suppresseth in us all passion, and desire 
      of revenge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you the necessity and force of patience?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Heb. </i>x. 36. &quot;Patience is necessary for you,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To remember that of <i>Jeremiah</i> xlvii. 10. &quot;Cursed be 
      he that doth the work of the Lord negligently.&quot; And to consider with what 
      diligence men do worldly business.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the virtue opposite to sloth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Diligence, which makes us careful and zealous to 
      performing our duty both to God and men. &quot;Take heed, watch and pray, for 
      you know not when the time is,&quot; <i>Matt. </i>xiii. 33. &quot;Strive to enter by 
      the narrow gate, for many I say to you, shall seek to enter, and shall not 
      be able.&quot; <i>Luke </i>xiii. 24.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Sins against the Holy Ghost Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">H</font>OW many are the sins 
      against the Holy Ghost?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Six: despair of salvation, presumption of God's mercy, to 
      impugn the known truth, envy at another's spiritual good, obstinacy in 
      sin, and final impenitence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is despair of salvation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a diffidence in the mercies and power of God as 
      also, in the merits of Jesus Christ, as if they were not of force enough 
      to save us. This was the sin of <i>Cain, </i>when he said, &quot;My sin is 
      greater than I can</p>
      <p>[pg. 119]</p>
      <p>deserve pardon.&quot; <i>Gen. </i>iv. 13. And of <i>Judas, </i>&quot;when casting 
      down the silver pieces in the temple, he went and hanged himself.&quot; <i>
      Matt. </i>xxvii. 4, 5.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the presumption of God's mercy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A foolish confidence of salvation, without leading a good 
      life, or any care to keep the commandments; such as they entertain who 
      think they will be saved by faith only, without good works.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is it to impugn the known truth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To argue obstinately against known points of faith, or to 
      prevent the way of our Lord by forging lies and slander, as Heretics do, 
      when they teach the ignorant people, that Catholics worship images as God, 
      and give Angels and Saints the honour which is due to God; or that the 
      Pope for money gives us pardon to commit what sins we please; that all 
      which, greater falsehoods cannot be invented.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the envy to another's spiritual good?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A sadness or repining at another's growth in virtue and 
      perfection; such as sectaries seem to have when they scoff and are 
      troubled at the frequent fasts, prayers, feasts, pilgrimages, alms-deeds, 
      vows, and religious orders of the Catholic Church, calling them 
      superstitious and fooleries, because they have not in their churches any 
      such practices of piety.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is obstinacy in sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A wilful persisting in wickedness, and running on from sin 
      to sin, after sufficient instructions and admonition.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How show you the malice of this sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Heb. </i>x. 26, 27. &quot;If we sin wilfully after 
      having received the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice 
      for sins, but a certain dreadful expectation of judgment.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of 2 <i>Pet. </i>ii. 21. &quot;It was better for them not 
      to know the way of justice, than after the knowledge to turn back from the 
      holy commandment which was given them.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is final impenitence?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To die without either confession or contrition for</p>
      <p>[pg. 120]</p>
      <p>our sins, as those do of whom it is said, &quot;With a hard neck, and with 
      uncircumcised hearts and ears, you always resist the Holy Ghost.&quot; <i>Acts
      </i>vii. 51. And in the person of whom Job speaks, saying, &quot;Depart thou 
      from us, and we will not have the knowledge of thy ways.&quot; <i>Job </i>xxi. 
      14.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it said that those sins should never be forgiven, 
      neither in this world, nor in the world to come?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Not because there is no power in God or in the sacraments 
      to remit them, if we confess them, and be sorry for them, (excepting only 
      final impenitence) of which we read, &quot;There is a sin to death for that I 
      say not that any man ask.&quot; 1 <i>John </i>i. 9. &quot;If we confess our sins, he 
      is faithful and just to forgive our sins, and cleanse us from all 
      iniquity.&quot;<br>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">H</font>OW many such sins are 
      there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Four.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the first of them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Wilful murder, which is a voluntary and unjust taking away 
      another's life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How show you the pravity of this sin?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Gen. </i>iv. 10. Where it is said to <i>Cain </i>
      &quot;What hast thou done? the voice of the blood of thy brother crieth to me 
      from the earth: now, therefore shalt thou be cursed upon the earth.&quot; And
      <i>Matt. </i>xxvi 52, &quot;All that take the sword, shall perish with the 
      sword.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the second?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The sin of Sodom, or carnal sin against nature, which is a 
      voluntary shedding of the seed of nature, out of the due use of marriage, 
      or lust with a different sex.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the scripture proof of this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Gen. </i>xix. 13. where we read of the <i>So</i>-</p>
      <p>[pg. 121]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<i>domites</i>, and their sin. &quot;We will destroy this place because the 
      cry of them hath increased before our Lord, who hath sent us to destroy 
      them,&quot; (and they were burnt with fire from heaven.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the third?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Oppressing of the poor, which is a cruel, tyrannical, and 
      unjust dealing with inferiors.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What other proof have you of that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Exod.</i> xxii. 21. &quot;Ye shall not hurt the widow 
      and the fatherless: If you do hurt them, they will cry unto me, and I will 
      hear them cry, and my fury shall take indignation, and I will strike thee 
      with the sword.&quot;<br>
      And out of <i>Isa. </i>x. 1, 2. &quot;Wo to them that make unjust laws, that 
      they might oppress the poor in judgment, and do violence to the cause of 
      the humble of my people.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the fourth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To defraud working men of their wages, which is to lessen, 
      or detain it from them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What proof have you of it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Eccl. </i>xxxiv. 37. &quot;He that sheddeth blood and 
      he that defraudeth the hired man, are brethren,&quot; and out of <i>James</i> 
      v. 4. &quot;Behold the hire of the workmen that have reaped your fields, which 
      is defrauded by you, crieth, and their cry hath entered into the ears of 
      the Lord God of Sabaoth.&quot;<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Four Last Things Expounded.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT are the four last 
      things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Death, Judgment, Hell, and Heaven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by death?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That we are mortal, and shall once die; how soon, we are 
      uncertain, and therefore we must be always prepared for it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Heb. </i>ix. 27. &quot;It is decreed for all men once 
      to die.&quot; And <i>Matt. </i>xxv. 13. &quot;Watch ye therefore, because ye know 
      not the day nor the hour.&quot;</p>
      <p>[pg. 122]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the best preparation for death?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A godly life, and to be often doing penance for our sins, 
      and saying with St. <i>Paul, </i>&quot;I desire to be dissolved and to be with 
      Christ.&quot; <i>Phil. </i>i. 23.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To remember often that of <i>Matt. </i>xvi. 25. &quot;He that 
      will save his life shall lose it, and he that shall lose his life for me 
      shall find it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by judgment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I understand, that (besides the general judgment at the 
      last day) our souls as soon as we are dead, shall receive their particular 
      judgment at the tribunal of Christ, according to that, &quot;Blessed are the 
      dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth now, saith the spirit, they 
      rest from their labours, for their works follow them.&quot; <i>Apoc. </i>xiv. 
      13.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the best preparation from this judgment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To remember often that of <i>Heb. </i>x. 31. It is a 
      terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&quot; And that of 1 <i>
      Cor. </i>xi. 21. &quot;For if we did judge our selves, we should not be 
      judged.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by hell?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That such as die in mortal sin &quot;shall be tormented there 
      both day and night, and for ever and ever.&quot; <i>Apoc. </i>xx. 21. &quot;There 
      shall be weeping, howling, and gnashing of teeth; the worm of conscience 
      shall always gnaw them, and the fire that torments them, shall never be 
      extinguished.&quot; <i>Mark</i> viii. 44, 45.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What understand you by heaven?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That the elect and faithful servants of God, shall for 
      ever reign with him in his kingdom, &quot;where he hath such delights and 
      comforts for them, as neither eye hath seen or ear hath heard, neither 
      hath it entered into the heart of man.&quot; 1 <i>Cor. </i>ii. 9.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Matt. </i>vii. 21. &quot;He hath doth the will of my 
      Father who is in heaven, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What profit is there in the frequent memory of all those 
      things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Very great according to that, &quot;In all thy works</p>
      <p>[pg. 123]</p>
      <p>remember the last things, and thou shalt never sin.&quot; <i>Eccles. </i>
      vii. 40. which God of his great mercy give us grace to do. <i>Amen.</i><br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Substance or Essence, and Ceremonies of the Mass, 
      Expounded.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is the 
      mass?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the unbloody sacrifice of Christ's body and blood, 
      under the forms of bread and wine. The word <i>Mass, </i>used in <i>
      English, </i>being derived from <i>Missa, Latin; </i>and the word <i>Missa,
      </i>though it may have other derivations, may be well taken from the <i>
      Hebrew</i> word <i>Missach, </i>which signifies a free voluntary offering.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who instituted the substance or essence of the Mass?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Our Saviour Christ at his last supper, when he 
      consecrated, <i>i.e.</i> converted the substance of bread and wine into 
      his own true body and blood, and gave the same to his disciples, under the 
      outward forms of bread and wine, commanding them to do what he had done in 
      commemoration of him. <i>Luke </i>xxii. 19.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who ordained the ceremonies of the mass?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The church, directed by the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end did the church ordain them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To stir up devotion in the people, and reverence to the 
      sacred mysteries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what other end?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To instruct the ignorant in spiritual and high things by 
      sensible and material signs; and by the glory of the church militant to 
      make them comprehend something of the glory of the triumphant church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What warrant hath the church to ordain ceremonies?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The authority of God himself in the old law, commanding 
      many and most stately ceremonies in things belonging to his service. See 
      the whole book of <i>Leviticus.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What besides?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The example of Christ in the new law using dust</p>
      <p>[pg. 124]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      and spittle to cure the blind, the deaf, and dumb. He prostrated himself 
      at prayer in the garden three times. He lifted up his eyes to heaven and 
      groaned, when he was raising <i>Lazarus</i> from the dead, which were all 
      ceremonies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Did he use any ceremonies at the last supper, where he 
      ordained the sacrifice of the mass?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He did; for he washed the feet of his disciples, he 
      blessed the bread and the cup, and exhorted the communicants.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signify the several ornaments of the priest?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The <i>Amict,</i> or linen veil, which he first puts on, 
      represents the veil with which the <i>Jews</i> covered the face of Christ, 
      when they buffeted him in the house of <i>Caiaphas, </i>and bid him 
      prophesy, &quot;who it was that struck him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The <i>Alb</i> signifies the white garment, which <i>Herod
      </i>put on him, to intimate that he was a fool.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The <i>Girdle&nbsp;</i> signifies the cord that bound him in 
      the garden.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The <i>Maniple, </i>the cord which bound him to the 
      pillar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The <i>Stole, </i>the cord by which they led him to the 
      crucified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The priest's upper, <i>Vestment</i>, represents both the 
      seamless coat of Christ, as also the purple garment with which they 
      clothed him in derision in the house of <i>Pilate.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The <i>Altar-stone, </i>represents the cross on which he 
      offered himself unto the Father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The <i>Chalice</i>, the sepulchre or grave of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. The <i>Paten, </i>the stone which was rolled to the door 
      of the sepulchre.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. The <i>Altar-cloths</i>, with the <i>corporal </i>and <i>
      Pall, </i>the linen in which the dead body of Christ was shrouded and 
      buried. Finally, the candles on the <i>Altar </i>puts us in mind of the 
      light which Christ brought into the world by his passion, as also of his 
      immortal and ever shining divinity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the priest's coming back three steps from the 
      Altar, and humbling himself before he begins?</p>
      <p>[pg. 125]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the prostrating of Christ in the 
      garden, when he began his passion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the priest bow himself again at the <i>Confiteor</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To move the people to humiliation; and to signify that by 
      the merits and passion of Christ, (which they are there to commemorate) 
      salvation may be had, if it be sought with a contrite and humble heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth he beat his breast as <i>Mea Culpa</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To teach the people to return into the heart, and 
      signifies that all sin is from the heart, and ought to be discharged from 
      the heart, with hearty sorrow.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the priest, ascending to the Altar, kiss it in 
      the middle?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the Altar signifies the church, composed of divers 
      people, as of divers living stones, which Christ kissed in the middle, by 
      giving a holy kiss of peace and unity, both to the <i>Jews </i>and <i>
      Gentiles.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What signifies the <i>Introit</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is, as it were, the entrance into the office, or that 
      which the priest saith first after his coming to the Altar, and signifies 
      the desires and groanings of the ancient fathers longing for the coming 
      Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Introit</i> repeated twice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the frequent repetition of their desires and 
      supplications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we add unto the <i>Introit, Gloria Patri, </i>&amp;c. 
      glory be to the Father, &amp;c. <i>Amen</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To render thanks to the most Blessed Trinity for our 
      redemption, accomplished by the cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Kyrie Eleison</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies, &quot;Lord have mercy on us,&quot; and is repeated 
      thrice in honour of the Son, and thrice in honour of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why so often?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify our great necessity, and earnest desires to 
      find mercy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. It signifies, &quot;Glory be to God on high;&quot; and is the song 
      which the angels sung at the birth of Christ, used in this place to 
      signify, that the mercy which we</p>
      <p>[pg. 126]</p>
      <p>beg, was brought us by the birth and death of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Oremus</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies, &quot;Let us pray;&quot; and is the priest's address 
      to the people, by which he invites them to join with him, both in his 
      prayer and intention.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Collect</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the priest's prayer, and is called a Collect, 
      because it collects and gathers together the supplications of the 
      multitude, speaking them all with one voice and also because it is a 
      collection, or sum of the <i>Epistle </i>and <i>Gospel, </i>for the most 
      part of the year, especially of all the <i>Sundays.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. Why doth the clerk say, <i>Amen.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. He doth it in the name of the people, to 
      signify, that all concur with the priest, in his petition of prayer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the <i>Dominus Vobiscum</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies, &quot;Our Lord be with you,&quot; and is used to beg 
      God's presence and assistance to the people, in the performance of that 
      work.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it answered <i>Et cum Spiritu tuo, </i>&quot;and with 
      thy spirit?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, that the people with one consent do beg the 
      like for him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are all the prayers ended with <i>Per Dominum nostrum 
      Jesum Christum, </i>&amp;c. &quot;Through our Lord Jesus Christ?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, that whatsover we beg of God the Father, we 
      must beg it in the name of Jesus Christ, by whom he hath given us all 
      things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the <i>Epistle</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the old law; as also the preaching of the 
      Prophets and the Apostles, out of whom it is commonly taken: and it is 
      read before the Gospel, to intimate that the old law being able to bring 
      nothing to perfection, it was necessary the new should succeed it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Gradual</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the penance preached by St. <i>John Baptist,
      </i>and that we cannot obtain the salvation of Christ, but by the holy 
      degrees of penance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Alleluiah</i>?</p>
      <p>[pg. 127]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the voice of men rejoicing, and aspiring to 
      the joys of heaven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Alleluiah </i>repeated so often at the feast 
      of <i>Easter</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is the joyful solemnity of our Saviour's 
      resurrection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why between the <i>Septuagesima </i>and <i>Easter, </i>is 
      the <i>Tract&nbsp;</i> read in the place of the <i>Gradual</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is a time of penance and mourning, and 
      therefore the <i>Tract&nbsp;</i> is read with a mournful and slow voice, to 
      signify the miseries and punishments of this life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the <i>Tract</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Two or three versicles between the Epistle and the Gospel, 
      sung with a slow, long protracted tone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we rise up at the reading of the <i>Gospel</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify our readiness to go, and do, whither, and 
      whatsoever it commands us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Gospel</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the preaching of Christ; and is the happy 
      embassy or message of Christ unto the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Gospel</i> read at the North end, or left 
      side of the Altar?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that by the preaching of the Gospel of Christ, 
      the kingdom of the Devil was overthrown.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How prove you that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the Devil hath chosen the North (figuratively 
      infidels, and the wicked) for the seat of his malice. &quot;From the North 
      shall all evil be opened upon all the inhabitants of the land.&quot; <i>Jer.
      </i>i. 14. and <i>Zach. </i>ii. 7.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the priest before he begins the Gospel, salute 
      the people with <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To prepare them for a devout hearing of it, and to beg of 
      our Lord to make them worthy hearers of his word, which can save their 
      souls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then doth he say, <i>Sequentia sancti Evangelii, </i>
      &amp;c. The sequel of the Holy Gospel, &amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To move attention, and to signify what part of the Gospel 
      he then reads.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the clerk answer, <i>Gloria tibi Domine, </i>
      Glory be to thee, O Lord?</p>
      <p>[pg. 128]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To give the glory of the gospel to God, who hath 
      of his mercy made us partakers of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then doth the priest sign the book with the sign of 
      the cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that the doctrine there delivered, appertains 
      to the cross and passion of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after this do both priest and people sign themselves 
      with the cross in three places?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They sign themselves on their foreheads, to signify they 
      are not, nor will be ashamed to profess Christ crucified: on their mouths 
      to signify they will be ready with their mouths, to confess unto 
      salvation: and on their breast to signify that with their hearts they 
      believe unto justice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why at the end of the Gospel, do they sign their breast 
      again with the sign of the cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That the Devil may not steal the seed of God's word out of 
      their hearts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the Creed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a public profession of out faith, and the wholesome 
      fruit of preaching the Gospel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the first offertory, where the priest offers 
      bread and wine mingled with water?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the freedom wherewith Christ offered himself 
      in his whole life unto his passion, and the desire he had to suffer for 
      our sins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the mingling of water with wine?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the blood and water flowing from the side of 
      Christ; as also the union of the faithful with Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then doth the priest wash the ends of his fingers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To admonish both himself and the people to wash away the 
      unclean thoughts of their hearts, that so they may partake of that clean 
      sacrifice: As also to signify, that the priest is, ought to be clean from 
      mortal sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then after some silence, doth he begin the preface 
      with an elevated voice, saying <i>Per omnia sæcula&nbsp;</i> <i>sæculorum</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the triumphant entry of Christ into <i>
      Jerusalem</i>, after he had lain hid a little space; and</p>
      <p>[pg. 129]</p>
      <p>therefore it is ended with <i>Hosana, benedictus qui venit, </i>&amp;c. 
      which was the <i>Hebrew </i>children's song.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What else meaneth the preface?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a preparation of the people, for the approaching 
      action of the sacrifice; and therefore the priest saith, <i>Sursum corda,
      </i>lift your hearts to God; so to move them to lay aside all earthly 
      thoughts, and to think only on heavenly things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why at these words, <i>Benedictus qui venit, </i>Blessed 
      is he that cometh in our Lord's name, doth he sign himself with the sign 
      of the cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that the entry of Christ into <i>Jerusalem </i>
      was not to a kingdom of this world, but to a death upon the cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the <i>Canon</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a most sacred, essential, and substantial part of 
      the mass, because in it the sacrifice is effected.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Canon </i>read with a low voice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the sadness in our Saviour's passion, which is 
      there effectually represented.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why doth the priest begin the <i>Canon</i> bowing his 
      head?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the obedience of Christ unto his Father in 
      making himself a sacrifice to sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the <i>Te-igitur, clementissime Pater, </i>
      &amp;c. Thee therefore, O most clement Father, &amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a humble and devout supplication to God our heavenly 
      Father, made in the name of all the people, that he would vouchsafe to 
      accept and bless the sacrifice which we are offering unto him for the 
      peace, unity and conversation of the whole Catholic Church, and likewise 
      for the Pope, our prelate, and all the other the truly faithful.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why in the middle of this prayer doth the priest kiss the 
      altar, and sign the Host and Chalice thrice with the sign of the cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He kisseth the altar, to show the kiss of peace which 
      Christ gave us, by reconciling us to God in his own blood. He signeth the 
      Host and Chalice thrice to signify that our redemption made upon the 
      Cross, was done by the will of the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <p>[pg. 130]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the <i>Memento Domine famulorum 
      famularumque tuarum: </i>Remember, O Lord, thy servants, men and women, 
      &amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a commemoration of the living, in which the pries 
      remembers by name, such as he intends chiefly to say mass for, and then in 
      general, all present and all the faithful, beseeching God by virtue of the 
      sacrifice, to bless them, and be mercifully mindful of them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Communicantes and memorum venerantes,
      </i>&amp;c. Communicating and worshipping the memory, &amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is an exercise of our communion with the saints in 
      which having recounted the names of the blessed virgin <i>Mary, </i>and 
      many other glorious saints, we beg of God by their merits and 
      intercession, to grant us the assistance of his protection in all things.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the <i>Hanc igitur oblationem, </i>this 
      offering therefore of our servitude, &amp;c. when the priest spreads his hands 
      over the Host and Chalice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is an earnest begging of God to accept the sacrifice 
      that is presented to be offered for the safety and peace of the whole 
      church, and salvation of all from eternal damnation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then doth he sign the offerings again five times?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the mystery of those five days which were 
      between our Saviour's entry into <i>Jerusalem</i> and his passion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth <i>Qui pridie quam pateretur, </i>who the day 
      before he suffered, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is but a repetition and representation of what Christ 
      did at his last supper, where he took bread, blessed it, &amp;c. and 
      immediately precedes the words of consecration spoken by the priest, by 
      which he sacrificeth to God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the words of consecration?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &quot;<i>Hoc est corpus meum. </i>&amp;c. This is my body; This is 
      the cup of my blood, of the New and eternal Testament; a mystery of faith, 
      which shall be shed for you, and for the many, to the remission of sins.&quot;
      <i>Matt. </i>xxvi. 27, 28.</p>
      <p>[pg. 131]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth these words?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They signify according to the letter, what they effect and 
      cause, <i>viz.</i> a change of the bread and wine into the body and blood 
      of Christ; and in a mystery also they signify, unto us the incarnation, 
      passion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after consecration of the Host, doth the priest kneel 
      and adore?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He kneels and adores, to give sovereign honour to Christ, 
      and signify the real presence of his body and blood in the blessed 
      sacrament which he then holds in his hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after consecration of the wine, doth the priest kneel 
      and adore, saying, <i>Hæc quotiescumque feceritis, </i>&amp;c. that is, &quot;As 
      often as you shall do these things, you shall do them in remembrance of 
      me.&quot; 1 <i>Cor. </i>xi. 25?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. He kneels and adores, to give sovereign honour to Christ, 
      and to signify the real presence of Christ's body and blood in the 
      chalice, then on the altar, and he speaks these words to signify, that as 
      often as we say, or hear mass, and offer up this sacrifice, we must do it 
      as Christ hath commanded us, in memory of his passion, resurrection and 
      ascension: and therefore he goes on, beseeching God by all those 
      mysteries, to look propitiously upon our holy and immaculate host, as he 
      did upon the sacrifices of <i>Abraham, Abel, </i>and <i>Melchisedech, </i>
      and to replenish all that partake thereof, with heavenly grace and 
      benediction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after consecration of each, doth the priest elevate, 
      or lift up the consecrated host and chalice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That all the people may adore the body and blood of 
      Christ, as also to signify, that for our sins his body was lifted on the 
      Cross and his blood shed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what other end doth he elevate the host and chalice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That he, with the whole multitude, may make oblations of 
      Christ's body and blood unto God, which after consecration, is one of the 
      most essential parts of the whole service of the mass, and signifies that 
      oblation, wherewith Christ offered himself unto God upon the altar of the 
      Cross.</p>
      <p>[pg. 132]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then doth he again sign the offerings five 
      times with the sign of the Cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the five wounds of Christ, which he represents 
      to the eternal Father for us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Momento</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a commemoration of the dead; in which the pries 
      first nominates those whom he intends especially to apply the sacrifice 
      unto; and then prays in general for all the faithful departed, beseeching 
      God by virtue of that sacrifice, to give them rest, refreshment, and 
      everlasting life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after the <i>Momento </i>for the dead, doth the priest 
      elevate or raise his voice, saying, <i>Nobis quoqueveccatoribus, </i>&quot;and 
      to us sinners also,&quot; &amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In memory of the supplication of the penitent thief made 
      to Christ on the Cross; that so we also (though unworthy sinners) by the 
      virtue of the sacrifice, may with him and the holy saints, be made 
      partakers of the heavenly kingdom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then doth he again sign the Host and Chalice three 
      times with the sign of the Cross?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, that this sacrifice is available for three 
      sorts of men: for those in heaven, to the increase or glory; for those in 
      purgatory, to free up them from their pains; and for those on earth, to an 
      increase of grace and remission of their sins; as also to signify the 
      three hours which Christ did hang living upon the Cross, and all the 
      griefs he sustained in them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then, uncovering the chalice, doth he sign it five 
      times with the Host?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His uncovering the chalice is to signify, that at the 
      death of Christ the veil of the temple was rent asunder. The three crosses 
      made over the chalice, signify the three hours which Christ hung dead on 
      the cross; the other two made at the brim of the chalice, signifying the 
      blood and water flowing from his side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Pater Noster </i>said with a loud voice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, by the seven petitions thereof, the seven 
      mystical words which Christ spoke upon the Cross with a loud voice, <i>
      viz. </i>&quot;Father, forgive them, they know not what they do. 2. To day 
      shalt thou be</p>
      <p>[pg. 133]</p>
      <p>with me in Paradise. 3. Behold thy mother; woman behold thy son. 4. My 
      God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me. 5. I thirst. 6. Into thy hands I 
      commend my spirit. 7. It is consummated.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the priest laying down the Host upon the 
      corporal, and then covering the chalice again?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the taking of our Saviour down from the 
      Cross, and his burial.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why, then is the priest silent for a time?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify our Saviour's rest in the sepulchre on the 
      Sabbath?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the Host divided into three parts?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the division of our Saviour's soul and body 
      made on the Cross, and that the body was broken, and divided in three 
      principle parts, namely his hands, side, and feet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after this doth he sign the chalice three times with a 
      particle of the Host, and raise his voice saying, <i>Pax Domini, </i>&amp;c., 
      The peace of our Lord be always with you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that the frequent voice of Christ to his 
      disciples, <i>Pax vobis, </i>Peace be to you; as also to signify the 
      triple peace which he hath purchased for us, by his Cross, namely, 
      external, internal, and eternal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then is the particle of the Host put into the chalice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the reuniting of our Saviour's body, blood and 
      soul, made at his resurrection; as also to signify, that we cannot partake 
      of the blood and merits of Christ, unless we partake of his cup of 
      sufferings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Agnus Dei, </i>or Lamb of God, which taketh 
      away the sins of the world, said with a loud voice?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To commemorate the glory of our Saviour's ascension, and 
      to signify that he was slain like an innocent lamb to take away our sins 
      and give us peace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the <i>Pax, </i>or kiss of peace, given before 
      communion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify, that peace and mutual charity, which ought to 
      be among the faithful, who all eat of one bread and of the Eucharist and 
      are all members of one mystical body.</p>
      <p>[pg. 134]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the three prayers said by the priest 
      before the communion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are said in honour of the blessed Trinity. In the 
      first he begs peace for the whole church, and perfect charity among all 
      Christians. In the second, he beseecheth God, by the body and blood of 
      Christ, (which he is there about to receive) to free him from all evil. In 
      the third, that it may not prove to his damnation and judgment, by an 
      unworthy receiving of it, but to the defence and safety of his soul and 
      body. And this immediately precedes the consummation of the Host and 
      Chalice, which is another of the most essential parts of the whole service 
      of the mass.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the consummation of communion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies Christ's burial, and the consummation of his 
      passion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Domine non sum dignus, </i>&amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies, &quot;O Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest 
      enter under my roof; but only say the word,&quot; &amp;c. And it was the <i>
      Centurion's </i>prayer, by which he obtained health for the sick boy, <i>
      Matt. </i>viii. 8. And teacheth us not to approach this sacrifice, but 
      with an humble and contrite heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the prayers said by the priest after communion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are thanksgiving to God for having made us partakers 
      of his unbloody sacrifice of the Altar, and by it also of the bloody 
      sacrifice of the Cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the words <i>Ite Missa est</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They signify, that the Host is offered, Mass ended, and 
      the people dismissed; representing the voice of the angel dismissing the 
      apostles and disciples when they stood looking up after Christ ascended 
      into heaven, with, &quot;O ye men of <i>Galilee</i>, why stand you here looking 
      up into heaven?&quot; <i>Acts </i>i. 11.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the priest lifting up his hands and blessing 
      the people?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies the blessing which Christ gave his apostles 
      and disciples at his ascension, with his hands lifted up.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the Gospel of St. <i>John?</i><br>

      gospel to all nations. <i>Luke </i>xxiv. 50.<br>

      contained.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Primer or Office of our Blessed Lady, Expounded.</i> 
      &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HO composed this office?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The church, directed by the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the Primer so called?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From the Latin word <i>Primo,</i> which signifies, first 
      of all, so to teach us, that prayer should be the first work of the day, 
      according to that, &quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven, and all these 
      things shall be given you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the office divided into Hymns, Psalms, Canticles, 
      Antiphons, Versicles, Responsories, and Prayers?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. For order, beauty, and variety sake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What warrant have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Col. </i>iii. 16. &quot;Sing ye in your hearts unto 
      the Lord in spiritual Psalms, Hymns, and Canticles.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why should the laity pray out of the Psalms, which they 
      little understand?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. 1. Because, by so doing, they pray out of the mouth of the 
      Holy Ghost. 2. Because, if they do it with devout and humble hearts, it is 
      as meritorious in them, as in the greatest scholars; for a petition hath 
      the same force, whether it be delivered by a learned or unlearned man; so 
      hath also prayer. 3. Because a psalm is of the same value in the sight of 
      God, in the mouth of a child, or woman, as from the mouth of the most 
      learned doctor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the office divided into seven several hours?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That so it might be a daily memorial of the seven 
      principal parts, and seven hours of our Saviour's passion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What ground have you for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Out of <i>Zac. </i>xii 10. &quot;At that day I will pour</p>
      <p>[pg. 136]</p>
      <p>out upon the house of <i>David, </i>and the inhabitants of <i>
      Jerusalem, </i>the spirit of grace and prayer, and they shall look up at 
      him whom they have pierced.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth <i>at that day</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The day of grace, <i>the new law.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What means the house of <i>David, </i>and the 
      inhabitants of <i>Jerusalem?</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. The church of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the spirit of grace and prayer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Holy Ghost which dictated the office, and poureth 
      forth the grace of God into our souls by virtue of it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means, &quot;And they shall look up at him whom they have 
      pierced?&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies that the whole order, scope, and object of 
      the office should be Christ crucified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How are the seven hours a memorial of the passion of 
      Christ?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the seven hours were consumed in his passion; for 
      three hours he hung living on the Cross; other three hours he hung dead 
      upon it; and the seventh hour was spent in nailing him to and taking him 
      from the cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do we commemorate by the <i>Matins</i> and <i>Lauds</i>?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The scoffs and indignations which he sustained, whilst 
      they led him through the streets early in the morning to the princes of 
      the <i>Jews; </i>as also the false accusations which then were brought 
      against him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What by the third hour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His whipping at the pillar, his crowning with thorns, his 
      clothing with a purple garment, his sceptre of a reed, and showing to the 
      people with these words: <i>Behold the man.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What by the sixth hour?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His unjust condemnation to death, his carrying the Cross, 
      his stripping and nailing to the Cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What by the ninth hour?</p>
      <p>[pg. 137]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His drinking gall and vinegar, his 
      dying on the Cross, and the opening his side with a spear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What by the even-song?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. His taking down from the Cross, and the darkness which was 
      made upon the face of the earth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What by the <i>Complin</i>?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To dedicate the office of our Lady, and to beg her aid for 
      the devout performance of it to God's honour.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we begin every hour with, <i>Incline unto my aid, O 
      God: O Lord, make haste to help me?</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. To acknowledge our infirmity and misery, and 
      out great need of divine assistance, not only in all other things, but 
      also in our very prayers; according to that of the Apostles, &quot;No man can 
      say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Ghost.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we add to this, Glory be to the Father, and to the 
      Son, and to the Holy Ghost?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that the intention of the office is, in the 
      first place, to give one and equal glory to the most blessed Trinity, and 
      to invite all creatures to do the like, this is the principle aim of the 
      whole office; therefore we not only begin every hour, but also end every
      <i>Psalm</i> with the same verse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Who ordained the <i>Gloria Patri</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The Apostles, according to <i>Baronius </i>in his 3d Tome.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we join unto the Gloria Patri, <i>Sicut erat, </i>
      &amp;c. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without 
      end?</p>
      <p>[pg. 138]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it was made by the Council of <i>Nice </i>against 
      the <i>Arians</i>, who denied Christ to be coequal and consubstantial to 
      his Father, or to have been before the blessed Virgin <i>Mary.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why after this, for a great part of the year, and 
      especially between Easter and Whitsuntide, do we say, Alleluia, Alleluia?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because that is a time of joy, and Alleluia is a <i>Hebrew</i> 
      word, signifying, &quot;Praise ye the Lord with all joy, and exultation of 
      heart.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why were it not better changed into <i>English</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is the language of the blessed in heaven, 
      according to <i>Apoc. </i>viii. 6. Therefore the church hath forbidden it 
      to be translated into any other language.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why in Lent, and some other times, do we say, instead of 
      Alleluiah, &quot;Praise be to thee, O Lord, King of eternal Glory?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because those are times of penance; therefore God must be 
      praised rather with tears, than exaltation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why then do we always say, for the invitatory Hail <i>
      Mary, </i>full of grace, the Lord is with thee?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To congratulate and renew the memory of our blessed Lady's 
      joy, conceived at the conception of her Son Jesus; and to invite both men 
      and angels to do the like.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signify the five verses following the invitatory, 
      which begin, <i>Come let us exult unto our Lord</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The five wounds of Christ, from which all our prayer hath 
      its force and merit, and in honour of which all those versions are said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What mean the Hymns?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are a poetical expression of prerogatives and praises 
      of the Blessed Virgin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are so many Psalms used in the office?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are directed by the Holy Ghost, and do 
      contain in a most moving manner, all the affections of piety and devotion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are there but three Psalms in the most of the hours?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. In honour of the most blessed Trinity, to whom chiefly the 
      whole office is addressed.</p>
      <p>[pg. 139]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why was the office divided into so many hours?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. I have told you the chief reason already, and one other 
      reason is, that so there might be no hour either by day or night, to which 
      some hour of the office might not correspond.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do the matins correspond to?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To the first, second, and third watch of the night, 
      consisting of three hours each; and therefore the matins consist of three 
      psalms, and three lessons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do the lauds correspond to?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To the fourth watch of the night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do the prime, the third, sixth, and ninth hours 
      correspond to?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To the third, sixth, and ninth hours of the day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What do the even-song and complin correspond to?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To the evening.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the benedictions, or blessings given before the 
      lesson?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are short aspirations to beg divine assistance; and 
      the first is in honour of the Father, and the second in honour of the Son, 
      the third in honour of the Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What doth the lesson contain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The mystical praises of our blessed Lady, taken out of the 
      Prophets.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we end every lesson, saying, But thou, O Lord, have 
      mercy upon us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To beg the praises and virtues of the blessed Virgin, 
      which we have there read, may be deeply settled in our hearts, and that 
      God would pardon our former negligence, both in his and her service.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is it answered, Thanks be to God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To render thanks to God for his mercy, in bestowing such a 
      patroness on us as the blessed Virgin <i>Mary.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What means the responsories?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are so called, because they answer one another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the antiphons?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The versicles which are begun before the Psalms.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why do we stand up at the <i>Magnificat, Benedictus, </i>
      and <i>Nunc dimittis</i>?</p>
      <p>[pg. 140]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify our reverence to the gospel whence 
      they are taken.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the collect?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a prayer, and is so called, because it collects and 
      gathers together all the petitions and supplications of the whole office.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the collect always ended with these words, <i>
      Through our Lord Jesus Christ, </i>&amp;c.?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that he is our only mediator of redemption, and 
      principally mediator of intercession; and that we cannot merit any thing 
      by our prayers unless we make them in his name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why make we a commemoration of the Saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To praise God in his Saints, according to the advice of 
      the Psalmist, <i>Psalm </i>cl., and to recommend ourselves to their merits 
      and prayers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why end we every prayer with these words, <i>And may the 
      souls of the faithful, through the mercy of God, rest in peace</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That the poor souls in purgatory, may be partakers of all 
      our prayers and supplications.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the whole office ended with some hymn or antiphon 
      to our Lady?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That by her it may be presented to her Son, and by him to 
      his eternal Father.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the nocturns in some offices so called?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because those parts of the offices were wont to be said <i>
      Nocturne tempore, </i>in the night time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the fifteen gradual psalms so called?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. From a custom the Jews observed of singing them, as they 
      ascended up fifteen steps or degrees (in Latin <i>Gradus</i>) towards <i>
      Solomon's </i>Temple, singing one psalm on every step.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the penitential psalms so called?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they contain many deep expressions of inward 
      sorrow and penitence, or repentance of sins committed, and many cries or 
      supplications to God for mercy and forgiveness.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>The Solemnities of CHRIST our Lord,<br>
      (instituted for the most part by the Apostles)<br>
      and the Sundays of the Year, expounded.</i></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT meaneth 
      the nativity of Christ, or Christmas?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a solemn feast or mass yearly celebrated by the 
      whole Catholic Church from the Apostles' time to this day, in memory of 
      the birth of Christ at <i>Bethlehem;&nbsp;</i> and therefore is called the 
      feast of the Nativity, and Christmas from the mass of the birth of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the Circumcision or New-year's Day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a feast in memory of the Circumcision of our Lord, 
      which was made on the eighth day from his nativity according to the 
      prescript of the old law, <i>Gen. </i>xviii. 12, when he was named <i>
      Jesus </i>according to what the angel had foretold, <i>Luke </i>i. 14, and 
      began to shed his infant blood by the stony knife of Circumcision for the 
      redemption of the world, presenting it to his Father, as a New-year's gift 
      in our behalf. And it is called New year's day from the old <i>Roman </i>
      account, who began their computation of the year from the first of <i>
      January.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the Epiphany, or twelfth day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a solemnity in memory and honour of Christ's 
      manifestation or apparition made to the Gentiles by a miraculous blazing 
      star, by virtue whereof he drew and conducted three kings out of the <i>
      East </i>to adore him in the manager, where they presented him as on this 
      day with <i>gold, myrrh, </i>and <i>frankincense, </i>in testimony of his 
      regality, humanity, and divinity. The word <i>Epiphany </i>comes from the
      <i>Greek, </i>and signifies a manifestation, and is called Twelfth-day, 
      because it is celebrated the twelfth day after his nativity exclusively.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth purification or Candlemass-day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a feast in memory and honour both of the 
      presentation of our blessed Lord, and of the purification of the blessed 
      Virgin, made in the Temple of <i>Jerusalem </i>the fortieth day after her 
      happy child birth, according to the law of <i>Moses, Levit. </i>xii. 6. 
      And is called the Pu-</p>
      <p>[pg. 142]</p>
      <p>rification, from the Latin word <i>Purifico, </i>to purify; not that 
      our blessed Lady and contracted any thing by her child-birth, which needed 
      purifying, (being the mother of purity itself) but because other mothers 
      were by this ceremonial rite freed from the legal impurity of their 
      child-births.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is also called <i>Candlemass, </i>or a <i>Mass Candles;
      </i>because before the mass of that day, the church blesses her candles 
      for the whole year, and makes a procession with hallowed candles in the 
      hands of the faithful, in memory of divine light, wherewith Christ 
      illuminated the whole church at his presentation, where aged <i>Simeon </i>
      styled him, &quot;A light to the Revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of 
      his people <i>Israel.</i>&quot; <i>Luke </i>ii. 32.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the resurrection of our Lord, or Easter-day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a solemnity in memory and honour of our Saviour's 
      resurrection, or rising from the dead on the third day, <i>Matt. </i>
      xxvii. 6. And is called <i>Easter</i>, from <i>Oriens, </i>which signifies 
      the <i>East </i>or <i>Rising, </i>which is one of the titles of Christ, 
      &quot;And his name (saith the prophet) shall be called <i>Oriens.</i>&quot; <i>Zach.
      </i>vi. 12, because as the material sun daily ariseth from the East, the 
      sun of justice, at this day, arose from the dead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth ascension-day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. If is from a feast in memory of Christ's ascension into 
      heaven the fortieth day after his resurrection, in the sight of his 
      Apostles and Disciples, <i>Acts </i>i. 9, 10, there to prepare a place for 
      us, being preceded by whole legions of Angels, and waited on by millions 
      of Saints, whom he had freed out of the prison of <i>Limbo. Mich. </i>ii. 
      13.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth <i>Pentecost </i>or <i>Whitsuntide</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a solemn feast in memory and honour of the coming of 
      the Holy Ghost upon the heads of the Apostles, in tongues as it were of 
      fire, <i>Acts </i>ii. 3. <i>Pentecost </i>in Greek signifieth the <i>
      Fiftieth, </i>it being the fiftieth day after the resurrection. If is also 
      called <i>Whitsunday </i>from the <i>Catechumens, </i>who were clothed in 
      white, and admitted on the eve of this feast to the sacrament of baptism. 
      It was anciently called <i>Wied Sunday, (i.e.)</i></p>
      <p>[pg. 143]</p>
      <p><i>Holy Sunday, </i>for <i>wied </i>or <i>withed </i>signifies Holy in 
      the old <i>Saxon</i> language.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth Trinity Sunday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the octave of Whitsunday, and is so called in honour 
      of the Blessed Trinity, to signify that the works of our redemption and 
      sanctification then completed, are common to all the three persons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth <i>Corpus Christi </i>day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a feast instituted by the church, in honour of the 
      body and blood of Christ, really present in the most holy sacrament of the 
      Eucharist; during the octave of which feast, it is exposed to be adored by 
      the faithful in all the principle churches of the world, and great 
      processions are made in honour of it; and therefore is called <i>Corpus 
      Christi day, </i>or the day of the body of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the transfiguration of our Lord?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a feast in memory of our Saviour's transfiguring 
      himself upon Mount<i> Tabor</i>, and showing a glimpse of his glory to his 
      Apostles, St. <i>Peter, </i>St. <i>James, </i>and St. <i>John. </i>&quot;And 
      his face (saith the text) shown as the sun, and his garment became white 
      as snow,&quot; &amp;c. <i>Matt.</i> xvii. 2. And in them also unto us, for our 
      encouragement to virtue, and perseverance in his holy faith and love. The 
      entymology is obvious from <i>transfiguro</i>, to transfigure, or to 
      change shape.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is <i>Sunday, </i>or the Lord's Day in general?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a day dedicated by the Apostles to the honour of the 
      most holy Trinity, and in memory that Christ our Lord arose from the&nbsp; 
      dead upon <i>Sunday, </i>sent down the holy Ghost on a <i>Sunday, </i>&amp;c. 
      and therefore is called the Lord's Day. It is also called <i>Sunday </i>
      from the old <i>Roman</i> denomination of <i>Dies Solis, </i>the day of 
      the sun, to which it was sacred.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the four Sundays of Advent?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are the four Sundays preceding <i>Christmas day, </i>
      and were so called by the church, in memory and honour of our Saviour's 
      coming both to redeem the world by his birth in the flesh, and to judge 
      the quick and the dead; from the Latin word <i>Adventus, </i>which 
      signifies Advent, or coming.</p>
      <p>[pg. 144]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are the four Sundays of <i>Septuagesima, Sexagesima, 
      Quinquagesiam, </i>and <i>Quadragesima</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Those days are appointed by the church for acts of penance 
      and mortification, and are a certain gradation or preparation for the 
      passion and resurrection of Christ, being so called, because the first is 
      the seventieth, the second the sixtieth, the third the fiftieth, the 
      fourth the fortieth day, or thereabouts, preceding the octave of the 
      resurrection according as their several names import.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the whole lent called <i>Quadragesima</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it is a fast of forty days, in imitation of 
      Christ's fasting in the desert forty days and forty nights, and is begun 
      the fortieth day before <i>Easter</i>, which is therefore called <i>
      Quadragesima, </i>or the fortieth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is Passion-Sunday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That is a feast so called from the passion of Christ then 
      drawing nigh, and was ordained to prepare us for a worthy celebrating of 
      it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is Palm-Sunday so called?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a day in memory and honour of the triumphant entry 
      of our Lord into <i>Jerusalem</i>, and is so called from the palm 
      branches, which the <i>Hebrew </i>children strewed under his feet, crying
      <i>Hosanna to the Son of David, Matt. </i>xxi. 15. And hence it is that 
      yearly, as on that day, the church blesseth Palms, and makes a solemn 
      procession in honour of the same triumph, all the people bearing Palm 
      branches in their hands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is <i>Dominica in albis, </i>commonly called 
      Low-Sunday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is the octave of Easter-day; and is so called from the
      <i>Catechumens, </i>or <i>Neophytes, </i>who were on that day solemnly 
      divested in the church of their white garments.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp; <i>The Feasts of our Blessed Lady, and the 
      Saints, Expounded.</i> &nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT means the conception, 
      nativity, presentation, annunciation, visitation, and assumption of our 
      blessed Lady?</p>
      <p>[pg. 145]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are feasts instituted by the church in 
      memory and honour of the mother of God, but chiefly to the honour of God 
      himself; and so are all the other feasts of Saints.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. How explain you that answer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The feast of the <i>Conception </i>is in memory of her 
      miraculous conception, who was conceived by her parents, <i>St. Joachim
      </i>and <i>St. Anne, </i>in their old age, and sanctified from the first 
      instant in the womb. The <i>Nativity </i>is in the memory of her happy and 
      glorious birth, by whom the author of all life and salvation was born to 
      the world. The <i>Presentation, </i>in memory of her being present in the 
      Temple at three years old, where she vowed herself to God, both soul and 
      body. The <i>Annunciation </i>is in memory of that most happy embassy 
      brought to her by the angel <i>Gabriel </i>from God, in which she was 
      declared to be the mother of God, <i>Luke </i>i. 31, 32. The <i>Visitation
      </i>is in memory of her visiting St. Elizabeth, after she had conceived 
      the Son of God, at whose presence St. <i>John </i>the Baptist leaped in 
      his mother's womb, <i>Luke </i>i. 41. And her <i>Assumption </i>is in 
      memory of her being assumed or taken up into heaven, both soul and body, 
      after her dissolution or dormition; which is a pious and well-founded 
      tradition in the church.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what end are the several solemnities of Saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. They are instituted by our holy mother the church, to 
      honour God in his Saints, and to teach us to imitate their several kinds 
      of martyrdoms and sufferings for the faith of Christ, as also their 
      several ways of virtue and perfection: as the zeal, charity, and poverty 
      of the Apostles and Evangelists; the fortitude of the martyrs the 
      constancy of the confessors; the purity and humility of the virgins, &amp;c.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the feast of St. <i>Peter's </i>installing 
      and erecting his apostolical chair in the city of <i>Antioch.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. It is kept in memory of St. <i>Peter's </i>
      installing and erecting his apostolical chair in the city of <i>Antioch.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What is the feast of his chair at Rome?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a solemnity in honour of the translation of his 
      chair from <i>Antioch </i>to <i>Rome.</i></p>
      <p>[pg. 146]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are St. <i>Peter </i>and St. <i>Paul </i>
      joined in one solemnity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because they are principle and joint co-operators under 
      Christ in the conversion of the world, St. <i>Peter </i>converting the <i>
      Jews, </i>and St. <i>Paul, </i>the <i>Gentiles; </i>as also because both 
      of them were martyred at he same place <i>Rome, </i>and on the same day,
      <i>June </i>29.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the feast of St. <i>Peter and Vincula, </i>or
      <i>St. Peter's Chains</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It in in honour of those chains wherewith <i>Herod </i>
      bound St. <i>Peter </i>in <i>Jerusalem, </i>and from which he was freed by 
      an angel of God, <i>Acts </i>xii. by only the touch whereof great miracles 
      were afterwards effected; to say nothing of their miraculous joining 
      together many years after into one chain, with those iron fetters, with 
      which they had been imprisoned in <i>Rome.</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth the feast of <i>Michaelmas?</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. It is a solemnity or solemn mass in honour of 
      St. <i>Michael</i>, prince of the heavenly host, and likewise of all the 
      nine orders of holy angels; as well to commemorate that famous battle 
      fought by him and them in heaven, against the dragon and his apostate 
      angels, <i>Apoc. </i>xii. 7. in defence of God's honour; as also to 
      commend the whole church of God to their patronage and prayers. And it is 
      called the dedication of St. <i>Michael, </i>by reason of a church in <i>
      Rome, </i>dedicated on that day to St. <i>Michael, </i>by Pope <i>
      Boniface.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>There is another feast called the apparition of 
      St. <i>Michael</i>, and is in memory of his miraculous apparition on Mount
      <i>Garganus, </i>where by his own appointment, a temple was dedicated to 
      him in Pope <i>Gelasius' </i>time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. For what reason hath the holy church ordained a solemnity 
      in memory of all the Saints?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That so at least we might obtain the prayers and patronage 
      of them all, seeing the whole year is much too short to afford us a 
      particular feast for every Saint.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth All Souls Day?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a day instituted by the church, in memory of all the 
      faithful departed, that by the prayers and suffrages of the living, they 
      may be freed out of their purgatory pains, and come to everlasting rest.</p>
      <p>[pg. 147]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means Shrove-tide?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It signifies a time of confession; for our ancestors were 
      used to say, <i>we will go to the shrift, </i>instead of we will go to 
      confession, and in the more primitive times all good Christians went to 
      confession, the better to prepare themselves for a holy observation of <i>
      Lent</i>, and worthy receiving the blessed sacrament at <i>Easter.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What signifies Ash-Wednesday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a day of public penance and humiliation in the whole 
      church of God, and is so called from the ceremony of blessing ashes on 
      that day, wherewith the priest signeth the people, with a cross on their 
      foreheads, giving them this wholesome admonition, <i>Memento homo, </i>&amp;c.
      <i>Remember man that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return. </i>So 
      to prepare them for the holy fast of Lent, and passion of Christ.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means <i>Maundy Thursday</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. That is a feast in memory of our Lord's last supper, where 
      he instituted the blessed Eucharist, or sacrament of his precious body and 
      blood, and washed his disciples' feet; and it is called <i>Maundy 
      Thursday, </i>as it were mandatum or mandat Thursday from the first word 
      of the Antiphon, mandatum novum de vobis, &amp;c. <i>John </i>xiii. 34. &quot;I 
      give unto you a new command, (or mandat) that you love one another, as I 
      have loved you;&quot; which is sing on that day in the churches, when the 
      prelates begin the ceremony of washing their people's feet, in imitation 
      of Christ's washing his disciple's feet, before he instituted the blessed 
      sacrament.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth Good-Friday?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a most sacred and memorable day of which the great 
      good work of our redemption was consummated by Christ on his bloody cross.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the three days of Tenebræ, before Easter?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a mournful solemnity, in which the church laments 
      the death of Christ; and is called Tenebræ or darkness, to signify the 
      darkness which overspread the face of the earth, at the time of his 
      passion, for which</p>
      <p>[pg. 148]</p>
      <p>end also the church extinguisheth all her lights, and after some 
      silence, at the end of the whole office, maketh a great and sudden noise, 
      to represent the rending the veil of the Temple. The darkness also 
      signifies the dark time of the night wherein Christ was apprehended in the 
      garden, and the noise made by the soldiers and catch-poles at their 
      seizing on our Saviour's person.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What meaneth Rogation week, being the fifth after Easter?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. It is a week of public prayer and confession for the 
      temperateness of the seasons of the year, and the fruitfulness of the 
      earth, and it is called Rogation from the verb <i>Roga, </i>to <i>ask </i>
      by reason of the petitions made to God in that behalf.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the <i>Quatuor tempora, </i>or four Ember 
      weeks, or Ember Days?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Those are times also of public prayer, fasting, and 
      processions partly instituted for the successful ordination of the priest 
      and ministers of the church, and partly, both to beg and render thanks to 
      God for the fruits and blessings of the earth. And are called <i>Ember 
      days, </i>or <i>days of Ashes, </i>from the no less ancient than religious 
      custom of using hair-cloth and ashes, in time of public prayer and 
      penance; or from the old custom of eating nothing on those days till 
      night, and then only a cake baked under the embers or ashes, which was 
      called, <i>Panis, subcineritius, </i>or <i>Ember bread.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. What mean the two <i>Holy Rood Days?</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. Those are two ancient feasts: the one in 
      memory of the miraculous invention, or finding out the holy cross by <i>
      St. Helen, </i>mother of <i>Constantine </i>the great, after it had been 
      hid and buried by the Infidels one hundred and eighty years, who had 
      erected a statue of <i>Venus</i> in the place of it. The other in memory 
      of the exaltation, or setting up the holy cross by <i>Heraclius</i> the 
      emperor, who having regained it a second time from the <i>Persians</i>, 
      after it had been lost fourteen years, carried it on his own shoulders to 
      Mount <i>Calvary, </i>and there exalted it with great solemnity; and it is 
      called <i>Holy Rood, </i>or <i>Holy Cross, </i>for the great sanctity 
      which</p>
      <p>[pg. 149]</p>
      <p>it received by touching and bearing the oblation of the most precious 
      body of Christ; the word <i>Rood </i>in the old <i>Saxon </i>tongue, 
      signifying Cross.<br>

      <p align="center"><i>Some Ceremonies of the Church Expounded.</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. <font size="+2">W</font>HAT is holy water?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A water sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 1 <i>
      Tim. </i>iv. 5, in order to certain spiritual effects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. what are those effects?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The chief are, 1. To make us mindful of our baptism, by 
      which we entered into Christ's mystical body, and therefore we are taught 
      to sprinkle ourselves with it as often as we enter the material Temple 
      (which is a type thereof to celebrate his praise.) 2. To fortify against 
      the illusions of evil spirits, against whom it hath great force as 
      witnessed <i>Theodoret, Eccl. Hist. </i>l. 5, c. 31. And hence arose the 
      proverb, <i>He loves it, </i>(speaking of things we hate) <i>as the Devil 
      loves holy water.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. How ancient is the use of Holy water?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Ever since the apostles' time; Pope <i>Alexander </i>I. 
      who was but the fourth Pope from St. <i>Peter, </i>makes mention of it in 
      one of his epistles. <i>Exod. </i>xxxvii. 8., 2 <i>Par. </i>iv. 6.; 4 <i>
      Kings </i>ii. 21.; <i>Ps. </i>I. 9.; <i>Heb. </i>ix. 19.; x. 22; <i>De 
      Cons. Dist. </i>iii. c. 20; <i>B. Greg. Pastor, Pars </i>ii. c. 5.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is incense offered in the church?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To raise in the mind of the people an awe of the 
      mysterious in the action to which it is applied, and to beget a pious 
      esteem of it, as also to signify, that out prayers ought to ascend like a 
      sweet perfume in the sight of God. &quot;Tis mentioned by St. <i>Dionysius, 
      Eccles Hierarch. </i>c. 3.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the cross carried before us in procession?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To show that our pilgrimage in this life is nothing but a 
      following of Christ crucified.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are our foreheads signed with holy ashes on Ash 
      Wednesday?</p>
      <p>[pg. 150]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To remind us of what we are made, and to admonish 
      us to do penance for our sins, as the <i>Ninevites </i>did in fasting, 
      sackcloth, and ashes, especially in the holy time of <i>Lent.</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Q. Who ordained the solemn fast of <i>Lent</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The twelve Apostles, according to <i>Heirom Epist. ad 
      Marcel, </i>in memory and imitation of our Saviour's fasting forty days.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why are the crosses and holy images covered in time of <i>
      Lent</i>?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify that our sins (for which we then do penance) 
      interpose between God and us, and to express an ecclesiastical kind of 
      mourning in reference to our Saviour's passion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is a veil drawn between the altar-piece and the people 
      in Lent time?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To intimate, that, as our sins are as a veil which binder 
      us from seeing the beatific vision, or face of God; and as the veil of the 
      Temple was rent at the death of Christ, so is the veil of our sins by 
      virtue of his cross and passion, if we apply it by worthy fruits of 
      penance.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What means the fifteen lights set on the triangular figure 
      on <i>Wednesday, Thursday, </i>and <i>Friday </i>in holy-week?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. The three upper lights signify <i>Jesus, Mary, </i>and <i>
      Joseph; </i>the twelve lower, the twelve Apostles. The triangular figure 
      signifies, that all light of grace and glory is from the blessed Trinity; 
      and fourteen of those lights are extinguished on by one after every Psalm, 
      to show how all their light of spiritual comfort was extinguished for a 
      time in those most Holy Saints, by the passion and burial of Christ. The 
      fifteenth light is put under the altar to signify his being in the 
      sepulchre, as also the darkness that overspread the whole earth at his 
      death.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What signifies the noise made after a long silence, at the 
      end of the office of <i>Tenebræ?</i><br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A. The silence signifies the horror of our 
      Saviour's death; the noise, the cleaving of the rocks and rending the veil 
      of the Temple which then happened.</p>
      <p>[pg. 151]</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the paschal candle hallowed 
      and set up at Easter?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To signify the new light of the spiritual joy and comfort, 
      which Christ brought us at his resurrection; and it is lighted from the 
      beginning of the Gospel till after the communion, between Easter and 
      Ascension, to signify the apparitions which Christ made to his disciples 
      during that space.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the font hallowed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because the Apostles so ordered it, according to St. <i>
      Dionysius, </i>who lived in their time. 1 <i>Eccl. Hier. </i>c. 2.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is that ceremony performed at the feast of Easter and 
      Whitsuntide?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To show that, as in baptism we are buried with Christ, so 
      by virtue of his resurrection, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, we ought 
      to rise again, and walk with him in newness of life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the material church or temple hallowed?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because it bears a figure of the spiritual, viz. the 
      mystical body of Christ, which is holy and unspotted, <i>Ephes. </i>v. 27. 
      as also to move us to some special reverence and devotion in that place, 
      and all things should be holy in some measure, which appertain to the 
      service of our most Holy God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. Why is the altar consecrated?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Because if the altar in the old law was so holy that it 
      sanctified the gift, <i>Matt. </i>xxiii. 19. much more ought the altar of 
      the new law to be holy, which is the place of the body and blood of 
      Christ, according to <i>Optatus, </i>in his sixth book against <i>
      Parmenian the Donatist. </i>&quot;We have an altar (saith St. <i>Paul</i>) 
      whereof they (the Jews) have no power to eat, who serve the Tabernacle.&quot;
      <i>Heb. </i>xiii. 10.</p>
