<blockquote>
  <p>Pope John Paul II, on the 23rd of October, 1996, while speaking to the 
  Pontifical Academy of Sciences plenary session at the Vatican, declared the 
  evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin to be fact, tacitly acknowledging that 
  man evolved from the apes, and reducing the biblical account of Genesis to 
  that of mere fable!</p>

          <p align="center"><strong>TO ACADEMICIANS: TRUTH CANNOT CONTRADICT 
          TRUTH</strong></p>
          <p align="justify">VATICAN CITY, OCT 23, 1996 (VIS) - In a Message 
          made public today to the members of the Pontifical Academy of 
          Sciences, meeting this week in the Vatican in plenary session, the 
          Holy Father recalled that Pope Pius XI, who restored this academy in 
          1936, called this group of scholars &quot;the Church's 'scientific senate'&quot; 
          and asked them &quot;to serve the truth.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">The Pope expressed delight on the plenary's theme 
          on the origin of life and evolution, &quot;a basic theme which greatly 
          interests the Church, as Revelation contains, for its part, teachings 
          concerning the nature and origins of man.&quot; If the 
          scientifically-reached conclusions and those contained in Revelation 
          on the origin of life seem to counter each other, he said, &quot;in what 
          direction should we seek their solution? We know in effect that truth 
          cannot contradict truth.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">John Paul II, noting the academy's &quot;reflection on 
          science at the dawn of the third millennium,&quot; observed that &quot;in the 
          domain of inanimate and animate nature, the evolution of science and 
          its applications make new questions arise. The Church can grasp their 
          scope all the better as she knows their basic aspects.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">He pointed to the Church's magisterium on the 
          question of the origin of life and evolution, citing in particular 
          Pius XII's 1950 Encyclical &quot;Humani Generis&quot; and the conciliar 
          Constitution &quot;Gaudium et Spes.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">The Pope drew the academicians' attention to &quot;the 
          need for a correct interpretation of the inspired word, of a rigorous 
          hermeneutics. It is fitting to set forth well the limits of the 
          meaning proper to Scripture, rejecting undue interpretations which 
          make it say what it does not have the intention of saying.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;'Humani Generis',&quot; he stated, &quot;considered the 
          doctrine of 'evolutionism' as a serious hypothesis, worthy of a more 
          deeply studied investigation and reflection on a par with the opposite 
          hypothesis. ... Today, more than a half century after this encyclical, 
          new knowledge leads us to recognize in the theory of evolution more 
          than a hypothesis. ... The convergence, neither sought nor induced, of 
          results of work done independently one from the other, constitutes in 
          itself a significant argument in favor of this theory.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">He continued: &quot;The elaboration of a theory such as 
          that of evolution, while obeying the exigency of homogeneity with the 
          data of observation, borrows certain ideas from the philosophy of 
          nature. To tell the truth, more than the theory of evolution, one must 
          speak of the theories of evolution. ... There are thus materialistic 
          and reductionist readings and spiritual readings.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;The magisterium of the Church is directly 
          interested in the question of evolution because this touches upon the 
          concept of man, ... created in the image and likeness of God. ... Pius 
          XII underlined this essential point: 'if the origin of the human body 
          is sought in living matter which existed before it, the spiritual soul 
          is directly created by God.' Consequently, the theories of evolution 
          which, as a result of the philosophies which inspire them, consider 
          the spirit as emerging from forces of living matter or as a simple 
          epiphenomenon of this matter, are incompatible with the truth about 
          man. They are moreover incapable of laying the foundation for the 
          dignity of the person.&quot;</p>
          <p align="justify">&quot;Consideration of the method used in diverse orders 
          of knowledge allows for the concordance of two points of view which 
          seem irreconcilable. The sciences of observation describe and measure 
          with ever greater precision the multiple manifestations of life and 
          place them on a timeline. The moment of passing over to the spiritual 
          is not the object of an observation of this type, which can 
          nevertheless reveal, on an experimental level, a series of very useful 
          signs about the specificity of the human being. But the experience of 
          metaphysical knowledge, of the awareness of self and of its reflexive 
          nature, that of the moral conscience, that of liberty, or still yet 
          the aesthetic and religious experience, are within the competence of 
          philosophical analysis and reflection, while theology extracts from it 
          the final meaning according to the Creator's designs.&quot; <br>

    <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/docs/jp02tc.htm">Full Text of John Paul 
    II's comments on evolution</a> </b>online at New Advent, a Roman Catholic 
    web page. (Note that my comments below are keyed to the original official 
    Vatican press release shown above, not this apparently complete translation 
    of the Pope's remarks, which were delivered in French.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I will address just a few key quotes of John Paul II that were mentioned in 
  the above October 23rd, 1996 Vatican Information Service press release, 
  (article N.182).</p>
  <p>To begin with, in the second paragraph, two sources of &quot;truth&quot; are 
  mentioned, one being the conclusions of modern science, and the other being 
  Revelation of truth from scripture or the church. The Pope stated that</p>
  <p align="center">&quot;We know in effect that the truth cannot contradict the 
  truth.&quot;</p>
  <p>(This is a quote from <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13PROVI.htm">PROVIDENTISSIMUS DEUS</a></b>, 
  Paragraph 23).</p>
  <p>What the Pope has done, as you will see, is elevate Darwinian evolutionary 
  theory to that of undeniable scientific fact, or truth. He then draws the 
  conclusion that since evolution is indeed the truth, the Catholic Church's 
  interpretation of the biblical account of Genesis cannot contradict this now 
  proven and accepted fact of evolution, and so church teachings must 
  consequently be re-evaluated and amended. The Catholic church has faced this 
  sort of predicament before.</p>
  <p>The Pope probably sees parallels between Darwin's theory and the 
  astronomical discoveries of Galileo. In 1632, as a result of his scientific 
  observations, Galileo published a book in which he defended the Copernican 
  theory of a sun-centered solar system. Galileo's &quot;Dialogue on the Great World 
  Systems&quot; was swiftly condemned by Pope Urban VIII, because the church believed 
  and taught that the earth was the center of the universe. Galileo was made to 
  recant his heretical opinions and his book was banned by the church for 
  two-hundred years. It is a classic example of church dogma suppressing 
  scientific truth.</p>
  <p>Here is a Catholic view of <b><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/GALILEO.TXT">The Galileo Affair</a>
  </b>online at EWTN.</p>
  <p>Recently (1979) the Pontifical Academy of Sciences reconsidered the Galileo 
  matter, with Pope John Paul II then acknowledging that the church erred in 
  it's condemning the factual astronomical discoveries of Galileo. So the Pope 
  probably saw a similar fiasco brewing between biblical creationism and 
  evolutionary science. While the astronomical sciences have proved beyond a 
  shadow of a doubt that the earth does indeed revolve around the Sun, the case 
  for evolutionary science has never been proven to be anything but hypothesis, 
  which is to say it is nothing more than speculation. The cases are really 
  quite different, but apparently that is not the opinion of John Paul II.</p>
  <p>In the 5th paragraph of the Vatican press release, the Pope points out-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;the need for a correct interpretation of the inspired word, of a 
    rigorous hermeneutics. It is fitting to set forth well the limits of the 
    meaning proper to scripture, rejecting undue interpretations which make it 
    say what it does not have the intention of saying.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Pope is saying that he is abandoning what he feels is an untenable and 
  &quot;undue&quot; interpretation of the Bible, namely that God created the entire 
  universe, to include man, in a mere 6 days, and he is adopting instead the 
  process of Darwinian evolution which proposes man evolved over millions of 
  years from the apes.</p>
  <p>Note with care what is stated in the 6th paragraph of the Vatican press 
  release. Pope John Paul II says-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot; new knowledge leads us to recognize in the theory of evolution more 
    than a hypothesis.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Either evolution is theory (hypothesis) or it is fact, there is no middle 
  ground with respect to the origin of man. Either God created man directly from 
  the dust of the earth or He didn't. It is just that simple. <b><em>The Pope in 
  the above sentence has just declared evolution to be a fact, and in the 
  process he dismissed the biblical account of Genesis as fable.</em></b></p>
  <p>In the 6th paragraph of the above Vatican press release, an encyclical from 
  Pope Pius XII, HUMANI GENERIS, is summarized and appealed to for support by 
  John Paul II -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Humani Generis',&quot; he stated, &quot;considered the doctrine of 'evolutionism' 
    as a serious hypothesis, worthy of a more deeply studied investigation and 
    reflection on a par with the opposite hypothesis.&quot; (He is commenting on 
    paragraph 36 of the encyclical)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In this summary of Humani Generis, John Paul II has just reduced the 
  biblical six day creation (the opposite hypothesis) to mere theory, and 
  elevated evolutionary science to be on a par with it as an equal possibility 
  to be considered! And that is indeed a correct assessment of what Pius XII 
  said in his encyclical.</p>
  <p>Continuing, in the 8th paragraph of the Vatican press release, John Paul II 
  now quotes the encyclical <b><nobr><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12HUMAN.htm">HUMANI GENERIS</a>
  </nobr></b>(see paragraph 36) -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;if the origin of the human body is sought in living matter which existed 
    before it, the spiritual soul is directly created by God.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, as Pius XII explains it, if man did evolve, the same is not true of the 
  soul. That, he claims, God created directly and put into man. Man himself 
  though, is presumed to have evolved from &quot;pre-existing living matter&quot;, rather 
  than being created by God in one day from the dust of the earth. What Pius XII 
  meant by that is that man evolved from the apes in accord with Darwinian 
  theory!</p>
  <p>What a predicament!! What an embarrassment for Christianity! At a time when 
  the Protestant church in America is fighting to re-introduce the teaching of 
  creationism into the public schools, Pope John Paul II stuns the world and 
  declares Darwin was right after all, and man <em>has</em> descended from the 
  apes! He is dismissing Genesis as fable and actually accepting Darwin's Origin 
  of the Species as fact! Absolutely amazing!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Tim 6:20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, <b>
    avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so 
    called:</b><br>

  <hr>
  <p align="center"><b><u>The Great Translation Debate</u></b></p>
  <p>Something of a debate is swirling around what the Pope actually said, or 
  meant to say.</p>
  <p>The contested passage is quoted here-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Today, almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical, new 
    knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than 
    a hypothesis. It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been 
    progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in 
    various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, 
    of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a 
    significant argument in favor of this theory.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The debate is whether or not the Pope said &quot;the theory of evolution as more 
  than <b>a</b> hypothesis&quot; or &quot;the theory of evolution as more than <b>one</b> 
  hypothesis&quot;. The original French text of the crucial sentence is presented at 
  the New Advent site listed near the top for those who understand it. Some 
  Catholics are scrambling to interpret the Pope's remarks to say that he was 
  merely acknowledging multiple theories of evolution, hence the &quot;more than <em>
  one</em> hypothesis&quot;. However, in context, the Pope is quite clear in his 
  endorsement of evolution as fact. Let me repeat his statement with my 
  notations-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Today, almost half a century after the publication of the encyclical, new 
    knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution [singular 
    theory] as more than a hypothesis. It is indeed remarkable that this theory 
    [of evolution, singular theory] has been progressively accepted by 
    researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of 
    knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of 
    work that was conducted independently is in itself <b><em>a significant 
    argument in favor of this theory</em> </b>[of evolution, singular theory].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The context of the paragraph clearly proposes that various fields of 
  scientific knowledge are converging in support of Darwinian evolution as the 
  mechanism of creation, and the Pope recognizes this convergence of scientific 
  evidence to significantly favor evolution, such that he at least, no longer 
  considers evolution to be just a hypothesis, but rather he accepts it to be 
  fact.</p>

  <p>It would seem that Catholics would rather debate this among themselves, 
  leaving the issue unresolved, rather than ask the Pope for clarification on 
  the issue. Perhaps they feel it is better if he simply remains silent rather 
  than explain and potentially exacerbate the problem by removing all doubt 
  about what he really meant to say.</p>

  fierce debate raging between so-called &quot;creationism&quot; and evolutionism, 
  presented as though they were mutually exclusive alternatives: those who 
  believe in the Creator would not be able to conceive of evolution, and those 
  who instead support evolution would have to exclude God. This antithesis is 
  absurd because, on the one hand, there are so many scientific proofs in favour 
  of evolution which appears to be a reality we can see and which enriches our 
  knowledge of life and being as such. But on the other, the doctrine of 
  evolution does not answer every query, especially the great philosophical 
  question: where does everything come from? And how did everything start which 
  ultimately led to man? I believe this is of the utmost importance. ...</p>

  <hr>
  <p>Apparently most Roman Catholic schools have taught evolution pretty much as 
  fact since Pope Pius XII's encyclical HUMANI GENERIS in 1950. I even have a 
  Catholic acquaintance who confirms that he was taught evolution as fact by 
  Jesuits while in a Catholic school, so to most Catholics the Pope's remarks 
  probably come as no great surprise.</p>
  <p>So can the Catholic accept evolution? Is it compatible with the Bible? 
  Could the Pope be right about evolution? Please continue on to my article <b>
