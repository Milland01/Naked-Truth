        <td width="100%">
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><b>Fiction 5<br>
          </b><i>The pope is the beast spoken of in Revelation 13.
Verse 1 says that he wears crowns and has "blasphemous names" written
on his head. Verse 18 says that the numerical value of his name adds up
to 666. The pope's official title in Latin is Vicarius Filii Dei (Vicar
Son of God). If you add that up using Roman numerals, you get 666. The
pope's tiara is emblazoned with this title, formed by diamonds and
other jewels.boxes</i></p>
          <p align="left">I wasn't very good at math in school, but
even I can follow this argument and run the numbers well enough to show
it's bogus. (Besides, answering this question is apologetics at its
most fun!) The charge that the pope is the beast of Revelation 13,
because his title adds up to 666, is especially popular with
Seventh-Day Adventists, but it's also widely repeated in some
Protestant circles.</p>
          <p align="left">Vicarius Filii Dei does have the mathematical
value of 666 in Latin. Here's how it works. Like many ancient
languages, such as Greek and Hebrew, some Latin letters are also used
for numbers: I = 1, V = 5, X = 10, L = 50, C = 100, D = 500 and M =
1000. The letter "u" is rendered as V and the letter "w," which doesn't
exist in the Latin alphabet, would be rendered as VV. So this title
would read in Latin as VICARIVS FILII DEI.</p>
          <p align="left">When calculating the value of a name or word,
letters that don't have a numerical value are ignored. For example,
drop out the no-value letters in my name, PATRICK MADRID, and you come
up with 2102 &#8212; 1 (i) + 100 (c) + 1000 (m) + 500 (d) + 1 (i) + 500 (d) =
2102. By the way, this is one reason why, as far as I know, no one has
yet accused me of being in league with the anti-Christ. The numbers
just don't add up.</p>
          <p align="left">But in the case of VICARIVS FILII DEI, they
do add up to 666. Isolate the numbers and this is what you get: 5 (v) +
1 (i) + 100 (c) + 1 (i) + 5 (V) + 1 (i) + 50 (L) + 1 (i) + 1 (i) + 500
(d) + 1 (i) = 666.</p>
          <p align="left">But there are problems with this. The first
is that <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Vicarius
Filii Dei, or "Vicar of the Son of God," is not now, nor has it ever
been, a title of the bishop of Rome.</span> The second problem is that
virtually no one, including many unsuspecting lay Catholics, knows that
          <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">this papal
"title" is a fabrication</span>. To an untrained ear, it sounds enough
like one of the pope's real titles, Vicarius Christi (Vicar of Christ),
to pass the test. Unfortunately for those who traffic in this
particular piece of pope fiction, the real title, Vicarius Christi,
adds up to only a measly 214, not the infernal 666. In fact, none of
the pope's official titles, such as Servus Servorum Dei (Servant of the
Servants of God), Pontifex Maximus (Supreme Pontiff), or Successor
Petri (Successor of Peter), will add up to 666. That's why you never
see any of them used by anti-Catholics.</p>
          <p align="left"><span
 style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">If the person making this
claim disputes these facts, ask him to furnish even one example of a
papal decree, ecclesiastical letter, conciliar statement, or any other
official Catholic document in which the pope calls himself or is
referred to as the "Vicar of the Son of God." He won't be able to find
one, because none exist. Vicarius Filii Dei has never been a title of
the pope.</span></p>

          <p align="left">Poof! That part was easy, but some people,
especially <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">Seventh-Day
Adventists, will ignore the evidence (or lack of it)</span> and hold
tenaciously to the notion that "Vicar of the Son of God" is an official
papal title and therefore identifies the pope as the Beast of
Revelation. What else can be said in response?</p>
          <p align="left">Using the same math exercise we did above,
point out that the name of the woman who started the Seventh-Day
Adventist church, Ellen Gould White, also adds up to 666 in Latin. (L +
L + V +D + V + V + I = 666). Then ask if this proves that she is the
Beast. I can assure you the answer won't be "yes." If the answer is
"no," ask how this numbers game could possibly prove the pope or anyone
else is the Beast. If you're answered with silence, it's a good bet
that you've made some progress with the person.</p>
          <p align="left"><span
 style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">The main fact to impress
on someone who uses this argument is that a papal title had to be
invented, one that could produce the magic number, in order to give
this argument legs.</span></p>
          <p align="left">But we're not quite finished cutting it off
at the knees. The charge that the pope is the Beast because he wears a
crown, and Revelation 13:1 says the Beast wears crowns and has
"blasphemous names" written on his head, must also be answered. This we
can do more quickly.</p>
          <p align="left">Since about the year 708, many popes have
worn at non-liturgical ceremonial events a special papal crown called a
tiara, but the stylized beehive-shaped papal crown of three diadems
that we have come to know as a tiara emerged only in the early 14th
century. Although it was customary for tiaras to be encrusted with
jewels and precious ornaments, there is no evidence &#8212; no statue, bust,
painting, drawing or even written description of any of the many tiaras
that were crafted &#8212; that any papal tiara ever had the name or title of
a pope emblazoned on it.</p>

          <p align="left">This is significant, because there have been
medieval and Renaissance popes whose extravagant vanity prodded them to
have lavishly ornamented, jewel-encrusted tiaras made for themselves.
And we possess paintings and statues and other representations of them
produced during their lifetimes that show these tiaras (we even possess
some of the actual tiaras). If any popes in history would have been
tempted to succumb to the bad taste of spelling out "Vicarius Filii
Dei" in diamonds across the front of their tiaras, these men would have
&#8212; but they didn't. No pope did. One particular anti-Catholic tract I've
seen shows a plain metal tiara with Vicarius Filii Dei written in
diamonds across it. But it was a drawing &#8212; not a photograph of a museum
piece or even a photo of a painting of a tiara.</p>
          <p align="left">It had to be drawn, of course, because the
"666 papal crown"&#8212; as with all the other pope fictions&#8212;has only ever
existed in the minds of those who perpetuate this fantasy.</p>

          <p align="left">I accept your challenge.&nbsp; I would like
to offer my article at <a
 href="http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/666.htm">
http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/666.htm</a> in response. I personally
have Lucius Ferraris' Prompta Bibliotheca, 1858 Paris edition, a
Catholic theological encyclopedia, in which the title VICARIUS FILII
DEI appears in volume 5, column 1828, under "PAPA" (Pope), "Article
II." I have scanned the item and it appears in my article. Prompta
Bibliotheca, according to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, is "a
veritable encyclopedia of religious knowledge" and "will ever remain a
precious mine of information" and is quoted frequently as an
authoritative Catholic source.</p>
          <p align="left">Vicarius Filii Dei also appeared repeatedly
in Catholic canon law for hundreds of years (Anselm's, Cardinal
Deusdedit's, and Gratian's Decretum also known as Concordia
Discordantium Canonum), in quotes of the Donation of Constantine which
contained the title and was considered authentic by the Church for many
hundreds of years, having been cited by as many as 10 Popes as proof of
their temporal authority. One 1879 edition of Corpus Juris Canonici
containing VICARIUS FILII DEI is presented in my article.</p>
          <p align="left">In "Crossing The Threshold of Hope", by Pope
John Paul II: First Chapter: "The Pope": A Scandal and a Mystery, page
3, you will find:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">"The Pope is considered the man on earth
who represents the Son of God, who "takes the place" of the Second
Person of the omnipotent God of the Trinity".</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left">If you directly translate "represents the Son
of God" into Latin, the official language of the Church, you get
"Vicarius Filii Dei".</p>
          <p align="left">In my article I present the above and other
evidence to show conclusively that VICARIUS FILII DEI is not a fraud,
and that it was indeed used by the Catholic Church for well over 600
years. In fairness, I have included a link to your article from mine so
that my readers can see a Catholic viewpoint on the matter. If you are
so sure that VICARIUS FILII DEI is a fabrication, then I challenge you,
in reciprocal fairness, to include a link to my article from yours to
show the historical evidence to your readership.</p>

initial web index page and will be happy to append any response of

          <p align="left">I am indeed SDA, and wish to dispel the
notion that Adventists ignore "the evidence" as you claim. You may
still claim that it is not today, or ever was an officially recognized
papal title, but since the association with 666 apparently first
surfaced in 1612, it is no real surprise that Catholics are ignorant of
the facts on this matter today, or that the title is denied by Catholic
apologists.</p>
          <p align="left">The lack of official recognition today,
however, does not in any way prove that Vicarius Filii Dei is a fantasy
or fabrication concocted by Protestantism. The documented evidence I
present shows beyond any doubt that Vicarius Filii Dei is not, as your
article suggests, merely a groundless anti-Catholic invention. On the
contrary, it has a very long history of use by the Catholic Church,
having appeared in print in Catholic Canon Law, a respected Catholic
encyclopedia, and Catholic newspapers. Those are the hard facts, which
the Adventists at least, choose not to ignore.</p>
          <p align="left">I look forward to your published response in

"In regard to Mr. Madrid's zealous efforts to eradicate 'papal
fictions' from the cobwebs of our minds, I was not impressed. To begin
with, the attempt to locate an ecclesiastical colossus headed by the
papacy at Rome as demonstrated in the New Testament, is an exercise in
futility. We Protestants never cease to be amazed at your tireless
armchair theological gymnastics to persuade us in the opposite, though
not unreasonable direction. If the Lord Jesus Christ had intended to
establish the supreme authority of Peter perpetuated in a dynastic line
of popes who would enjoy absolute episcopal jurisdiction over the
entire world, all logic demands that He would have categorically and
intentionally informed his followers in no uncertain terms! But He did
not. Other sacred offices of the church are set forth in Holy Writ, yet
strange silence prevails with regard to that which is supposedly the
highest of them all! The silence of the inspired writers in omitting to
mention such a high office is equivalent to Napoleon's biographer
failing to use the title of emperor.</p>
                <p align="left">"Now Mr. Madrid takes great glee in
swinging the wrecking ball at those who would entertain the thought
that the pope fits the description of the beast in Revelation 13. May I
say that the allusions to Catholicism in the book of Revelation are
quite intriguing, and many have concluded what Mr. Madrid rejects, but
certainly not without reason. Besides, we are told that wisdom is
needed here: 'Let him that has understanding count the number. . . for
it is the number of a man; and his number is 666.' I noticed no attempt
whatsoever on the part of the author to display any understanding in
offering an alternative explanation. Hence it is obvious he is only
interested in bashing a popular Protestant position and is content to
congratulate himself for doing so. Mr. Madrid triumphantly concludes
that the title <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> is not now, nor has it ever
been, a title of the bishops of Rome, and insinuates that Protestants
are merely dumb bunnies pulling this 'rabbit' out of a hat.
Unfortunately, the author is not being entirely forthright with his
readers. He says, 'If the person making this claim dispute these facts,
let him produce. . . any official Catholic document in which the pope
calls himself or is referred to as, "Vicar of the Son of God" . . .
none exist.' Drum roll please.</p>
                <p align="left">"In the early collection of canon law,
the <em> Decretum of Gratian</em>, first published in 1148, we read,
(Latin) '<em>Beatus Petrus in terris vicarious Filii Dei videtur esse
consitutus.</em>' Translated into English, it means, "Blessed Peter is
seen to have been constituted vicar of the Son of God on earth."
Furthermore, in the revised <em>Corpus of Canon</em> (sic), published
by order of Pope Gregory XIII, it was to be corrected by, 'the
plenitude of apostolic power,' so that it is, 'entirely freed from
faults.' Therein we find the same statement as above. And I go on, when
Lucius Ferraris wrote, <em>Prompta Bibliotheca</em> in 1755, he gave
under the article 'Papa,' the title, <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>, and
cited the revised canon law as his authority. When his work was revised
and published in Rome in 1890, the document and aforementioned title
were retained! Moreover, the <em> Catholic Encyclopedia</em> says his
work, 'will ever remain a precious mine of information' (1913, vol. 6,
p.48).</p>
                <p align="left">"In conclusion, a subscriber to <em>Our
Sunday Visitor</em>, a Catholic weekly periodical, wrote a letter to
the editor, wherein he asked, 'What are the letters supposed to be in
the pope's crown, and what do they signify, if anything?' The answer
given was, 'The letters inscribed on the pope's mitre are these: <em>
Vicarius Filii Dei</em>, which is Latin for, Vicar of the Son of God'
(April 18, 1915, Vol. 3, Number 51, p. 3)."</p>

you issue a challenge for the critics of Catholicism to furnish one
example of an official Catholic document in which the pope is referred
to as <em>Vicarius Filii Dei.</em> I accept your challenge.</p>
                <p align="left">"I personally have Lucius Ferraris' <em>Prompta
Bibliotheca</em>, 1858 Paris edition, a Catholic theological
encyclopedia, in which the title <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> appears
in volume 5, column 1828, under 'Papa,' article 2. I have scanned the
item and it appears in an article on my <em>Bible Light</em> web site.
                <em>Prompta Bibliotheca</em>, according to the 1913 <em>Catholic
Encyclopedia</em>, is 'a veritable encyclopedia of religious
knowledge,' and 'will ever remain a precious mine of information' and
is quoted frequently as an authoritative Catholic source.</p>
                <p align="left">"<em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> also
appeared repeatedly in Catholic canon law for hundreds of years
(Anselm's, Cardinal Deusdedit's, and Gratian's <em>Decretum</em>, also
known as <em>Concordia Discordantium Canonum</em>), in quotes of the <em>
Donation of Constantine</em>, which contained the title and was
considered authentic by the Church for many hundreds of years, having
been cited by as many as 10 popes as proof of their temporal authority.
One 1879 edition of <em>Corpus Juris Canonici</em> containing <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> is presented in my article.</p>
                <p align="left">"In <em>Crossing the Threshold of Hope</em>,
by Pope John Paul II, in the first chapter, page 3, you will find that,
'The pope is considered the man on earth who represents the Son of God,
who "takes the place" of the Second Person of the omnipotent God of the
Trinity.' If you directly translate 'represents the Son of God' into
Latin, the official language of the Church, you get <em>Vicarius Filii
Dei</em>.</p>
                <p align="left">"I am a Seventh Day Adventist, and wish
to dispel the notion that Adventists ignore 'the evidence' as you
claim. You may still claim that it is not today, or ever was an
officially recognized papal title, but since the association with 666
apparently first surfaced in 1612, it is no real surprise that
Catholics are ignorant of the facts on this matter today, or that the
title is denied by Catholic apologists.</p>
                <p align="left">"The lack of official recognition
today, however, does not in any way prove that <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>
is a fantasy or fabrication concocted by Protestantism. The documented
evidence I present shows beyond any doubt that <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>
is not, as your article suggests, merely a groundless anti-Catholic
invention. On the contrary, it has a very long history of use by the
Catholic Church, having appeared in print in the Catholic Canon Law, a
respected Catholic encyclopedia and Catholic newspapers. Those are the
hard facts, which the Adventists, at least, choose not to ignore."</p>

        <blockquote>
          <center>
          <p align="left">Hard facts? Mmmm, . . . no. I don't think so.
But I will say this much for Mr. Scheifler: He obviously thought about
this matter long and hard before coming up with the wrong answer. In
reality, the "hard facts" indicate that Mr. Scheifler also seems to
have plagiarized from the same book out of which Mr. Drisko took his
arguments. Perhaps Seventh Day Adventists have only a single
anti-Catholic source book to filch from. In any case, at least Mr.
Scheifler, unlike Mr. Drisko, had the good taste not to copy Uriah
Smith word for word. Even so, the remarkable similarity between his
"essay" and the corresponding section in Mr. Uriah Smith's book is
unmistakable &#8212; the kind of similarity that would get him into hot
water, perhaps even expelled, if he tried something like this in a
university setting.</p>
          <p align="left">But enough. With that unpleasantness aside,
I'll now respond to the arguments raised in these letters, most of
which (thanks to Mr. Drisko and Mr. Scheifler's, ahem. . . borrowing
from a common source) are shared by all three writers.<a name="bashing"></a></p>
          <p align="left">1. First, Mr. Drisko remarks about me that,
"[I]t is obvious he is only interested in bashing a popular Protestant
position and is content to congratulate himself for doing so." How
ironic! <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">If anyone is
"bashing," isn't it the Seventh-Day Adventists? After all, they are the
ones who conjured up the bogus <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> canard in
the first place to attack the Catholic Church.</span><a href="#*">*</a>
My article responded to this charge. Mr. Drisko's equating this with
"bashing" is astonishing.</p>
          <p align="left">2. Mr. Drisko claims that if Jesus meant to
found the papacy, "all logic demands that He would have categorically
and intentionally informed his followers in no uncertain terms!" Very
well. Let's apply this same principle to the Trinity. If Jesus meant
for Christians to believe in the Trinity (the most fundamental tenet of
the Christian Faith), logic demands that he would have categorically
and intentionally informed his followers <em>in no uncertain terms</em>.
Perhaps Mr. Drisko could show us in Scripture where, "in no uncertain
terms," Jesus Christ teaches that God exists in three coequal,
co-eternal, consubstantial persons. Obviously, He nowhere does this.
The Trinity doctrine is certainly scriptural, but any systematic
biblical defense of it must be assembled from many verses. So, if even
as bedrock a doctrine as the Trinity is neither mentioned by name nor
categorically explained "in no uncertain terms" in Scripture, it's
inconsistent and incorrect to demand the same of the papacy.</p>
          <p align="left">Mr. Drisko also argues that "the attempt to
locate an ecclesiastical colossus headed by the papacy at Rome as
demonstrated in the New Testament, is an exercise in futility." Here I
agree with him, but not for the reason he might think.</p>
          <p align="left">He's right. We shouldn't (and don't) expect
to find the full-blown, developed papacy, colossal or otherwise, in the
New Testament. Why not? Because the New Testament shows us a picture of
the primitive Church, the Church as it was in its infancy, the Church
in "mustard seed" form. And Christ Himself promised that His Church,
"The Kingdom of God," is an organic entity, one that would grow and
develop until it became tree-like.</p>
          <p align="left">The mustard seed bears no resemblance
whatsoever to its mature form. Surely Mr. Drisko must recognize this
and its parallel with the Church (and the papacy). So while it would
indeed be futile to attempt to find a fully developed papacy in the
pages of the New Testament, it is equally futile for Mr. Drisko to
claim that this somehow undermines the Catholic position on the papacy.
It doesn't.</p>
          <p align="left">3. Both Mr. Drisko and Mr. Scheifler cite the
          <em> Decretum of Gratian</em> and the <em>Corpus of Canon Law</em>
as evidence that <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> is contained in
"official" Catholic documents. What Mr. Drisko doesn't seem to realize
is that those sections of the Decretum and the Corpus he cites are
actually from the Donation of Constantine, a famous forgery (anyone
familiar with medieval Church history could have told him that).
Obviously, a forged document is not an "official Catholic document,"
even though it may have been regarded by many as authentic.</p>
          <p align="left">Mr. Drisko and Mr. Scheifler should have read
"<em>Pope Fiction</em>" more carefully, for they seem to have entirely
missed the point here. My claim centered on the twin facts that <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> is not an official papal title and that it is never used
as such in <em>official</em> Church documents &#8212; not forged documents,
not civil documents, not unofficial documents. Since these two are so
fond of quoting the Catholic Encyclopedia when it suits them, I should
point out that they didn't bother to quote from the "Pope: Primacy of
Honour: Titles and Insignia" article in the same 1913 Encyclopedia.
Actually, they wouldn't have been able to quote from it because, under
the section of "official titles of the pope," the phrase "<em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em>" is nowhere to be found. But we shouldn't be surprised
that this escapes the notice of these two men. It seems they relied
heavily (and in Mr. Drisko's case, entirely) on the flawed "evidence"
contained in Mr. Smith's book, without bothering to check the accuracy
of his charges.</p>
          <p align="left">The fact that the <em>Donation of Constantine</em>
was wrongly assumed to be legitimate is irrelevant. What makes the <em>
Donation</em> even more irrelevant to this issue is that even if it
were not a forgery, it still wouldn't qualify as an official <em>
Catholic</em> document. At best, it would have been an official <em>
state</em> document, emanating from the Roman imperial government.
That's because whoever forged it purported to be the Emperor
Constantine, decreeing a series of land grants and various other
temporal advantages to the bishop of Rome. So, unfortunately for Mr.
Drisko and Mr. Scheifler's argument, the forged <em>Donation of
Constantine</em> cannot qualify, on two counts: A) it's bogus and B)
even if it weren't, it would only be a civil document.</p>
          <p align="left">4. Next, both Mr. Drisko and Mr. Scheifler
cite Lucius Ferraris' <em>Prompta Bibliotheca</em> as further evidence
that <em> Vicarius Filii Dei</em> is an official title of the pope.
But here again, both men seem to be lost in a maze of historical
details they don't understand.</p>
          <p align="left">The section of <em>Prompta Bibliotheca</em>
Mr. Scheifler refers to is also a quote from the <em>Donation of
Constantine</em> forgery. Naturally, Fr. Ferraris, a Franciscan
ecclesiastical historian, could have been considerably more careful in
his use of sources, given the fact that for fully 300 years before he
compiled the <em>Prompta Bibliotheca</em>, it was widely known that
the <em>Donation of Constantine</em> was a forgery. But again, his
injudicious inclusion of the forgery hardly constitutes evidence of <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> being used as an official title of the pope. In fact,
regarding Ferraris' scholarship, the Catholic Encyclopedia passage
Scheifler and Drisko quote incompletely reads in full, "This supplement
serves to keep up to date the work of Ferraris, which will ever remain
a precious mine of information, <em>although it is sometimes possible
to reproach the author with laxism</em>." His use of the <em>Donation
of Constantine</em> is certainly one such instance. Not surprisingly,
Mr. Scheifler and Mr. Drisko both failed to include the italicized
portion of this <em>Encyclopedia</em> quote. Why? Because it undercuts
their argument, and they apparently don't wish the unsuspecting reader
to know that.</p>
          <p align="left">5. Mr. Drisko offers a quote from a 1915
edition of <em>Our Sunday Visitor</em> newspaper, to the effect that
the papal mitre is inscribed with diamonds with the title <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em>. I contacted Robert Lockwood, the president of <em>Our
Sunday Visitor</em>, about this. He had personally gone through the OSV
archives and reported that he had found no evidence that that this
quote ever appeared in any issue of the paper. Evidently, it had been
removed from the archive. The error on the part of a newspaper staffer
(and let's remember, the Catholic Church does not claim infallibility
for journalists) was caught only after it had slipped into print, but
the editor was obviously concerned about the incorrect answer being
perpetuated, so he expunged that issue from the archives.</p>
          <p align="left">Not surprisingly, those who perpetuate the <em>
Vicarius Filii Dei</em> myth never mention the several strong
disavowals of this issue made by <em>Our Sunday Visitor</em> newspaper
over the years. For example, in the <a href="OSV-1941.gif"><b> August
3, 1941</b></a> issue, a reader posed this question: "A pamphlet has
come to me entitled Mark of the Beast. It identifies the pope with the
mark (ie. 666) referred to in Revelation 13:16-18."</p>
          <p align="left">The editor responded: "The question you ask
has been answered many times, although not in recent years, in this
paper. If we have recourse to the best biblical scholars or exegetes,
we find them applying the text from Revelations to Nero, the
archpersecutor of Christianity in the first century. To give color to
their accusation, enemies of the Church publicize something that is not
at all true, and that is that the pope's tiara is inscribed with the
words 'VICARIUS FILII DEI,' and that if the letters in that title were
translated into Roman numerals, the sum would equal 666. As a matter of
fact, the tiara of the pope bears no inscription whatsoever."</p>
          <p align="left">Robert Lockwood has written a letter on
behalf of <em> Our Sunday Visitor</em> explaining that the 1915 remark
regarding the alleged inscription on the pope's mitre was an
unintentional and unfortunate error that should not be used as
"evidence" to support the Vicarius Filii Dei argument. A copy of this
letter is being sent to the Seventh-Day Adventist headquarters,
demanding that they stop using this episode as some sort of "proof" to
prop up their argument. Let's hope that honesty and a desire to know
the truth will compel Seventh-Day Adventists to stop using the
illegitimate OSV quote.</p>
          <p align="left">So, if the very best our Adventist friends
can do is point to an alleged passage from a Catholic newspaper printed
nearly a century ago, this demonstrates further the fact that <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> is not an official title of the pope. If it were, why
would Adventists have to go through such gyrations to find an example
of it? If it were an official papal title, examples would be strewn
everywhere (as are occurrences of <em>Vicarius Christi, Servus
Servorum Dei</em>, etc.). In spite of his strenuous efforts at
historical sleuthing, the "evidence" Mr. Drisko present is hardly the
smoking gun he imagines it to be.</p>
          <p align="left">6. Finally, Mr. Scheifler claims that the
phrase "represents the Son of God," quoted from Pope John Paul II's <em>
Crossing the Threshold of Hope</em>, if translated directly into Latin,
comes out to <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>.</p>
          <p align="left">Alas, if only Mr. Scheifler's Latin were as
good as his imagination. In fact, the phrase "Represents the Son of
God," translated directly into Latin, yields "<em>Filium Dei
Repraesentat</em>, not <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>. Oh well. It should
suffice to point out that "represents" is a verb. "Vicar" is a noun.
But let's not belabor the obvious.</p>
          <p align="left">To sum up, the errors in both Mr. Scheifler's
and Mr. Drisko's letters are based on three fundamentally flawed
premises. The first is that the Latin form of Vicar of the Son of God
is a title (not an actual title, of course, but a made-up one), and the
Book of Revelation identifies the number of the Beast as a <em>name</em>,
not a title (Rev. 13:17-18). So all this talk about titles is
irrelevant anyway.</p>
          <p align="left">Second, they erroneously assume that simply
because the pope has been called <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>, or
described in a roundabout way as such, that it must necessarily be an <em>official
title</em> of the pope. Think about that. Office workers often refer to
their supervisor as "the boss." While that's an accurate description of
him, it's nevertheless not his official title. You might also refer to
him as "the Big Cheese," or "the Big Kahuna." While these may be apt
descriptions of the individual, they're nevertheless <em>not</em>
official titles. Similarly, the pope can indeed be described as the
Vicar of the Son of God, for that is exactly what he is, yet this is
not an official title.</p>
          <p align="left">In my article I stated that <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> has never been an official title of the pope. I didn't
claim that no one in the 2,000-year history of the Church has ever
described him in such a way.</p>
          <p align="left"><a name="accurate"></a>I am at fault, though,
for not having been more precise when I wrote, "If the person making
this claim disputes these facts, let him produce. . . any official
Catholic document in which the pope calls himself or is referred to as,
'Vicar of the Son of God.'" I assumed the reader would understand that
the mere fact that if a pope had been <em>described</em> as the vicar
of the Son of God, which, as I mentioned, is a theologically accurate
description, that would not be the same as an example of an official
title. If I had left out the phrase "referred to as," I could have
saved Mr. Drisko and Mr. Scheifler all their trouble. <em>Mea culpa</em>.
(By the way, that adds up to 1150.)</p>
          <p align="left">But back to the matter at hand. The third
fatal flaw in the Seventh-Day Adventist argument is its arbitrary
selection of the Latin "title" <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>. Why not
use a real title of the pope? I listed several in my original article
(eg. Servus Servorum Dei, Pontifex Maximus and Successor Petri). The
reason our Adventist friends neglect to mention, much less deal with,
these actual papal titles is because they refute their claim. None adds
up to 666, the number they so badly want to pin on the pope.</p>
          <p align="left">And another question: Why do Seventh-Day
Adventists and other papal critics insist on using a Latin phrase (ie.
Vicarius Filii Dei) to arrive at 666, when Revelation was written, not
in Latin, but in Greek? The numeric identification of the Beast as
"666" in Revelation is tied to the values of Greek letters, not Latin
ones. Adventists like Mr. Scheifler ignore this basic fact for an
obvious reason: The Greek form of <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> doesn't
add up to 666.</p>
          <p align="left">Notice too that Mr. Drisko and Mr. Scheifler
ignored the fact that the name of Ellen Gould White, the founder of
their religion (Seventh-Day Adventism), adds up to 666 in Latin. The
same is true of Martin Luther and of other figures they hold dear.
Allow me to demonstrate how this technique works:</p>
          <p align="left">First we begin with a title. Since he started
the ball rolling, let's assign one to Allan Drisko. How about, Drisko
Vicar of Scheifler? Translate that into Latin, and we have <em>Drisko
Vicarius Scheifleri</em> which produces a hefty 760. Not quite 666. So
let's make up another title for him: Plagiarist of the Error of
Scheifler. But in the true spirit of Seventh Day Adventist scholarship,
let's get a little bit more creative:</p>
          <p align="left">I ran the numbers on MICHAEL SCHEIFLER. In
Latin that comes to 1302 &#8212; way too much to get him into any biblical
trouble. But then I noticed that 666 x 2 = 1332, a mere 30 away from
double trouble! So then I made up a Latin title for Mr. Scheifler, to
reflect his use of Mr. Smith's work: <em>Scheifler Vicarius Smithi</em>.
That yields 1265, and since Mr. Scheifler can only claim half the
credit for his work, we reduce that figure by half and get 632. So
close, yet so far. Unfortunately, this tack seemed to lead nowhere,
lucky for Mr. Schiefler. So I turned again to Mr. Drisko.</p>
          <p align="left">First, I converted ALLAN DRISKO into Greek
and Hebrew (the two languages of the Bible). His name in Greek adds up
to 1246, while the Hebrew gives us 634. When we put the two together
(just as the Hebrew Old Testament was joined with the Greek New
Testament) we get 1880. We divide this by three (the three persons of
the Trinity being at the center of the Old and New Testaments) and get
626.6666666667.</p>
          <p align="left">The first number is an obvious hint as to our
next action. 626 can also be understood as saying "6 to 6." So, keeping
the Scriptures at the center of all our calculations (to keep Mr.
Drisko happy), we count the number of books between the 6th book of the
Protestant Old Testament (Joshua) to the 6th book of the New Testament
(Romans). The number we get is 40, which is then added to our previous
number. The result is a frightening 666.6666666667. Since 7 is the
Biblical number indicating perfection or completion, we know we're
finished with our calculations. So, it seems that Mr. Alan Drisko bears
the number of the Beast not once, not twice, but four times over!</p>
          <p align="left">Needless to say, I'll be sending my findings
to the Vatican.</p>

          <p align="left">Mr. Madrid,</p>
          <p align="left">It is exceedingly interesting that <strong> <a
 href="http://www.osv.com/"><em>Our Sunday Visitor</em></a></strong>
has no copy of the April 18th, 1915 edition of their own publication.
Now either the quote from that issue is merely another false
anti-Catholic fabrication, or it is genuine, and someone, perhaps a
former editor as you suggest, is guilty of destroying the embarrassing
evidence. As it so happens, I have a facsimile copy of that very
article obtained from an Adventist University. I have scanned it and
just posted the image in my article on 666 at <a
 href="http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/666.htm">
http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/666.htm</a> - it might even be possible
to provide a facsimile copy of the <em>entire</em> missing edition to
Mr. Lockwood and <em>Our Sunday Visitor</em>, so that their archive
can be more complete. But interestingly enough, that was <em>not the
only issue</em> of <em>OSV</em> that acknowledged the veracity of <em>
Vicarius Filii Dei</em> as a papal title, the Nov 15, 1914 edition did
as well. A scanned copy of this is also available in the above article.</p>
          <p align="left">It really does not matter how many subsequent
retractions or denials <em>Our Sunday Visitor</em> may have published
over the years and Mr. Lockwood's letter of protest to Adventist
Headquarters will have no effect at all, because he cannot himself<em>
prove</em> that article to be in error. That barn door is already open,
and no mere verbal denial will close it. There is, and was, really only
one way for the Catholic Church to really prove this issue one way or
another, and that remains to produce <em>all</em> the papal tiaras in
its vaults and allow close up inspection of every single one of them.
But, dare I suggest first, that even if such a tiara <em>ever</em>
existed, (and I believe it did) as claimed in <em>OSV</em>, it has
surely met with precisely the same fate as you propose for the archival
copy of the April 18th, 1915 edition of <em>Our Sunday Visitor</em>?
Lets face it, the Roman Catholic Church would obviously <em>never</em>
let it see the light of day, or admit that it ever existed.</p>
          <p align="left">You know, it is totally irrelevant to this
discussion who you think you can make the number 666 fit, Ellen White
or otherwise. The issue I have raised with you is whether or not <em>
Vicarius Filii Dei</em> is purely a fabrication as you maintained. I
take special note of these admissions on your part:</p>

          <p align="left">From this, you now apparently will concede
that the phrase <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>, in point of fact, has
been used by Catholics themselves to refer to the Pope. That in my
opinion, <em>is the very nub of this discussion</em>.</p>
          <p align="left">The phrase was <em>discovered</em> in
Catholic Canon Law, in quotes of the <em>Donation of Constantine</em>,
which the&nbsp;Catholic Church trumpeted loudly for hundreds of years
as absolutely genuine. Knowing this, how can you&nbsp; seriously
continue to assert that anti-Catholics have "conjured up the bogus
Vicarius Filii Dei canard"? I maintain that every single time a Pope
quoted the <em>Donation of Constantine</em> as proof of his temporal
authority, or the <em>Donation</em> was quoted as genuine in Canon
Law, this effectively constituted an acknowledgment that the phrase <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> was also considered to be authentic, <em>and this
situation existed for well over 600 years.</em></p>
          <p align="left">Were the <em>Donation</em> not such a
stupendously famous fraud, it too might have gone the way of the pope's
alleged inscribed tiara and the April 18th, 1915 edition of <em>Our
Sunday Visitor</em>, and simply disappeared from Catholic archives
after the discovery that <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> added up to 666.
But circumstances prevented subterfuge in this instance, and the Roman
Catholic Church is now stuck with the embarrassing legacy of temporal
papal authority being asserted for hundreds of years on the basis of a
fraudulent document, probably of the Church's own making. How ironic
that in the process of trying to assert papal authority, they are <em>
also</em> permanently branded by their own hand with <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> and 666. What poetic justice!</p>
          <p align="left">You ask:</p>

the title of the popes should be reckoned according to the Greek
gematria, since John wrote in Greek, but since the title appears in
Latin, and Latin is the official language of the Church of Rome and the
language of its adopted Bible, the Vulgate, such a procedure would
destroy the numerical value of that title in its own language. It would
seem reasonable that a Latin title should exhibit its Latin numerical
values rather than Greek values."</p>

any manipulation</em>.</p>
          <p align="left">As to your assertion that <em>Represents the
Son of God</em> translates to <em>Filium Dei Repraesentat</em>, but
not <em>Vicarius Filii Dei, </em>Pope John Paul II in his <strong> <a

Crossing The Threshold of Hope</em></a></strong> says (emphasis is
mine):</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">[pg. 3] The leader of the Catholic Church
is defined by the faith as the <strong>Vicar of Jesus Christ</strong>
(and is accepted as such by believers). The Pope is considered the man
on earth who <strong>represents the Son of God</strong>, who "takes
the place" of the Second Person of the omnipotent God of the Trinity.</p>
            <p align="left">[pg. 13] The Pope is not the only one who
holds this title. With regard to the Church entrusted to him, each
bishop is <strong>Vicarius Christi.</strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="left">It is not difficult for everyone to see that
the Pope himself equates the word Vicarius/Vicar to "represents" in the
title <em> Vicar of Jesus Christ</em> / <em>Vicarius Christi</em>.
This is something so obvious, that even without the papal support cited
above, I am frankly astounded that you think you can legitimately claim
          <em> Vicarius Filii Dei</em> does <em>not</em> also mean
"represents the Son of God".</p>

Catholic documents, something he originally denied. <i>This admission
completely and totally validates the application of Vicarius Filii Dei,
and hence the number 666, to the papacy!</i></p>
          <p>But then, Patrick revises and narrows his rules to only
consider usage of <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> by a Pope as valid, and
then only in an "authentic" document. (Where is it written that Patrick
sets the ground rules for this?) This revision is crafted to
specifically exclude the whole of Catholic Canon Law, and all similar
references to <i> Vicarius Filii Dei</i> (i.e. Prompta Bibliotheca)
that are quotes of the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>, because the <i>Donation</i>
is now known to be fraudulent (not "authentic") and is therefore
unacceptable by his new carefully narrowed rules:</p>
          <div align="center">
          <table style="border-collapse: collapse;" bgcolor="#ffe6e6"

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>... Anyone familiar with medieval Church history
will recognize the <i>Donation</i> as one of the better known examples

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          </div>
          <p>The elephant in the room he so conveniently overlooks, is
the fact that the <i>Donation of Constantine</i> was considered to be
an <i> absolutely genuine document</i> by the Roman Catholic Church
for well over 600 years, which is why it was repeatedly quoted in
Catholic Canon Law in the first place, in order to bolster papal
authority. Despite an apparent unwillingness of Patrick Madrid to face
this fact squarely, the discerning reader of <i>Pope Fiction</i> will
still see that <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> is <i>not</i> a
"fabrication" as he claims. History testifies clearly that it appeared
in print in Catholic documents repeatedly for many centuries, even
being applied by Catholics themselves to the papacy, and so "cannot by
any stretch of semantics be regarded as" an Adventist "fabrication". <i>Vicarius
Filii Dei</i> is simply <i>not</i> an anti-Catholic invention or
fantasy, rather it is an established historical FACT. Consequently, the
application of <i> Vicarius Filii Dei</i> and 666 to the papacy stands
vindicated, and unimpeached by Patrick Madrid's <i>Pope Fiction</i>.</p>

which is attributed to one's opponent in a debate, and is easily
refuted. The intent of a strawman argument is to deceptively
demonstrate that the opponent's position is quite preposterous, and has
no basis in truth. It does not actually address the opponent's true
position on an argument, but <i>misrepresents</i> it, in order to make
it appear easy to demolish. Note the following examples of this tactic
used by Patrick Madrid in his <i>Pope Fiction</i> TV program on
Vicarius Filii Dei:</p>
  <div align="center">

        <td>... and they claim also that the Pope's tiara or that, that
a, crown, the metal crown that Popes have worn for about the last
thousand years, has written across the front of it in jewels, 666, or
in some other variations of this Pope fiction, that it is written out
Vicarius Filii Dei, which adds up to 666.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p align="left">Patrick wants you to believe that anti-Catholics
claim that Popes wore a tiara with the <i>actual number 666 on it in
jewels. </i>Can anything be more absurd than this? What Pope would <i>ever</i>
do this? None surely. I have to ask, can Patrick Madrid furnish any
evidence that Seventh-day Adventists, or any Protestants, have <i>ever</i>
made this claim? I dare say he cannot. The intent of the
misrepresentation, or strawman, is to make the Vicarius Filii Dei claim
look equally preposterous, however, it is quite plausible that a Pope
might very well wear a tiara with that phrase, not knowing that it
added up to 666. That <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> in the early 20th
century could claim Vicarius Filii Dei was indeed on the papal tiara,
demonstrates this possibility.</p>

Unfortunately we have to disappoint him and those who bind to this line
of reasoning. For one thing, those examples of Vicarius Filii Dei that
are are often cited from the <i>Decretum</i> and the <i>Corpus of
Canon Law </i>are actually drawn from the so-called <i>Donation of
Constantine,</i> which was a famous forgery. And if those who are
familiar with medieval history happen to glance into this they will
immediately recognize the Donation as a forgery of an ecclesiastical
document. So, that document, as such, cannot be by any stretch of the

  <p align="left"><font size="3">Patrick now knowingly reveals, for the
education of his audience, the fact that Vicarius Filii Dei, appearing
in Catholic Canon Law, actually originated in the <i>Donation of
Constantine</i>, a forgery, to the apparent utter disappointment and
frustration of the sadly ignorant Seventh-day Adventists. This is
another subtle misrepresentation of the facts by Patrick. I quote from </font>
  <i>Daniel and Revelation</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, the validity of this
title has been questioned, but historical evidence remains that this
arrogated title has served to support the authority of the popes in
building up their vast temporal supremacy during the heyday of Romanism
in medieval times, and in maintaining their spiritual authority to this
day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The particular title <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em> appeared
as early as 752-774 in a document historically known as the "Donation
of Constantine." Though this document was later proved to have been
written by someone else and signed with the name of Constantine the
Great to give it the weight of his authority&#8212;a practice not uncommon in
medieval times&#8212;yet this so-called Donation of Constantine was used as
valid by at least nine of the popes over a period of seven centuries or
more in establishing the spiritual and temporal supremacy of the
bishops of Rome. ... The document employing the title was confirmed by
a church council, says Binius, a high Roman Catholic dignitary of
Cologne, quoted by Labbe and Cossart. [49] It was incorporated in Roman
Catholic canon law by Gratian, and when this last-named work was
revised and published, with endorsement by Pope Gregory XIII, the title
was retained.&#8212; <i>Daniel and Revelation</i>, 1944 revised edition,
pages 621-622 (See also below).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Adventists were quite well aware that the <i>Donation</i>
was a forgery, as stated above<i>.</i> The facts are that the <i>Donation
of Constantine</i> was considered quite genuine for over 700 years, and
during that period <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> would not have been
denied as a papal title by anyone. It might very well have appeared on
a papal mitre or tiara, until the association with 666 was recognized,
after which the tiara(s) would have been modified or destroyed. That
today's Catholic apologists do not want to own up to this historic,
documented and <i>authentic</i> title today, simply does not
invalidate or disqualify it from consideration.</p>

as my article on <a href="666.html"><b>666</b></a> demonstrates. Next,
dare I suggest that recent official lists of papal titles have been
carefully screened to avoid any that add up to 666? Since Patrick
admits that Vicarius Filii Dei is perfectly accurate, and theologically
correct, dare I also suggest that the only reason any Catholic would
reject its legitimacy as a title is <i>only</i> because it <i>does</i>

  <p align="left">My, how sloppy we anti-Catholics are for not reading
and accepting at face value the <i>facts</i> about papal titles in the
1913 <i> Catholic Encyclopedia.</i> Let me point out that Vicarius
Filii Dei and its sum of 666 was apparently first revealed in 1612 by
the rector of Berlin, Andreas Helwig [or Helwich] (1572-1643) in his <i>Antichristus
Romanus</i>. That's 300 years the Catholic Church had to discover that
Vicarius Filii Dei was <i>not</i> something it wanted to lay claim to.
So the fact that the title is not listed by the 1913 <i>Catholic
Encyclopedia</i> three hundred years after its association with 666
comes as no particular surprise to anyone. However, some Catholics were
  <i>still</i> claiming the title in the 20th century, as evidenced by <i>Our
Sunday Visitor</i>. But, as Patrick Madrid discovered after contacting
OSV, their archival copy of the <a href="OSV1915.gif"><b>April 18th,

that the Catholic Church does not claim infallibility for journalists.
So obviously concerned about the blunder being perpetuated, the editor
expunged that issue from the archives. Now this is a, not surprising in

If you have not yet taped this program, but intend to, I would like to
again offer the documentation on my Bible Light web site at
http://www.aloha.net/~mikesch/666.htm for your viewers to see for
themselves that Vicarius Filii Dei is not an Adventist fabrication, as
you claimed, because it appeared repeatedly in historical Catholic
documents for hundreds of years, long before there were any Adventists,
or any Protestants for that matter.<br>
        <br>
You have my permission to make that URL public on your TV program and
Envoy web site. Included are facsimile copies of the Our Sunday Visitor
articles, Prompta Bibliotheca and Catholic Canon Law.<br>

Your viewers will surely appreciate having full access to both sides of
this debate, assuming you are confident enough in your position to
provide the URL of my article for your readers and viewers to see.<br>

        <p>May 7, 2009<br>
Patrick Madrid,<br>
        <br>
I have just recently discovered that a letter of Pope Leo IX to Michael
C�rularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, in 1054, contained Vicarius
Filii Dei. Because of the subsequent schism in 1054, this letter has
great historical significance and is well documented. In his letter,
Leo IX cited a large portion of the <i>Donation of Constantine</i>, to
include Vicarius Filii Dei. The reason that Leo provided the Greek
Patriarch with the bulk of the text of the donation, was to <i>officially</i>
notify him that Emperor Constantine had conferred a unique dignity,
authority and primacy on the See of Peter. Leo IX assured the Patriarch
that the donation was completely genuine, not a fable or old wives
tale, so only the apostolic successor to Peter possessed that primacy
and was the rightful head of all the Church. Details of this letter can
be found on my website at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
 href="666.html#OFFICIAL">
http://biblelight.net/666.htm#OFFICIAL</a> to include links to its full
text available online.<br>
        <br>
I quote you:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"If the person making this claim disputes these facts, ask
him to furnish an example of the alleged title, <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i>,
being used officially by a pope. You won't encounter papal decrees,
conciliar statements, or other authentic, official Catholic documents
in which the pope calls himself the 'Vicar of the Son of God.' Why?
Because no such examples exist. <i>Vicarius Filii Dei</i> has never
been an official title of the pope." (<i>Pope Fiction</i>, pg. 91)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>As this letter of Pope Leo IX has an official status, as
recognized even in the <i>Catholic Encyclopedia,</i> I suggest that
the example you requested in your <i>Pope Fiction </i>has now been
furnished to you. I invite your response, and will be happy to add your

  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">93. Subsequent to my article and no
doubt in response to it, at least one industrious Seventh-Day Adventist
apologist was able to locate examples of variants of the phrase
Vicarius Filii Dei being used in certain official Church documents,
such as Pope Paul VI's 1968 apostolic constitution Bafianae. I
therefore stand corrected in my unduly exclusive assertion that "no"
examples can be found of this phrase. Nonetheless, such
counter-examples notwithstanding, the relatively rare instances of this
usage not only do not rise to the level of being a formal title of the
pope (remember that in the Catholic Encyclopedia's article on papal
titles, Vicarius Filii Dei is conspicuously absent from the list), they
do not vindicate the notion that this obscure and rarely used
description of the pope's office equates with the "the name of the
beast or the number of its name" (Revelation 13: 18).</p>

number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Number of His Name</em>.&#8212;The
number of the beast, says the prophecy, "is the number of a man." If it
is to be derived from a name or title, the natural conclusion would be
that it must be the name or title of some particular or representative
man. The most plausible expression we have seen suggested as containing
the number of the beast, is one of the titles applied to the pope of
Rome. That title is this: <em> Vicarius Filii Dei</em>, "Vicegerent of
the Son of God." It is worthy of note that the Douay Version of the
Bible has the following comment on Revelation 13: 18: "The numeral
letters of his name shall make up this number." Taking the letters out
of this title which are used as Roman numerals, we have V, 5; I, 1; C,
100; I, 1; U (formerly the same as V), 5; I, 1; L, 50; I, 1; I, 1; D,
500; I, 1. Adding these numbers together we have 666.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been argued that the title
of the popes should be reckoned according to the Greek gematria, since
John wrote in Greek, but since the title appears in Latin, and Latin is
the official language of the Church of Rome and the language of its
adopted Bible, the Vulgate, such a procedure would destroy the
numerical value of that title in its own language. It would seem
reasonable that a Latin title should exhibit its Latin numerical values
rather than Greek values.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the practice of representing
names by numbers we read: "It was a method practiced among the
ancients, to denote names by numbers." [43]</p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Representing numbers by letters
of the alphabet gave rise to a practice among the ancients of
representing names also by numbers. Examples of this kind abound in the
writings of heathens, Jews, and Christians." [44]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was a method practiced among
the ancients, to denote names by numbers: as the name of <em>Thouth</em>
or the Egyptian Mercury was signified by the number 1218. . . . It hath
been the usual method in all God's dispensations, for the Holy Spirit
to accommodate His expressions to the customs, fashions, and manners of
the several ages. since then this art and mystery of numbers was so
much used among the ancients, it is less wonderful that the beast also
should have his number, and his number is 666." [45]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This title, <em>Vicarius Filii Dei</em>,
or some equivalent form of it, has appeared so frequently in Roman
Catholic literature and rituals for centuries, that it scarcely seems
necessary to add other proof of its validity and importance. Some of
the variations of the title are: Vicar of Christ, Vicar of Jesus
Christ, Vicar of God. A quotation from the noted Cardinal Manning
illustrates these various forms of the same title:</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So in like manner they say now,
'See this Catholic Church, this Church of God, feeble and weak,
rejected even by the very nations called Catholics. There is Catholic
France, and Catholic Germany, and Catholic Italy, giving up this
exploded figment of the temporal power of the <em>Vicar of Jesus Christ</em>,'
And so, because the Church seems weak, and the <em>Vicar of the Son of
God</em> is renewing the Passion of his Master upon earth, therefore we
are scandalized, therefore we turn our faces from him." [46] (Italic
ours.)</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several other variations of this
title are used elsewhere in the same book.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the importance of the pope's
position as indicated by the title under consideration, or its
equivalents, we quote from</p>

  <p align="left">J. A. Wylie, in his comment on the Apology of
Ennodius written in defense of Pope Symmachus:</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We find the council [of Rome,
A.D. 502 or 503] convoked by Theodoric demurring to investigate the
charges alleged against Pope Symmachus, on the grounds set forth by his
apologist Ennodius, which were, 'that the Pope, as God's Vicar, was the
judge of all, and could himself be judged by no one.' 'In this
apology,' remarks Mosheim, 'the reader will perceive that the
foundations of that enormous power which the popes of Rome afterwards
acquired were now laid.' " [47]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, the validity of
this title has been questioned, but historical evidence remains that
this arrogated title has served to support the authority of the popes
in building up their vast temporal supremacy during the heyday of
Romanism in medieval times, and in maintaining their spiritual
authority to this day.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The particular title <em>Vicarius
Filii Dei</em> appeared as early as 752-774 in a document historically
known as the "Donation of Constantine." Though this document was later
proved to have been written by someone else and signed with the name of
Constantine the Great to give it the weight of his authority&#8212;a practice
not uncommon in medieval times&#8212;yet this so-called Donation of
Constantine was used as valid by at least nine of the popes over a
period of seven centuries or more in establishing the spiritual and
temporal supremacy of the bishops of Rome.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The title itself was obviously an
invention to designate the office of Peter as the first pope in harmony
with the widely known claim of the Roman Catholic Church that the words
of Jesus in Matthew 16: 18, 19, conferred upon Peter the first
bishopric of the church&#8212;a view which Protestants have never allowed&#8212;and
that this bishopric descended to his successors in the papal seat, as
stated in the Donation of Constantine and maintained by the church to
this day. [48]</p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The document employing the title
was confirmed by a church council, says Binius, a high Roman Catholic
dignitary of Cologne, quoted by Labbe and Cossart. [49] It was
incorporated in Roman Catholic canon law by Gratian, and when this
last-named work was revised and published, with endorsement by Pope
Gregory XIII, the title was retained. [50] When Lucius Ferraris wrote
his elaborate theological work about 1755, he gave under the article
"Papa" the title Vicarius Filii Dei, and cited the revised canon law as
his authority. Again when Ferraris's work was revised and enlarged, and
published in Rome in 1890, the document and title were still retained.
[51]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Ferraris's theological work
just cited, the <em>Catholic Encylopedia</em> says that it "will ever
remain a precious mine of information." [52]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote herewith from the Latin
of the Donation of Constantine, confirmed by a church council,
incorporated in Roman Catholic canon law, and cited by Ferraris:</p>
  <p align="left">"Ut sicut Beatus Petrus in terris Vicarius Filii Dei
fuit constitutus, ita et Pontifices eius successores in terris
principatus postestatem amplius, quam terrenae imperialis nostrae
serenitatis mansuetudo habere videtur." [53]</p>
  <p align="left">Christopher Coleman translates this paragraph from
the Canon law of Gratian as follows:</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As the blessed Peter is seen to
have been constituted Vicar of the Son of God on the earth, so the
pontiffs who are the representatives of that same chief of the
apostles, should obtain from us and our empire the power of a supremacy
greater than the clemency of our earthy imperial serenity." [54]</p>
