        <h3><br>III. The Final Purification, or Purgatory</h3>
        <p><strong>1030</strong> All who die in God's grace and friendship, but 
        still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal 
        salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve 
        the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.</p>
        <p><strong>1031</strong> The Church gives the name <em>Purgatory</em> to 
        this final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from 
        the punishment of the damned. (604) The Church formulated her doctrine 
        of faith on Purgatory especially at the Councils of Florence and Trent. 
        The tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, 
        speaks of a cleansing fire: (605)</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>As for certain lesser faults, we must believe that, before the 
          Final Judgment, there is a purifying fire. He who is truth says that 
          whoever utters blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will be pardoned 
          neither in this age nor in the age to come. From this sentence we 
          understand that certain offenses can be forgiven in this age, but 
          certain others in the age to come. (606)</p></blockquote>
        <p><strong>1032</strong> This teaching is also based on the practice of 
        prayer for the dead, already mentioned in Sacred Scripture: "Therefore 
        [Judas Maccabeus] made atonement for the dead, that they might be 
        delivered from their sin."(607) From the beginning the Church has 
        honored the memory of the dead and offered prayers in suffrage for them, 
        above all the Eucharistic sacrifice, so that, thus purified, they may 
        attain the beatific vision of God.(608) The Church also commends 
        almsgiving, indulgences, and works of penance undertaken on behalf of 
        the dead:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Let us help and commemorate them. If Job's sons were purified by 
          their father's sacrifice, why would we doubt that our offerings for 
          the dead bring them some consolation? Let us not hesitate to help 
          those who have died and to offer our prayers for them. 
        (609)</p></blockquote>

  <p>So now let's examine each of the above references in some detail, beginning 
  with the scriptural-</p>
  <blockquote><strong>
    <p>(#605) 1 Corinthians 3:15</strong></p>
    <p>1 Cor 3:6 I [Paul]&nbsp;have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the 
    increase<br>1 Cor 3:7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither 
    he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. <br>1 Cor 3:8 Now he 
    that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his 
    own reward according to his own labour. <br>1 Cor 3:9 For we are labourers 
    together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. <br>1 Cor 
    3:10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise 
    masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But 
    let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.<br>1 Cor 3:11 For other 
    foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br>1 Cor 
    3:12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious 
    stones, wood, hay, stubble;<br>1 Cor 3:13 Every man's work shall be made 
    manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by 
    fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.<br>1 Cor 
    3:14 If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive 
    a reward.<br>1 Cor 3:15 If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer 
    loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p></blockquote>
  <p>This passage refers to building the church of God upon the foundation of 
  Paul's preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The day will come (v. 13) when 
  this work will come into judgment, and be appropriately rewarded (vs. 8, 
  14).&nbsp; Scripture tells us exactly when these rewards are given out:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:12 <font color="#ff0000">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward 
    is with me, to give every man according as his work shall 
  be.</font></p></blockquote>
    <p>Paul also clarifies this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, 
    who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make 
    manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of 
    God.</p></blockquote>
  <p>At the second coming of Jesus, the day of the Lord, that is the day He 
  rewards all those who have participated in building His church, and are 
  saved.&nbsp;Rev 22:12 clearly states every man (the faithful servants in the 
  parable of the talents, Matt 25:21, 23, and the parable of the pounds, Luke 
  19:12-27)&nbsp;is rewarded only when Christ returns. The parable of the 
  laborers in the vineyard (Matt 20) also teaches that compensation is given to 
  everyone as a group, at the end. Paul in 1 Cor 3:12-15 
  also alludes to the second coming of Christ as described in Malachi:</p>
  <blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>Mal 3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when 
    he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: 
    <br>Mal 3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he 
    shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they 
    may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</p>
    <p>Mal 4:1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all 
    the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that 
    cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them 
    neither root nor branch. (see also v. 5)</p></blockquote>
  <p dir="ltr">Only the quality profitable work of the faithful servant, 
  represented by gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor 3:12), will merit 
  reward:</p>
  <blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>Rom 2:6 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:&nbsp;<br>Rom 
    2:7 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and 
    honour and immortality, eternal life: </p></blockquote>
  <p dir="ltr">Unprofitable work that did not advance, or hindered the Gospel, is 
  represented by wood, hay, and stubble, and will be worthless, unrewarded. The 
  corresponding punishment of all the wicked occurs on another day, at the great 
  white throne judgment after the millennium:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the 
    books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: 
    and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the 
    books, according to their works.<br>Rev 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead 
    which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in 
    them: and they were judged every man according to their 
works.</p></blockquote>
  <p>So, it should be clear from the testimony of Malachi 3:2-3, Matthew 20 &amp; 25, 
  Luke 19:12-27, and Revelation 22:12 that 1 Corinthians 3:6-15 refers to 
  rewarding all the righteous <a

  the day of the Lord</a>, at the second coming, not a condition&nbsp;or place 
  of purification or burning purgatory immediately after one dies (<a 
  href="http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1022.htm">"particular 
  judgment"</a>)&nbsp;as taught by the Catholic Church.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p><strong>(#605) 1 Peter 1:7</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which 
    according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by 
    the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<br>1 Pet 1:4 To an 
    inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved 
    in heaven for you,<br>1 Pet 1:5 Who are kept by the power of God through 
    faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.<br>1 Pet 1:6 
    Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in 
    heaviness through manifold temptations:<br>1 Pet 1:7 That the trial of your 
    faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be 
    tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the 
    appearing of Jesus Christ:</p></blockquote>
  <p>In context, verse 7 speaks of <em>one's faith</em> being tried or tested by 
  the temptations and trials of <em>this life</em>, as is clear from verse 6. 
  This does not even hint at a refining or purifying after death as defined by 
  the doctrine of purgatory.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p><strong>(#606) Matthew 12:31</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall 
    be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be 
    forgiven unto men.<br>Mat 12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the 
    Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the 
    Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in 
    the world to come.</p></blockquote>
  <p>The unpardonable sin is shutting out the Holy Spirit from your life, and 
  thereby rejecting the Gospel message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Those 
  who shut out God will not find forgiveness, not during their life, 
  and&nbsp;not on&nbsp;judgment day. God can do nothing for those who have 
  rejected Him in this life. Matthew is simply saying there is no second chance 
  at forgiveness after death, that those who die without faith in Christ cannot 
  be saved. This passage, again, says nothing about a purging of sins by literal 
  fire after death, and therefore does not support the doctrine of purgatory in 
  the slightest degree.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p><strong>(#609) Job 1:5 - from the New American Bible for 
  Catholics</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Job 1:5 And when each feast had run its course, Job would send for them 
    and sanctify them, rising early and offering holocausts for every one of 
    them. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and blasphemed God 
    in their hearts." This Job did habitually.</p></blockquote>
  <p>Job was acting as the patriarchal head, or priest of the household, and 
  summoning his sons to be sanctified before God through sacrifices and 
  offerings. This he was doing for his <em>living</em> sons. It does 
  <em>not</em> speak to similar ceremonies for the dead and any attempts to do 
  so from this verse are pure invention and speculation.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p>That exhausts the scriptural references to the 66 books recognized by the 
  Protestant world as inspired of God. The complete lack of any evidence to 
  support purgatory in these verses should be apparent to even a casual reader. 
  Now on to the deuterocanonical or apocryphal reference-</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p><strong>(#607) 2 Maccabees 12:46</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Therefore [Judas Maccabeus] made atonement for the dead, that they might 
    be delivered from their sin.</p></blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to the claim of the Roman Catholic Church, 2 Maccabees is 
  <em>not</em> inspired sacred scripture. It is interesting to note that all the 
  apocryphal or deuterocanonical books that Trent declared to be canon in the 
  16th century were <em>OLD TESTAMENT</em> era writings. The mere fact that it 
  took the church over 1500 years to declare the canon in an ecumenical council, 
  and that this occurred during the time of the Reformation, should raise some 
  not so subtle hints as to motivation. The Council of Trent included 2 
  Maccabees as canon because of the above verse. At a time when the Catholic 
  Church was under attack by the Protestants as the apostate church, it sought 
  support for the practice of indulgences, purgatory and prayer to Mary and 
  saints, and found it in 2 Maccabees.</p>
  <p>The act of canonizing the apocryphal books was intended as a declaration of 
  the church's assumed authority over scripture, to which the Protestant looked 
  as his <em>only</em> authority for doctrine. This was intended to make the 
  church the defacto authority over what the Protestant believed. It was plainly 
  an act of politics in reaction to the Reformation. Protestants responded by 
  not recognizing the apocryphal books as inspired, though they were sometimes 
  included in early Protestant Bibles as worthy of study. Since 2 Maccabees 
  <em>is not, and never has been inspired scripture</em>, quoting it is quite 
  useless for establishing any doctrine at all.</p>
  <p>The situation is quite the same for the following references to Church 
  Councils and Papal decrees on purgatory, which have no biblical authority 
  behind them either-</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p><strong>(#604) Council of Florence (1439 A.D.): DS 1304</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[<em>De novissimis</em>] It has likewise defined, that, if those truly 
    penitent have departed in the love of God, before they have made 
    satisfaction by worthy fruits of penance for sins of commission and 
    omission, the souls of these are cleansed after death by purgatorial 
    punishments; and so that they may be released from punishments of this kind, 
    the suffrages of the living faithful are of advantage to them, namely, the 
    sacrifices of Masses, prayers, and almsgiving, and other works of piety, 
    which are customarily performed by the faithful for other faithful according 
    to the institutions of the Church.</p></blockquote>
  <p>Source: <em>The Companion to the Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>, 
  Ignatius Press, copyright 1994, page 406.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p>The essence of purgatory should be fairly clear at this point. In a 
  nutshell it is this - people that are to be saved and are heaven bound, but 
  still have remaining sins for which they have not paid enough of a penalty, 
  suffer a cleansing punishment by fire in purgatory before entering heaven. In 
  a sense, purgatory is a mini-version of the Catholic view of Hell, a place of 
  fiery torment and suffering - and this, by Catholic teaching, awaits <i>the 
  faithful believer in Jesus Christ!</i> The length of time one might stay in 
  purgatory, as taught by the Roman Catholic Church, can be shortened by the 
  actions of concerned faithful people on earth, through various Church approved 
  methods.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="40%">

  <p><strong>(#604) Council of Trent, 25th Session, (1563 A.D.): DS 
  1820</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>DECREE CONCERNING PURGATORY</strong></p>
    <p>Since the Catholic Church, instructed by the Holy Spirit, in conformity 
    with the sacred writings and the ancient tradition of the Fathers in sacred 
    councils, and very recently in this ecumenical Synod, has taught that there 
    is a purgatory, and that the souls detained there are assisted by the 
    suffrages of the faithful, and especially by the acceptable sacrifice of the 
    altar, the holy Synod commands the bishops that they insist that the sound 
    doctrine of purgatory, which has been transmitted by the holy Fathers and 
    holy Councils, be believed by the faithful of Christ, be maintained, taught, 
    and everywhere preached. Let the more difficult and subtle "questions," 
    however, and those which do not make for "edification" [cf. 1 Tim 1:4], and 
    from which there is very often no increase in piety, be excluded from 
    popular discourses to uneducated people. Likewise, let them not permit 
    uncertain matters, or those that have the appearance of falsehood, to be 
    brought out and discussed publicly. Those matters on the contrary, which 
    tend to a certain curiosity or superstition, or that savor of filthy lucre, 
    let them prohibit as scandals and stumbling blocks to the 
  faithful.</p></blockquote>

    <p>The Bishops shall see to it that the suffrages of the living, that is, 
    the sacrifice of the mass, prayers, alms, and other works of piety which 
    they have been accustomed to perform for the faithful departed, be piously 
    and devoutly discharged in accordance with the laws of the Church, and that 
    whatever is due on their behalf from testamentary bequests or other ways, be 
    discharged by the priests and ministers of the Church and others who are 
    bound to render this service not in a perfunctory manner, but diligently and 
    accurately.</p></blockquote>

  <p>The above decree declares purgatory will be believed by the Catholic, and 
  it will be taught and preached as truth, but in-depth discussions as to the 
  fine points and seeking proof from scripture is to be discouraged among the 
  ignorant and unwashed laity. That the Church declares it, is to be considered 
  sufficient proof in itself. The Church will also be diligent in carrying out 
  those acts of piety (like claiming a portion, if not all, of the dear 
  departed's estate for the Church) which will aid those in purgatory, and 
  shorten their time of suffering there.</p>

  <p>This one is quite simply amazing. They are quite determined to see that 
  virtually every one of the faithful fry in the fires and torment of purgatory 
  while on their way to heaven, aren't they! The reason for this will be made 
  clear shortly. If anyone dares to even suggest that forgiveness and 
  justification from Jesus Christ is sufficient to completely and forever blot 
  out one's sins, such that the former sinner shall not require further 
  punishment in purgatory prior to entering heaven, then let the heretic be 
  condemned for even thinking or suggesting such a thing. What does scripture 
  say about forgiveness?-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name 
    JESUS: for <strong>he shall save his people from their sins.</strong></p>
    <p>Mark 3:28 Verily I say unto you, <strong>All sins shall be forgiven unto 
    the sons of men</strong>, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall 
    blaspheme:</p>
    <p>Col 2:13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your 
    flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having <strong>forgiven you all 
    trespasses</strong>;</p>
    <p>Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of 
    you in the name of Jesus Christ <strong>for the remission of sins</strong>, 
    and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
    <p>Acts 10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name 
    <strong>whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of 
    sins.</strong></p>
    <p>1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us 
    our sins, and to <strong>cleanse us from all unrighteousness</strong>.</p>
    <p>Rev 1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first 
    begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him 
    that loved us, and <strong>washed us from our sins in his own 
    blood</strong>,</p></blockquote>
  <p>Even from these few verses, it should be clear that the people of God have 
  their sins totally forgiven. They will not have to suffer for them in some 
  purgatory, since Jesus Christ bore our sins on the cross. He has paid the 
  <strong>total</strong> price for our sins! To suggest we must suffer in 
  purgatory for our sins implies that the price Jesus paid was 
  <em>incomplete</em><em style="FONT-STYLE: normal">, which directly contradicts 
  scripture:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em style="FONT-STYLE: normal">Heb 1:1 God, who at sundry times and in 
    divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,<br>Heb 
    1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath 
    appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;<br>Heb 1:3 
    Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, 
    and upholding all things by the word of his power, when <b>he [Jesus Christ]

  <blockquote>
    <p>By this edict which will prevail forever, with apostolic authority we 
    declare: that according to the common arrangement of God, souls of all the 
    saints who departed from this world before the passion of our Lord Jesus 
    Christ; also of the holy apostles, the martyrs, the confessors, virgins, and 
    the other faithful who died after the holy baptism of Christ had been 
    received by them, in whom nothing was to be purged, when they departed, nor 
    will there be when they shall depart also in the future; or if then there 
    was or there will be anything to be purged in these when after their death 
    they have been purged; and the souls of children departing before the use of 
    free will, reborn and baptized in that same baptism of Christ, when all have 
    been baptized, immediately after their death and the aforesaid purgation in 
    those who were in need of a purgation of this kind, even before the 
    resumption of their bodies and the general judgment after the ascension of 
    our Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, into heaven, have been, are, and will be 
    in heaven, in the kingdom of heaven and in celestial paradise with Christ, 
    united in the company of the holy angels, and after the passion and death of 
    our Lord Jesus Christ have seen and see the divine essence by intuitive 
    vision, and even face to face, with no mediating creature, serving in the 
    capacity of an object seen, but divine essence immediately revealing itself 
    plainly, clearly, and openly to them, and seeing thus they enjoy the same 
    divine essence, and also that that from such vision and enjoyment their 
    souls, which now have departed, are truly blessed and they have eternal life 
    and rest; and also [the souls] of those who afterwards will depart, will see 
    the same divine essence, and will enjoy it before the general 
    judgment....</p></blockquote>

  <p>This one is a real mouthful. From what I can unscramble, it is saying that 
  everyone who qualifies either by living a holy life, or by being purged in 
  purgatory after a not so holy life, will be in the presence of God before the 
  general judgment. That is to say, in a nutshell, purgatory will end for 
  everyone stuck there before the final resurrection and judgment.</p>

  <p>Now, just how hot do you think the cleansing fires of this purgatory might 
  be? Just how much do those on the way to heaven really suffer?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Thomas Aquinas held that the least pain in purgatory was greater than the 
    worst in this life. Bonaventure said the worst suffering after death was 
    greater than the worst on earth, but the same could not be said regarding 
    the least purgatorial suffering.</p>
    <p>Most Catholic theologians hold, with Bellarmine, that in some way the 
    pains of purgatory are greater than those on earth.</p></blockquote>

    <p>As regards the intensity of the suffering, Bellarmine, a noted Roman 
    Catholic theologian, says:</p>
    <p>"The pains in purgatory are very severe, surpassing anything endured in 
    this life."</p>
    <p>The Manual of the Purgatorial Society, with the imprimatur of Cardinal 
    Hayes, says:</p>
    <p>"According to the Holy Fathers of the Church, the fire of purgatory does 
    not differ from the fire of hell, except in point of duration.</p>
    <p>'It is the same fire,' says St. Thomas Aquinas, 'that torments the 
    reprobate in hell, and the just in purgatory. The least pain in purgatory,' 
    he says, "surpasses the greatest suffering in this life. ' Nothing but the 
    eternal duration makes the fire of hell more terrible than that of 
    purgatory."</p>
    <p>And in another book with the imprimatur of archbishop Spellman (now 
    Cardinal), Bellarmine is quoted as saying:</p>
    <p>"There is absolutely no doubt that the pains of purgatory in some cases 
    endure for entire centuries" (John M. Haffert, <em>Saturday in 
    Purgatory</em>).</p></blockquote>

    to death in a slow fire? What fear would not be ours if we had to face a 
    similar death? Yet their suffering was of relatively short duration. The 
    incomparably fiercer fire of Purgatory, which we may have to face, may last 
    20, or 50 or 100 years! "</p></blockquote>

  <p>The origins of purgatory are pagan-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In Egypt, substantially the same doctrine of purgatory was inculcated. 
    But when once this doctrine of purgatory was admitted into the popular mind, 
    then the door was opened for all manner of priestly extortions. Prayers for 
    the dead ever go hand in hand with purgatory; but no prayers can be 
    completely efficacious without the interposition of the priests; and no 
    priestly functions can be rendered unless there be special pay for them. 
    Therefore, in every land we find the Pagan priesthood "devouring widow's 
    houses," and making merchandise of the tender feelings of sorrowing 
    relatives, sensitively alive to the immortal happiness of the beloved dead. 
    From all quarters there is one universal testimony as to the burdensome 
    character and the expense of these posthumous devotions.</p></blockquote>
  <p>Source: <em>The Two Babylons</em>, by Rev. Alexander Hislop, Published in 
  America by Loizeaux Brothers, Second Edition, 1959, page 168.</p>
  <p>The above reveals clearly the motivation behind purgatory. What loving 
  person would not give up every earthly possession and every penny they own if 
  they though they could end the torment and suffering of their recently 
  deceased loved one, now thought to be in purgatory? Masses for the dead, 
  indulgences, offerings to the church, etc., are claimed to reduce one's time 
  in purgatory, and can be offered on behalf of the dead for their benefit. 
  Money could easily be extorted from the living, fearing the fire of purgatory, 
  and thinking that they could reduce their torment after death for a price. 
  This is the monstrous fraud that sparked the Reformation when Martin Luther 
  posted the 95 theses on the door of Wittenberg Castle Church. If the Church 
  did have such power as to shorten the time in purgatory, why do they not do it 
  for free? Why must money change hands to effect such relief? This was one of 
  Martin Luther's questions. The answer is simple. Purgatory is the machine that 
  drives the sinner into the Church, and parts them from their money.</p>
  <p>Without the incentive of lessening your burning torment in purgatory, the 
  Church fears it's pews and coffers would be virtually empty. With the laity 
  virtually ignorant of the Bible, the Church could sell their services to every 
  relative of the recently deceased, and extract money indefinitely, indeed for 
  years. How was one to know when God had been satisfied, and the poor suffering 
  sinner released from purgatory to graduate to heaven? What if a relative 
  stopped just short of enough masses, indulgences, etc.? Would the sinner 
  remain in purgatory for the rest of time, simply because there was no one to 
  pay off the priests? Oh, but for that last mass, that last coin in the 
  offering basket!</p>
  <p>Purgatory is a complete fraud, perpetrated on the ignorant and the 
  vulnerable. This is a prime example of how important it is to know and 
  understand from scripture the true state of the dead. The dead remain in the 
  grave, dead, gone, dust, awaiting their resurrection. They are not in heaven, 
  Catholic hell, or Catholic purgatory. They are in the grave, and <em>that is 
  the biblical truth.</em> If you have not read them yet, please read -</p>
