<blockquote>
	<hr>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">[20:48] We need you to get this right.&nbsp; And what’s 
more, you set an example for those who seek a peace of their own.&nbsp; Because 
beyond these shores, right now, in scattered corners of the world, there are 
people living in the grip of conflict -- ethnic conflict, religious conflict, 
tribal conflicts -- and they know something better is out there.&nbsp; And they’re 
groping to find a way to discover how to move beyond the heavy hand of history, 
to put aside the violence.&nbsp; They’re studying what you’re doing.&nbsp; And they’re 
wondering, perhaps if Northern Ireland can achieve peace, we can, too.&nbsp; You’re 
their blueprint to follow.&nbsp; You’re their proof of what is possible -- because 
hope is contagious.&nbsp; They’re watching to see what you do next.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>[21:52] 
Now, some of that is up to your leaders.&nbsp; As someone who knows firsthand how 
politics can encourage division and discourage cooperation, I admire the 
Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Assembly all the more for 
making power-sharing work.&nbsp; That’s not easy to do.&nbsp; It requires compromise, and 
it requires absorbing some pain from your own side.&nbsp; I applaud them for taking 
responsibility for law enforcement and for justice, and I commend their effort 
to “Building a United Community” -- important next steps along your 
transformational journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">[22:36] Because issues like segregated schools and 
housing, lack of jobs and opportunity -- symbols of history that are a source of 
pride for some and pain for others -- these are not tangential to peace; they’re 
essential to it.&nbsp; If towns remain divided -- if Catholics have their schools and 
buildings, and Protestants have theirs -- if we can’t see ourselves in one 
another, if fear or resentment are allowed to harden, that encourages division.&nbsp; 
It discourages cooperation.&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/17/remarks-president-obama-and-mrs-obama-town-hall-youth-northern-ireland">Remarks
