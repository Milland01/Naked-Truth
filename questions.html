  <hr>
  <p>The following set of questions was received (and replied to) on December
  11th, 1999, from the Catholic editors at <a

        <td>Michael says &quot;It is NOT really my intent to offend
          anyone..&quot; Its hard to see how his website could not offend. He
          offers the challenge &quot;So if you are offended, or feel that what I
          have posted is in error, then please write me and explain in some
          detail where you feel I have erred. I am willing to consider your
          point of view.&quot;
          <p>With this in mind the esteemed editors at R_Catholic-L wrote
          Michael Scheifler.</p>
          <p>Dear Michael,</p>
          <p>As a Catholic, its hard to see how a reasonable person of any
          denomination would not be offended by your website, especially
          Catholics. You invited website visitors to write you. I am extending
          you the opportunity to give Catholics an insight to how a notable
          anti-Catholic feels about Catholics. I am writing these questions for
          Catholics and this article will be posted in its entirety for
          Catholics to read. You can also view this document at <a
          href="http://rcatholic-l.freeservers.com/michael.html">http://rcatholic-l.freeservers.com/michael.html</a>.</p>
          <p>1. Do you hate Catholics?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>No. Do you hate what you call anti-Catholics? Why do Catholics
  automatically assume that they are hated by those who disagree strongly with
  Catholic doctrines and teaching?</p>
  <p>If I were to walk down a street and see a neighbor's house on fire, what do
  you think I should do? Any responsible person would immediately try to give a
  warning and get anyone in the house to leave because of the clear danger. Now,
  if I really hated the people in that house, I might, in my hatred, do nothing
  and let them perish in the fire. Surely to do nothing would be the worst
  possible outcome. Now make the house the Catholic Church, and the fire is
  apostate doctrine. I know from scripture that this apostasy is quite
  dangerous, and could be fatal. What am I to do, try to warn them and get the
  people out, or do nothing? Which is an act of love and concern and not hatred?</p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>2. Most people with deep prejudices often say in their defense
          &quot;I have friends that are black,&quot; or &quot;I have friends
          that are Jewish&quot; as a defense. With this in mind do you have any
          Catholic friends?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>That is a loaded question, but I will answer it anyway. I have many
  ex-Catholics as friends that are now Adventists, but I must admit, I have few
  if any practicing Catholic friends or acquaintances. (At least they have not
  told me they are Catholic, if they are).</p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>3. Do you really feel that Catholics worship statues?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>Catholics will deny it, and I accept them at their word, but the
  commandment of God forbids bowing down in front of images of any kind, and
  this Catholics do routinely, so they are breaking the commandment. It does not
  matter that they deny worshipping the statue/image, bowing down before it is
  an act of idolatry forbidden by God.</p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>4. Would you accept a gold medal from the pope considering that
          Adventists believe he is the antichrist?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>I will take all the gold you or the Pope want to give me and use it for the
  work of the Lord. Did not Israel take all the gold they could carry from
  Pharaoh and Egypt when they left it?</p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>5. Are all Catholics damned?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>Certainly not. In fact, scripture makes clear that the majority of God's
  people are now IN Babylon, and they are to be called out of it:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
    my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of
    her plagues.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That is a message that many Catholics will hear and respond to.</p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>How could a person ask questions of an Adventist and not cover some
          about the late Ellen White?
          <p>1. According to Ellen White there are a race of people who are an
          amalgamation of man and beast. Which race of people is this?</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>&quot;But if there was one sin above another which called for the
            destruction of the race by the flood, it was the base crime of
            amalgamation of man and beast which defaced the image of God, and
            caused confusion everywhere.<br>
            Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p. 64&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Every species of animal which God had created were
            preserved in the ark. The confused species which God did not create,
            which were the result of amalgamation, were destroyed by the flood.
            Since the flood there has been amalgamation of man and beast, as may
            be seen in the almost endless varieties of species of animals, and
            in certain races of men.<br>

  </div>
  <p>You misunderstand what she was saying. She was NOT speaking about
  cross-breeding between animals and humans. Ellen White was speaking about the
  genetic engineering of animals by man, and similarly cross-breeding between
  types of humans. Hitler tried the same kind of manipulation to try and produce
  a super Aryan race. Today there is the same controversy over genetic
  engineering of plants, animals and men. Man today is able by manipulation to
  produce species that were not created by God, and clone animals etc. With
  their superior intellect, the people before the flood were doing the same kind
  of species engineering, and producing &quot;man-made&quot; varieties of
  plants, animals, and yes, perhaps even &quot;super&quot; humans.</p>
  <div align="left">
    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>2. The above shows a extreme racial prejudice to go with White's
          religious prejudices. Many times when people have racial or religious
          prejudices they will defend themselves by saying &quot;I have friends
          that are Catholic,&quot; or &quot;I have friends that are black.
          &quot; Do you have any friends that are the amalgamation of &quot;Man
          and beast&quot;?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>Your question was based on a false assumption, but now you know what Ellen
  White really meant by her remarks, which were not racist at all.</p>

    <table border="0" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#F0F0FF"
    width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>3. Are the inhabitants of Saturn &quot;a tall, majestic people, so
          unlike the inhabitants of earth&quot; as White claimed?</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </div>
  <p>I don't think Ellen White ever spoke of Jupiter [or Saturn, see below] in
  that regard, but she did say this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were given me, and an
    angel attended me from the city to a place that was bright and glorious. The
    grass of the place was living green, and the birds there warbled a sweet
    song. The inhabitants of the place were of all sizes; they were noble,
    majestic, and lovely. They bore the express image of Jesus, and their
    countenances beamed with holy joy, expressive of the freedom and happiness
    of the place. I asked one of them why they were so much more lovely than
    those on the earth. The reply was, &quot;We have lived in strict obedience
    to the commandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience, like those
    on the earth.&quot; Early Writings, pg. 39.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Even scripture speaks of other worlds:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Heb 1:2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath
    appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>
    <p>Heb 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
    word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
    appear.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I have no problem believing that there are indeed other unfallen worlds in
  this universe, worlds that have tall majestic inhabitants, but I don't think
  Ellen White ever said that Jupiter [or Saturn, see below] was inhabited.</p>

  <p align="left">Subsequent to the above exchange I have found the statements
  of Ellen White that undoubtedly prompted the question asked about the planet
  Saturn. Note that Ellen White never names any planets she sees in vision, nor
  does she speak of any inhabitants on them.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>Ellen G. White: The Early Years Volume 1 - 1827-1862</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[pg. 113]</p>
    <p>The Harmon home in Gorham became the place of residence for the
    newlyweds. We know very little of the early weeks of their married life. But
    in November [of 1846] they attended a conference in Topsham some thirty-five
    miles to the north, at the home of Brother Curtis. Joseph Bates had come up
    from New Bedford and was present. Ellen White wrote:</p>
    <p>The Spirit of God rested upon us in Brother C.'s humble dwelling, and I
    was wrapt in a vision of God's glory, and for the first time had a view of
    other planets. After I came out of vision I related what I had seen.-- Ibid
    ., p. 239.</p>
    <p>Actually, during the vision, wholly unbeknown to her, she spoke of what
    was passing before her. J. N. Loughborough recounted in print the
    description of the meeting as Bates told it to him:</p>
    <p>Mrs. White, while in vision, began to talk about the stars, giving a
    glowing description of rosy-tinted belts which she saw across the surface of
    some planet, and added, &quot;I see four moons.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Elder Bates, &quot;she is viewing Jupiter!&quot;
    Then having made motions as though traveling through space, she began giving
    a description of belts and rings in their ever-varying beauty, and said,
    &quot;I see seven moons.&quot;</p>
    <p>Elder Bates exclaimed, &quot;She is describing Saturn.&quot;</p>
    <p>Next came the description of Uranus, with its six moons; then a wonderful
    description of the &quot;opening heavens,&quot; with its glory, calling it
    an opening into a region more enlightened. Elder Bates said that her
    description far surpassed any account of the opening heavens he had ever
    read from any author.</p>
    <p>While she was talking and still in vision, he arose to his feet, and
    exclaimed, &quot;O how I wish Lord John Rosse was here tonight!&quot; Elder
    White inquired, &quot;Who is Lord John Rosse?&quot;</p>
    <p>[pg. 114]</p>
    <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Elder Bates, &quot;he is the great English
    astronomer. I wish he was here to hear that woman talk astronomy, and to
    hear that description of the 'opening heavens.' It is ahead of anything I
    ever read on the subject.&quot;--GSAM, p. 258.</p>
    <p>Ellen White reported of this experience in the Curtis home:</p>
    <p>After I came out of vision I related what I had seen. Elder Bates then
    asked if I had studied astronomy. I told him I had no recollection of ever
    looking into an astronomy.</p>
    <p>Said he, &quot;This is of the Lord.&quot;</p>
    <p>I never saw him as free and happy before. His countenance shone with the
    light of heaven, and he exhorted the church with power.--1LS, p. 239.</p>
    <p>A few months later James White wrote: At our conference in Topsham,
    Maine, last November, Ellen had a vision of the handiworks of God. She was
    guided to the planets Jupiter, Saturn, and I think one more.[* ELLEN WHITE,
    NEITHER IN VISION NOR AFTERWARD, GAVE THE NAMES OF THE PLANETS SHE SAW. FROM
    HER DESCRIPTIONS BATES IDENTIFIED THEM AND JAMES WHITE MADE USE OF HIS
    IDENTIFICATION.] After she came out of vision, she could give a clear
    description of their moons, et cetera. It is well known that she knew
    nothing of astronomy, and could not answer one question in relation to the
    planets, before she had this vision.--WLF, p. 22.</p>
  </blockquote>

  href="http://www.egwestate.andrews.edu/issues/faq-unus.html#unusual-section-c2">Astronomical
  Statements of Ellen White</a> at the E. G. White Estate web site.</p>
  <p>The quotation from Early Writings that I previously cited also appears in <i>The
  Early Years Volume 1 - 1827-1862, </i>page 156, and concerns a separate vision
  she apparently had Dec. 16, 1848 which was published in 1849. Here is a <a
