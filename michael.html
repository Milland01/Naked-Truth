<p><font size="5">MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL ..... JESUS?</font></p>
</center></strong><hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>To begin, let's look at the phrase *angel of the LORD* in the story of 
  Moses and the burning bush-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 3:2 And the *angel of the LORD* appeared unto him in a flame of fire 
    out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with 
    fire, and the bush was not consumed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now in verses four and six, who is identified as being in the bush?- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called 
    unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, 
    Here am I.</p>
    <p>Exo 3:6 Moreover he said, *I am* the God of thy father, the God of 
    Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for 
    he was afraid to look upon God. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that the angel (messenger) of verse 2 is really none other than God 
  Himself. This is confirmed in the New Testament-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 7:30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the 
    wilderness of mount Sina an *angel of the Lord* in a flame of fire in a 
    bush.<br>
    Acts 7:31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near 
    to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now note the following- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children 
    of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me 
    unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto 
    them?<br>
    Exo 3:14 And God said unto Moses, *I AM* THAT *I AM*: and he said, Thus 
    shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, *I AM* hath sent me unto you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When asked what His name is, the God of the patriarchs of the Old Testament 
  replies *I AM*. Now look again in the New Testament-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 7:32 Saying, *I am* the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and 
    the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not 
    behold.</p>
    <p>John 8:57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, 
    and hast thou seen Abraham?<br>
    John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before 
    Abraham was, *I am*. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ had just identified Himself as the One who is the God of the 
  Old Testament patriarchs, who was present in the burning bush speaking to 
  Moses. Just for extra measure-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 18:4 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, 
    went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?<br>
    John 18:5 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, *I 
    am* he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.<br>
    John 18:6 As soon then as he had said unto them, *I am* he, they went 
    backward, and fell to the ground.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus Christ again makes it clear He is the *I am*. Merely speaking the 
  words made those present fall over. So the *angel of the Lord* and Jesus are 
  identical to, and synonymous with, the *I am* that met Moses at the burning 
  bush.</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Now look at the story of Hagar in Genesis- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 16:7 And the *angel of the LORD* found her by a fountain of water in 
    the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</p>
    <p>Gen 16:9 And the *angel of the LORD* said unto her, Return to thy 
    mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.<br>
    Gen 16:10 And the *angel of the LORD* said unto her, I will multiply thy 
    seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.<br>
    Gen 16:11 And the *angel of the LORD* said unto her, Behold, thou art with 
    child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the 
    LORD hath heard thy affliction.<br>
    Gen 16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and 
    every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his 
    brethren.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Hagar has been visited and spoken to by the *angel of the Lord*, but look 
  who she says it was-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou 
    God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again the *angel of the Lord* is actually none other than the LORD Jesus 
  Christ Himself. Now a little later in Genesis-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the *angel of God* 
    called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? 
    fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.<br>
    Gen 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will 
    make him a great nation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who would make a great nation of the lad? Surely not a mere angel, but 
  actually Jesus Christ Himself.</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Now let's look at the story of Abraham and Isaac- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt 
    Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.<br>
    Gen 22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou 
    lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a 
    burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>God speaks to Abraham, giving him instructions to follow. Look who speaks 
  to Abraham next-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 22:11 And the *angel of the LORD* called unto him out of heaven, and 
    said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</p>
    <p>Gen 22:15 And the *angel of the LORD* called unto Abraham out of heaven 
    the second time,<br>
    Gen 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou 
    hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:<br>
    Gen 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will 
    multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon 
    the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;<br>
    Gen 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 
    because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who will bless Abraham and multiply his seed? Notice the transition from 
  *angel of the LORD* in verse 15 to the LORD (Jesus Christ) in verse 16?</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Now on to Jacob-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 31:11 And the *angel of God* spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: 
    And I said, Here am I.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who does this messenger identify Himself as?-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and 
    where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, 
    and return unto the land of thy kindred.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This vow of Jacob's is found in Gen 28-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will 
    keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to 
    put on,<br>
    Gen 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the 
    LORD be my God:<br>
    Gen 28:22 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's 
    house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto 
    thee.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the *angel of God* of Gen 31:11 is again none other than the LORD God 
  (Jesus Christ).</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Now to the Israelites in the wilderness-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 14:19 And *the angel of God*, which went before the camp of Israel, 
    removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before 
    their face, and stood behind them:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who went before them?-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to 
    lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to 
    go by day and night:</p>
    <p>Zec 12:8 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
    and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the 
    house of David shall be as God, [that is] as the angel of the LORD before 
    them.</p>
    <p>Neh 9:7 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest 
    him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;<br>
    Neh 9:8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant 
    with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and 
    the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, 
    to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:<br>
    Neh 9:9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest 
    their cry by the Red sea;<br>
    Neh 9:10 And showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his 
    servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they 
    dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this 
    day.<br>
    Neh 9:11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went 
    through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou 
    threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.<br>
    Neh 9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in 
    the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they 
    should go.<br>
    Neh 9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from 
    heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and 
    commandments:<br>
    Neh 9:14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them 
    precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:<br>
    Neh 9:15 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest 
    forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them 
    that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give 
    them.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 10:1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, 
    how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the 
    sea;<br>
    1 Cor 10:2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;<br>
    1 Cor 10:3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat;<br>
    1 Cor 10:4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of 
    that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Again, the messenger or *angel of God* is the same as the LORD (Jesus 
  Christ).</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Now in the story of Balaam, we begin with God speaking directly to Balaam-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Num 22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the 
    men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I 
    shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Then a transition from God to *angel of the LORD*-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Num 22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the *angel of 
    the LORD* stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding 
    upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So guess who was standing before Balaam? None other than Jesus Christ. The 
  *angel of the LORD* is used many times in verses 23,24,25,26,31,32,34,35 and 
  the LORD in verses 28,31. Then continuing in Chapter 23 God meets Balaam in 
  verse 4 and the LORD is mentioned in verses 5 and 16. These titles are being 
  used interchangeably. In each case it is again referring to the LORD Jesus 
  Christ.</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Now in the book of Judges-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 2:1 And an *angel of the LORD* came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and 
    said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land 
    which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant 
    with you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By now this should be easy. Just who brought the Israelites out of Egypt 
  and made the covenant with Israel that He would never break - *an angel of the 
  LORD* or Jesus Christ, GOD Himself? Yes, the answer is both, one and the same.</p>
  <p>Now look who visits Gideon later in Judges-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 6:11 And there came an *angel of the LORD*, and sat under an oak 
    which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son 
    Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note what this messenger (angel) says-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 6:12 And the *angel of the LORD* appeared unto him, and said unto 
    him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>THE LORD IS WITH THEE ... it was indeed Jesus with Gideon, note-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 6:20 And the *angel of God* said unto him, Take the flesh and the 
    unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And 
    he did so.<br>
    Judg 6:21 Then the *angel of the LORD* put forth the end of the staff that 
    was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there 
    rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened 
    cakes. Then the *angel of the LORD* departed out of his sight.<br>
    Judg 6:22 And when Gideon perceived that he was an *angel of the LORD*, 
    Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an *angel of the 
    LORD* face to face.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now look who (again) speaks-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 6:23 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou 
    shalt not die.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Gideon had been speaking with the LORD Jesus Christ all along.</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>On to Judges 13-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 13:3 And the *angel of the LORD* appeared unto the woman, and said 
    unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt 
    conceive, and bear a son.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>*Angel of God/the Lord* appears in verses 9,13, and 15-18.<br>
  Note what Manoah asks in verse 17 and the answer in verse 18:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 13:17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, 
    that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?<br>
    Judg 13:18 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus 
    after my name, seeing it is secret?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Hebrew word translated &quot;secret&quot; in the King James (H6383) also can mean 
  &quot;wonderful&quot;. Note that this is a title for Jesus:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the 
    government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called 
    Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of 
    Peace.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So who had Manoah and his wife been speaking with?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Judg 13:21 But the *angel of the LORD* did no more appear to Manoah and 
    to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an *angel of the LORD*.<br>
    Judg 13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we 
    have seen God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the instances I have cited, the phrase *angel of the LORD* or *angel of 
  God* actually meant Jesus Christ, who is the *chief messenger (angel) of the 
  LORD (God the Father)*.</p>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>Here is a further text to consider-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon 
    Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, 
    guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.<br>
    Gen 48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers 
    Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this 
    day,<br>
    Gen 48:16 The *Angel which redeemed me* from all evil, bless the lads; and 
    let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; 
    and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that Israel was talking about God and then transitioned to an angel-</p>
  <p>God, --- before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk<br>
  God --- which fed me all my life long unto this day<br>
  The *Angel --- which redeemed me* from all evil<br>
  (*the Angel* that) --- bless the lads; and let my name be named on them<br>
  (*the Angel* that) --- let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the 
  earth</p>
  <p>This is referring back to Gen 28:13-15 and the Lord's promise to Jacob 
  (Israel)-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD 
    God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, 
    to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;<br>
    Gen 28:14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt 
    spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the 
    south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be 
    blessed.<br>
    Gen 28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places 
    whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not 
    leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.<br>
    Gen 28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is 
    in this place; and I knew it not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So in Gen 48:16 Israel is speaking of God as a redeeming angel. Again, not 
  angel the sense of a created being, but rather in the generic sense of the 
  word, meaning messenger. What created angel could redeem anyone? None. 
  Redemption is found only in Jesus Christ, the very Son of God, and that is 
  exactly who Jacob (Israel) had been speaking with and about. Jesus was, and 
  is, that redeeming angel (messenger) sent from God the Father. A similar 
  passage referring to Jesus as a redeeming angel is in Isaiah:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 63:7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises 
    of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the 
    great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them 
    according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his 
    lovingkindnesses.<br>
    Isa 63:8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: 
    so he was their Saviour.<br>
    Isa 63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his 
    presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he 
    bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p>In Daniel, when the three Hebrew boys were cast into the fiery furnace for 
  not bowing down to the golden statue, not three but four figures were seen in 
  the furnace:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 3:25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the 
    midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like 
    the Son of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now most Christians would agree that this was indeed Jesus Christ, the Son 
  of God, who walked with them in the furnace, in a pre-incarnation appearance. 
  Yet, verse 28, interestingly enough, describes the fourth figure as an <i>
  angel</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 3:28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of 
    Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his *angel*, and delivered 
    his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and 
    yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except 
    their own God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr width="40%">
  <p><b><u>The Angel of the Covenant</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 3:1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way 
    before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, 
    even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall 
    come, saith the LORD of hosts.<br>
    Mal 3:2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he 
    appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:<br>
    Mal 3:3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall 
    purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may 
    offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The messenger of the covenant spoken of here in Malachi is clearly a 
  reference to Jesus Christ, and His first and second coming. The word 
  translated as <i>messenger </i>in Mal 3:1 is the same word [H4397, mal'ak] 
  used in the previous passages of the old testament where we saw the phrase <i>
  angel of the Lord. </i>So this would also be a proper translation:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mal 3:1 Behold, I will send my <b>angel</b>, and he shall prepare the way 
    before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, 
    even the <b>angel of the covenant</b>, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall 
    come, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In fact, this is how the Catholic Douay Rheims Bible translates this verse:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center">CHAPTER 3.</p>
    <p align="left"><i><font size="2">Christ shall come to his temple, and 
    purify the priesthood. They that continue in their evil ways shall be 
    punished: but true penitents shall receive a blessing.</font></i></p>
    <p>Mal 3:1 Behold* I send my angel, and he shall prepare the way before my 
    face. And presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the testament, 
    whom you desire, shall come to his temple. Behold he cometh, saith the Lord 
    of hosts.</p>
    <p>* Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2; Luke 1:17; and 7:27.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The first angel or messenger mentioned in the verse alludes to John the 
  Baptist, who preceded Jesus Christ and prepared the way for Him, but the angel 
  of the testament / covenant who comes to His temple is <i>clearly</i> Jesus 
  Christ. So Jesus is described in scripture as the *angel <i>or</i> messenger 
  of the covenant*. That covenant likely being the one made to Adam and Eve in 
  Genesis 3:15, that a redeemer would come to rescue a fallen humanity, or in 
  addition, as we have previously noted, it was Jesus who appeared to Moses on 
  Mount Sinai in the burning bush, and He also gave the Ten Commandments to 
  Moses on tables of stone, which were placed in the container known as the <i>
  ark of the covenant</i>.</p>
  <p>Therefore, in Malachi <i>both</i> John the Baptist and Jesus Christ are 
  referred to as angels, or messengers, in the broadest sense of the meaning of 
  the word. An angel in scripture can simply be a messenger, without meaning the 
  created heavenly winged-being that most associate with the term. This is the 
  key point to be made, <i>Jesus can be referred to as an angel (messenger) 
  without detracting from His deity in any way at all.</i></p>
	<p>The apostle Paul also refers to himself as an angel, meaning messenger:<p class="auto-style1">
	Gal 4:12 (KJV) 12</span>&nbsp;Brethren, I beseech you, be as I <i>am</i>; for I 
	<i>am</i> as ye
	<i>are</i>: ye have not injured me at all.<br>Gal 4:13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel 
	unto you at the first.<br>Gal 4:14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor 
	rejected; but <span class="auto-style2">received me as an angel of God</span>,
	<i>even</i> as Christ Jesus.
	<p>So now, what of Michael the <i>arch</i>angel? Is it so difficult to believe 
  that he may actually be Jesus Christ? Let's look at each instance he is 
  mentioned in the Bible and see-</p>
  <p><strong>ARCHANGEL / MICHAEL TEXT #1</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, 
    with the voice of the *archangel*, and with the trump of God: and the dead 
    in Christ shall rise first:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who raises the dead with His voice? Not a created angel, indeed not even a 
  created archangel. The shout is given with the voice of the *archangel*, the 
  LORD Jesus Christ Himself:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 5:26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the 
    Son to have life in himself;<br>
    John 5:27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he 
    is the Son of man.<br>
    John 5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that 
    are in the graves shall hear his voice,<br>
    John 5:29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the 
    resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of 
    damnation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is the voice of Jesus Christ (the Son of man) that raises the dead. Just 
  as 1 Th 4:16 says, the Lord Jesus shall descend from heaven and shout with the 
  voice of the Archangel, because He <em>is</em> the Archangel. With that shout, 
  the righteous dead will be raised from their graves!</p>
  <p><strong>ARCHANGEL / MICHAEL TEXT #2</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Jude 1:9 Yet *Michael the archangel*, when contending with the devil he 
    disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing 
    accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This verse is a virtual duplicate of another Old Testament event-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Zec 3:1 And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the 
    *angel of the LORD*, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.<br>
    Zec 3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even 
    the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked 
    out of the fire?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In both Jude 9 and Zech 3:1-2 it is Jesus, the *angel of the LORD* who is 
  also *Michael the archangel*, contending with Satan for both Moses and Joshua.</p>
  <p><strong>ARCHANGEL / MICHAEL TEXT #3</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and 
    twenty days: but, lo, *Michael*, one of the chief princes, came to help me; 
    and I remained there with the kings of Persia</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The prince of the kingdom of Persia is a reference to Satan, and Michael 
  refers again to Jesus. It is the created angel Gabriel that is speaking with 
  Daniel (See Dan 8:16, 9:21). The reference to Michael as one of the chief 
  princes probably alludes to the Trinity, with Jesus being one part of the 
  triune Godhead.</p>
  <p><strong>ARCHANGEL / MICHAEL TEXT #4</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 10:21 But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of 
    truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael 
    your prince.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Gabriel says that only he and Michael know certain truths which Gabriel 
  will reveal to Daniel. Who could this Michael be but Jesus, God Himself, 
  giving Gabriel the truths to reveal to Daniel?</p>
  <p><strong>ARCHANGEL / MICHAEL TEXT #5</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which 
    standeth for the children of thy people:
	  and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a 
	  nation <i>even</i> to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be 
	  delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. <br>Dan 12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, 
	  some to everlasting life, and some to shame <i>and</i> everlasting 
	  contempt.</blockquote>
  <p>Michael standing up is a reference to the second coming of Jesus at the end 
  of time when He delivers His people, those listed in the Lamb's book of life, 
  to include resurrecting those that sleep in the dust to everlasting life.</p>
  <p>Some might propose that, in these three preceding texts from Daniel, the 
  description of Michael as a mere prince is inappropriate for Jesus, so it <em>
  must </em>be speaking of a created angel. Note the following verses: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Isa 9:6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the 
    government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called 
    Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of 
    Peace.</p>
    <p>Dan 9:25 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the 
    commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince 
    shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be 
    built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</p>
    <p>Acts 3:14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer 
    to be granted unto you;<br>
    Acts 3:15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; 
    whereof we are witnesses.</p>
    <p>Acts 5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged 
    on a tree.<br>
    Acts 5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a 
    Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p>
    <p>Rev 1:5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first 
    begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him 
    that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>ARCHANGEL / MICHAEL TEXT #6</strong> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought 
    against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Who leads the angelic host of heaven, who is their captain?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Josh 5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted 
    up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with 
    his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, 
    Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?<br>
    Josh 5:14 And he said, Nay; but as *captain of the host* of the LORD am I 
    now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and 
    said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?<br>
    Josh 5:15 And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy 
    shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And 
    Joshua did so.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that Joshua worshipped the *captain of the Host*? If this were a 
  mere angel, then the angel would have protested Joshua worshipping him, just 
  as the angel protested John the Revelator worshipping him (Rev 22:8-9). So 
  Joshua met with God (Jesus Christ) the *captain of the Host*. That is why he 
  stood on holy ground and was asked to remove his shoes (just like Moses was 
  asked in Exo 3:5 and Acts 7:33). Therefore, in Rev 12:7 you have Satan and his 
  angels, and Jesus (Michael, the *captain of the Host*) and His angels - this 
  was the war that began in heaven and continues today.</p>
  <p>And what does the name Michael mean? It means *who (is) like God?* A very 
  good question indeed - who is like Jesus?</p>
  <p>As this study shows, according to scriptures, Jesus is the angel of the 
  LORD, the angel of God, the angel of the covenant, the Archangel Michael, who 
  appeared time and again in the Old Testament to speak directly to His people. 
  Michael is just another title for the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who is God in 
  the flesh, the principle messenger of the gospel (archangel) to humanity, but 
  He is <i>not</i> a created being.</p>

    <p>2. Wherefore, as I

  who is God and Lord of all, who also said to Moses, &quot;I AM THAT I AM. And thus

  and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, who makes those that believe in His name

  believed Me; for he wrote of Me;&quot; [saying this,] no doubt, because the Son of

  <p>ST. CLEMENT OF 
  ALEXANDRIA also says it was the Saviour who spoke from the burning bush:<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The Saviour has many tones of voice, and many methods for the salvation of 
  men; by threatening He admonishes, by upbraiding He converts, by bewailing He 
  pities, by the voice of song He cheers. He spake by the burning bush, for the 
  men of that day needed signs and wonders.&quot;<br>

  </ul>
  <p>And all the Jews even now teach that the nameless God spake to Moses; 
  whence the Spirit of prophecy, accusing them by Isaiah the prophet mentioned 
  above, said &quot;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but 
  Israel doth not know Me, and My people do not understand.&quot;<sup><a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/footnote/fn39.htm#P3916_737967">131</a></sup> 
  And Jesus the Christ, because the Jews knew not what the Father was, and what 
  the Son, in like manner accused them; and Himself said, &quot;No one knoweth the 
  Father, but the Son; nor the Son, but the Father, and they to whom the Son 
  revealeth Him.&quot;<sup><a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/footnote/fn39.htm#P3917_738230">132</a></sup> 
  Now the Word of God is His Son, as we have before said. And He is called Angel 
  and Apostle; for He declares whatever we ought to know, and is sent forth to 
  declare whatever is revealed; as our Lord Himself says, &quot;He that heareth Me, 
  heareth Him that sent Me.&quot;<sup><a href="http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/footnote/fn39.htm#P3918_738511">133</a></sup> 
  From the writings of Moses also this will be manifest; for thus it is written 
  in them, &quot;And the Angel of God spake to Moses, in a flame of fire out of the 
  bush, and said, I am that I am, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God 
  of Jacob, the God of thy fathers; go down into Egypt, and bring forth My

  And if you wish to learn what follows, you can do so from the same writings; 
  for it is impossible to relate the whole here. But so much is written for the 
  sake of proving that Jesus the Christ is the Son of God and His Apostle, being 
  of old the Word, and appearing sometimes in the form of fire, and sometimes in 
  the likeness of angels; but now, by the will of God, having become man for the 
  human race, He endured all the sufferings which the devils instigated the 
  senseless Jews to inflict upon Him; who, though they have it expressly 
  affirmed in the writings of Moses, &quot;And the angel of God spake to Moses in a 
  flame of fire in a bush, and said, I am that I am, the God of Abraham, and the 
  God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,&quot; yet maintain that He who said this was 
  the Father and Creator of the universe.</p>

    <br>
    As an instance of how convinced some of the Fathers were in holding the 
    opposite view, we may note Theodoret's words (In Exod.): &quot;The whole passage 
    (Exodus 3) shows that it was God who appeared to him. But (Moses) called Him 
    an angel in order to let us know that it was not God the Father whom he saw 
    -- for whose angel could the Father be? -- but the Only-begotten Son, the 
    Angel of great Counsel&quot; (cf. Eusebius, Hist. Eccles., I, ii, 7; St. Irenaeus, 
    Haer., iii, 6).<br>

    ... You will perceive also from the same words that this was no other than 
    he [Jesus] who talked with Moses. For the Scripture says in the same words 
    and with reference to the same one, &quot;When the Lord saw that he drew near to 
    see, the Lord called to him out of the bush and said, Moses, Moses. And he 
    said, What is it? And he said, Draw not nigh hither; loose thy shoe from off

    <p align="center">CHAP. IX. -- OF THE PROPHECIES OF THE BIRTH AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF CHRIST</p>
    <p>... For He who ever spake to Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was 
    always <i>seen</i>.<sup>169</sup> For God the Father none ever saw, and 
    lived.<sup>170</sup> And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God 
    Himself spake to Moses, and said to the people, &quot;Behold, I send mine angel 
    before thy&quot; - that is, the people's - &quot;face, to guard thee on the march, and to 
    introduce thee into the land which I have prepared thee: attend to him, and 
    be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped<sup>171</sup> thy notice, 
    since my name is upon him.&quot;<sup>172</sup> For Joshua was to introduce the 
    people into the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an &quot;angel,&quot; on 
    account of the magnitude of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which 
    mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun did, and you yourselves read), and on 
    account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit) the divine will; just 
    as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the 
    forerunner of Christ, John, a future &quot;angel,&quot; through the prophet: &quot;Behold, 
    I send mine angel before Thy&quot; - that is, Christ's - &quot;face, who shall prepare Thy 
    way before Thee.&quot;<sup>173</sup> Nor is it a novel practice to the Holy 
    Spirit to call those &quot;angels&quot; whom God has appointed as ministers of His 
    power. For the same John is called not merely an &quot;angel&quot; of Christ, but 
    withal a &quot;lamp&quot; shining before Christ: for David predicts, &quot;I have prepared 
    the lamp for my Christ;&quot;<sup>174</sup> and him Christ Himself, coming &quot;to 
    fulfil the prophets,&quot;<sup>175</sup> called so to the Jews. &quot;He was,&quot; He 
    says, &quot;the burning and shining lamp;&quot;<sup>176</sup> as being he who not 
    merely &quot;prepared His ways in the desert,&quot;<sup>177</sup> but withal, by 
    pointing out &quot;the Lamb of God,&quot;<sup>178</sup> illumined the minds of men by 
    his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb whom Moses was 
    wont to announce as destined to suffer. Thus, too, (was the son of Nun 
    called) Joshua, on account of the future mystery<sup>179</sup> of his name: 
    for that name (He who spake with Moses) confirmed as His own which Himself 
    had conferred on him, because He had bidden him thenceforth be called, not 
    &quot;angel&quot; nor &quot;Oshea,&quot; but &quot;Joshua.&quot; Thus, therefore, each name is appropriate 
    to the Christ of God-that He should be called Jesus as well (as Christ).</p>
