  <blockquote>
  <p>... &quot;if one considers the importance that Saturday has in the Old Testament 
  tradition, based on the account of the creation and on the Decalogue, it is 
  evident that only an event of overwhelming force could cause giving up 
  Saturday and replacing it by the first day of the week.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;For me, the celebration of the Lord's Day, which has distinguished the 
  Christian community from the beginning, is one of the strongest proofs that 
  something extraordinary happened on that day: the discovery of the empty 
  sepulcher and the encounter with the risen Lord.&quot;</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So it would seem, that the Pope is telling us 
  what he anticipates will be required to impose Sunday on the faithful Sabbath 
  keeping remnant people.</font></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>In the very time in which we live, the Lord has called His people and has 
  given them a message to bear. He has called them to expose the wickedness of 
  the man of sin who has made the Sunday law a <span class="highlight">
  distinctive</span> <span class="highlight">power</span>, who has thought to 
  change times and laws, and to oppress the people of God who stand firmly to 
  honor Him by keeping the only true Sabbath, the Sabbath of creation, as holy 
  unto the Lord. He has called them to bear the sign of God, to exalt the Lord 
  in keeping holy His law; for it is a transcript of His character. No part of 
  the law of God and their covenant obligation to keep that law holy is to lose 
  its binding claims upon all the world. Those who have had the light upon 
  keeping the law of Jehovah are to stand firmly in the faith, and to make that 
  light shine forth in clear, distinct rays. <span class="reference">{18MR 33.1}</span></p>
