  The Last Pope and Satan's Impersonation of Christ Predicted?</a></b></p>
    <p>In Daniel and Revelation there is a symbolic beast described as having 10 
    horns, or 7 heads and 10 horns, which may or may not be wearing crowns, no 
    two descriptions being identical. Here are the verses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 7:7 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, 
    dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: 
    it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of 
    it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had 
    ten horns.</p>
    <p>Rev 12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great 
    red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his 
    heads.</p>
    <p>Rev 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up 
    out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten 
    crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</p>
    <p>Rev 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I 
    saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, 
    having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><b>DANIEL 7</b></u></p>
  <p>We are told what the 4 beasts in Daniel's vision are:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Dan 7:17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall 
  arise out of the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The first beast, the Lion, corresponds to the head of gold in Daniel 2, and 
  is the empire of Babylon.</p>
  <p>The second beast, the Bear, corresponds to the chest of silver in Daniel 2, 
  and the Ram in Daniel 8, and is the empire of Medo-Persia.</p>
  <p>The third beast, the Leopard, corresponds to the belly of brass in Daniel 
  2, and the He-Goat in Daniel 8, is the empire of Greece.</p>
  <p>The fourth beast, terrible and strong, corresponds to the legs of iron in 
  Daniel 2, the empire of pagan Rome. This fourth beast is described as having 
  10 horns, which corresponds to the ten toes in Daniel 2, and this symbol is 
  defined for us:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Dan 7:24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall 
  arise:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This tells us that when the forth great kingdom fell, the result would be 
  its division into smaller kingdoms. The came to pass in 476 A.D. with the fall 
  and division of pagan Rome. So why in Daniel 7 are there no crowns on the 10 
  horns of Daniel 7? What do crowns mean when they are present? The key is that 
  crowns on horns or heads indicate that the kings/kingdoms represented <i>
  are in the past </i>with respect to the timeframe of the vision, their reigns 
  having been fully completed. In the case 
  of Daniel 7, the timeframe of the vision is during the existence of Babylon, 
  meaning the second through the fourth beasts/kingdoms, and the 10 horns, were 
  still in the future, so there are no crowns on the 10 horns of Daniel 7.</p>
  <p><u><b>REVELATION 13</b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Rev 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out 
  of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, 
  and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.<br>
  Rev 13:2 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were 
  as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon 
  gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.<br>
  Rev 13:3 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his 
  deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the same beasts from Daniel 7 are seen, but they are presented in
  <i>reverse</i> order, <i>and now those ten horns wear crowns</i>! This means that the 
  timeframe or perspective of the vision is <i>after</i> the fall and division 
  of pagan Rome, and after the rise of&nbsp; the papacy (the composite beast 
  from the sea). The ten horns are all in the past, so they wear crowns. </p>
  <p>O.K., so John in Revelation 13 is seeing events from a perspective of after 
  476 A.D., but can we narrow this down any more? Yes. Note that John sees a 
  second beast rise up:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Rev 13:11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had 
  two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This second lamb-like beast (the U.S.) has <i>no</i> crowns on its horns because it is <i>
  not</i> in the past, it still exists! The timeframe of Revelation 13 is also
  <i>after</i> the healing of the wound to one of the heads (v. 3). Pope John 
  Paul II was wounded, almost to death in 1982, and he is the sixth head since 
  1929. </p>
  <p>Note also that the first beast, the beast from the sea is described as 
  having 7 heads, but they have no crowns yet. This is because the exact 
  timeframe of Revelation 13 is <i>during the reign of the 7th head</i> since 
  1929, Pope Benedict 
  XVI, when the second lamb-like beast from the land (the U.S.) does the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Rev 13:12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, 
  and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, 
  whose deadly wound was healed.<br>
  Rev 13:13 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from 
  heaven on the earth in the sight of men,<br>
  Rev 13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those 
  miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them 
  that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which 
  had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those events are in our very near future.</p>
  <p><u><b>REVELATION 17</b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I 
    saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, 
    having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here the beast with 7 heads and 10 horns has no crowns at all! Consider 
  these verses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are 
    seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.<br>
    Rev 17:10 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the 
    other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.<br>
    Rev 17:11 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is 
    of the seven, and goeth into perdition.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This gives us the precise timeframe of Revelation 17, during the reign of 
  the 6th head since 1929, Pope John Paul II. Since not all the 7 heads have not 
  fully completed their reigns yet, there are no crowns on the 7 heads.</p>
  <p>Now regarding the 10 horns:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:12 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have 
    received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the 
    beast.</p>
    <p>Rev 17:16 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall 
    hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her 
    flesh, and burn her with fire.<br>
    Rev 17:17 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, 
    and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be 
    fulfilled.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These 10 horns, from the timeframe perspective of Revelation 17, do not 
  exist yet. They are <i>not</i> the same exact 10 horns that resulted from the 
  fall and division of pagan Rome. These 10 horns only exist at the very end of time, 
  for one prophetic hour (about two weeks) just 
  prior to the second coming, and they destroy the harlot church with fire. </p>
  <p><u><b>REVELATION 12</b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great 
    red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his 
    heads.</p>
    <p>Rev 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the 
    Devil, and Satan, ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>First of all, observe that we are plainly told that the beast with 7 heads 
  and 10 horns is Satan. Therefore, the beast with 7 heads and 10 horns in 
  Revelation 13 and 17 also involve Satan. Now, notice the 7 heads in Revelation 
  12 wear crowns! This is because the reign of the 7 heads has concluded, and is 
  in the past, but the 10 horns have no crowns (these are the same 10 horns as 
  in Revelation 17) since they are yet future. The timeframe for Revelation 12 is <i>after</i> the reign 
  of the 7 heads, and <i>during</i> the reign of the 8th, who is &quot;of the seven&quot;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 17:11 ... even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into 
    perdition.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The timeframe for Revelation 12 is <i>during</i> the reign of the eighth, 
  Satan, when he masquerades as Christ on earth:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he 
    persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.<br>
    Rev 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she 
    might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a 
    time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.<br>
    Rev 12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the 
    woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.<br>
    Rev 12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, 
    and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<br>
    Rev 12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with 
    the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the 
    testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left"><u><b>CONCLUSION</b></u></p>
  <p>So, after the <u>short</u> reign of Pope Benedict XVI (the 7th head), Satan will 
  masquerade as the returned Christ, and persecute the true commandment keeping 
  church of God. <u>We are about to see this happen</u>. How long will Satan have for this? Verse 14 tells us: &quot;a time, 
  and times, and half a time&quot;. A time is one year, so &quot;a time, and times, and 
  half a time&quot; is 3 1/2 years. That is the same length of time as Jesus' 
  ministry from His baptism to His ascension. </p>
