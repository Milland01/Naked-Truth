      <tr>
        <td width="100%">... The weaknesses of this interpretation are profound, as I have argued 
  before:<p>1. The VFD view selects only one (relatively uncommon) title of the pope to 
  fulfill a prophecy of the &quot;number of the beast.&quot; With so many other titles, 
  nearly all of them far more common and invested with an more official status, 
  why would one select this one? Honestly, why this one? There is one reason: 
  this title, unlike the others, can be manipulated to fulfill the prophecy. As 
  I have stated in one of my essays: &quot;The VFD view effectively argued from 
  convenience: seeking what worked to satisfy the 666 prophecy, no matter how 
  tenuous the connections.&quot;</p>
  <p>2. Just as embarrassing, the VFD view selects a Latin title which must be 
  interpreted using a system of Roman numerals to fulfill the specifications of 
  a gammatria prophecy written in Greek for a Greek-speaking audience. This fact 
  alone makes the entire enterprise appear far too suspect and tenuous. How 
  would one know to look for a title in the Latin language, and interpret it 
  according to a Latin gammatrial system? Again: the VFD grasps unto what is 
  possible, however stretched. (Note: Michael claims this is legitimate insofar 
  as the papacy issues its documents in Latin and &quot;obviously&quot; is the beast. I am 
  less than impressed.)</p>
  <p>3. Finally, the view never connects VFD (as &quot;the number of the beast&quot;) to 
  the &quot;mark of the beast,&quot; despite the fact that the two are equivocal according 
  to the prophecy (13:17).</p>

  <p>1. Vicarius Filii Dei has a long history of use in the Roman Catholic 
  Church, which is now quite well documented, to include use by Paul VI as 
  recently as 40 years ago. However, association of Revelation 13:18 to the 
  papacy via this title proves nothing in and of itself. It seems completely 
  arbitrary to anyone not familiar with the prophecies that pinpoint the Roman 
  Catholic Church. You have to identify the little horn, the man of sin, the 
  beast from the sea, and the harlot, also known as Mystery Babylon, first, <i>
  before</i> you look for an application of 666. Simply trying to pin 666 on any 
  individual, without the relevant prophecies being understood, is really quite 
  futile. By the way, no &quot;manipulation&quot;, as Hugo put it, of VFD is necessary to 
  arrive at 666, it is a simple straight-forward calculation. </p>
  <p>2. What I actually said to Hugo was:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&quot;The Roman Catholic Church is easily identified as the sole 
    candidate for the Antichrist / Harlot Church based on the many other 
    criteria specified by prophecy, Old and New Testament, and the title appears 
    in official Church documents in Latin. It is irrelevant what language the 
    prophecy was written it.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>3. As to the mark/number of the beast issue, I explained to Hugo in my 
  email: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;You should know full well that number of the beast and the mark of the 
    beast are two different characteristics.&nbsp; The mark of Catholic authority 
    over the law of God is Sunday keeping. The blasphemous name/title that 
    equates to 666 is vicarius filii dei. By the way, it is significant that in 
    Trionfo's <i>Summa,</i> which applies the title to the papacy, also 
    attributes the change from Sabbath to Sunday to the Pope, and that it was in 
    print for <i>hundreds</i> of years.&quot;</p>
