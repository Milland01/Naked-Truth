<blockquote>
  <p align="left">According to the <strong><a
  href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05075b.htm">1913 Catholic Encyclopedia</a></strong>,
  Laurence Vaux's Catechism was the first Reformation era Catholic Catechism in English when
  it was published in 1567. Reprints followed in 1574, 1583, 1599 and 1605. The following is
  from a reprint of the 
  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xh0sAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=A+Catechisme+of+Christian+Doctrine+by+Laurence+Vaux,+BD&amp;cd=1">1583 edition</a>, published by The Chetham Society in 1885. The old
  English spelling has in most cases been updated for the convenience of the reader. </p>

touching the edition of this book.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="6">O</font><em>ften times I have heard many devout Christians
  complain of the scarcity and want of this Catechism, heretofore complied and set forth by
  the reverend good Father L. Vaux: and have heard also many commend the same, at to be a
  book whereof they themselves &amp; others have reaped much commodity.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore I have long before this, purposed to put forth this said
  Catechism: yet for that great volumes are written of the like argument in other languages,
  I deferred the matter, daily expecting some more ample discourse: and such as might serve
  the turns of all as well Learned and unlearned. But when I made some good men privie to
  this my purpose &amp; expectation, it was answered, that for an uncertain commodity to
  lose a certain, such a case were neither wisdom nor piety: for though it might be, that
  some learned man would hereafter enlarge this argument, and put it forth: yet it is
  uncertain when that will be: &amp; when it cometh, it may perhaps not so aptly serve for
  young scholars and the unlearned (To whose use this short and compendious pamphlet was by
  the Author here of first meant and pretended) as this does.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon to satisfy the desire of these good men: and to the intent
  and benefit of this my travail might grow</em></p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 4]</p>
  <p align="left"><em>to Gods glory, and to the furtherance and increasing of the Catholic
  faith and Religion with the advancement of the godly intent of the first Author, I have to
  my charges &amp; pains, newly put forth in print this Catechism with the instructions of
  the laudable Ceremonies lately added thereunto.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finding in other godly books, diverse brief notes of good and godly
  matters in foreign tongue not pertinent to this argument, I have thought good to collect,
  compile, translate and publish the same as an appendix to this book, for a further
  argumentation of profit and commodity to the unlearned: which my travail I desire may be
  accepted of all, as profitable to the readers as they may make it, and with as good a will
  as I offer it.</em></p>

  <p align="center">THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.</p>
  <hr width="15%">
  <p align="left">When I did inwardly consider in my mind a Decree in the seventh Canon made
  at the Second General Council held at the Lateran wherein Schoolmasters are straitly
  charged, upon Sundays and Holy-days to instruct and teach their Scholars Christian
  doctrine, appertaining to Religion and good manners, as the Articles of faith, the
  Commandments of God, &amp; such like: And also to exhort and compel their Scholars to be
  present in the Church with a reverent devotion, in prayer at the times of Mass, Mattins,
  and Evensong, the which Decree I did see diligently observed at Louan, &amp; other places
  in Germany and Italy: These and such like considered, in mine own conscience I did confess
  a great negligence in my self, that I had not done my duty heretofore in bringing up my
  scholars. (Concil. Latera. 2)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these things upon a time I had talk with a grave godly man, who
  sometime did exercise an honorable room in England, and much pitied the lack of
  instruction of youth, and the ignorance that was among the simple people there, and of a
  godly zeal that he had toward the salvation of the souls of the simple of the simple and
  unlearned, he earnestly requested me, to set forth in writing an Instruction, what all
  people ought to believe and do, if they will be saved.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 6]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose request I was willing to satisfy for two causes,
  partly to recompense my negligence, in that I had not done my duty in teaching and
  instructing them that were committed to my charge (taking comfort of the parable in the
  Gospel, that he which entered into the vineyard to labor at eleven o'clock, received his
  penny equally with him that entered into the vineyard early in the morning to work)
  (Matth. 20.) partly to join with the said godly man, in the intent to do good to many, and
  to hurt none: trusting although I come late, that yet this my simple Mite may be received
  with the poor widow's oblation (Mark 12), although I was much afraid to have it put in
  print, lest it should come to the hands of such learned men, as would look for finesse of
  sentence, and eloquence of words, which are lacking in me: my means whereof in the end I
  feared, lest my good will and diligent labor should result in my rebuke and reproach.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus being in a great perplexity, it chanced that I had conference in
  this matter with a learned man, whose judgment I trusted better than mine own, &amp;
  wholly depending upon his counsel, I did forsake mine own fancy &amp; will herein. And
  being animated and encouraged by my said learned friend to take the matter in hand: after
  my simple and rude manner, I have compiled this little book for young scholars, and the
  unlearned, beseeching God in my daily prayers (if it be his will and pleasure) so to give
  his grace to the readers hereof, that some goodness may come thereby in the amendment of
  life, to God's</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 7]</p>
  <p align="left">glory, and their souls health and comfort, which is the only purpose and
  intent that moved me to take pains to set forth this little book called A Christian
  Doctrine.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what I have set forth in this little book, the ground and substance
  I have collected &amp; translated out of the Scripture, &amp; general Councils, out of the
  books of D. Petrus de Soto, and D. Canisius, adding here and there some sentences of the
  ancient Fathers, S. Cyprian, Athanasius, Ambrose, Hierome, Damascene, &amp; S. Bernard.
  God send the ears to hear which shall learn it, and them, that need not learn it, because
  they know it, to take it quietly when they read it, knowing that I have made it for the
  simple, and ignorant, and not for the fine fellows, and learned.</p>

  <p align="center">CHAP. I. (<em>Of faith.</em>)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is man?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">M</font>AN is a reasonable creature of God, which God hath
  made marvelously of a body &amp; a soul. As concerning the body, he is mortal like unto
  beasts. But as concerning the soul, he is immortal like unto Angels, made after the
  likeness &amp; image of God, that is to say, with power of knowledge and love, apt to
  receive felicity, &amp; true blessedness, which consists in the clear knowledge and
  fruition of God.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whom do you call a Christian Catholic man?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">H</font>im that has received the Sacrament of Baptism,
  whereby he is made a member of the Catholic Church, &amp; does profess in heart, word, and
  deed, the wholesome doctrine of Jesus Christ &amp; of the Catholic Church, and does not
  consent nor agree to any strange sects, or opinions, that the Catholic Church does disavow
  or condemn.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How, or by what means are you made a Christian?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font> Am made a Christian, first by the special grace of
  God in me, &amp; his mercy: whereby (when I was a servant of the devil &amp; wrath) by
  Baptism he has received me, to be his </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 10]</p>
  <p align="left">child by adoption, when I could neither discern, nor know it by my age.
  And also now by his special inspiration and grace (as firmly I believe) he hath persuaded
  this thing in my mind, and made me certain, that this faith, and doctrine of Religion,
  which I do hold and believe, he has revealed in the Catholic Church, which as been taught
  of Christ, &amp; his Apostles, and their successors to this day. And I am persuaded, that
  same faith &amp; doctrine, only to be true, &amp; that it shall continue to the end of the
  world: but all other sects, false religions, and heresies, which have risen from time to
  time, to be pernicious, hurtful and damnable.<a name="10"></a></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Of what things ought a Christian man first to be instructed and
  taught?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">O</font>f Faith, Hope, &amp; Charity, of the Sacraments,
  and offices of Christian righteousness. For although the doctrine of Christ &amp; his
  Catholic Church be large, &amp; contain all the holy Scripture, with traditions unwritten
  (which we are bound firmly to believe) notwithstanding under these five things especially
  all other things are contained &amp; comprehended, either expressly in words, or
  understanded.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. First, those things which appertain to faith, that we are bound to
  believe, are contained under the Articles of our Creed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Secondly, those things that appertain to hope, and which we should
  desire &amp; hope for, are contained under the petitions of our Pater Noster.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Thirdly, those things that appertain to Charity, are comprehended
  under the ten Commandments of God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Fourthly, Grace, mercy and sanctification is given to us by the holy
  Sacraments.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Fifthly, by the offices of righteousness we are instructed and
  taught to decline from evil and to do good.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 11]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>By what entrance must we come unto God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst we must come unto God by faith: for without
  faith it is impossible to please God (Heb. 11.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is Faith?</em></p>

  conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary, taking flesh &amp; blood of her (by the working
  of the holy Ghost without seed of man) which conception was immediately after the

  consolation and comfort of many Fathers there, and out of that place (called <em>Lymbus
  Patrum</em>) (Matth. 8., Luke 14., Ephe. 4., I Cor. 15.)</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 14]</p>
  <p align="left">he loosed the souls of the blessed Fathers from captivity, and carried

  after his glorious resurrection in the same manhood marvelously ascended into heaven with
  great glory and triumph, carrying with him the souls which he had loosed from captivity,
  and bondage of the devil. And there Christ assumed into heaven, is peaceably in great
  glory &amp; majesty, both judges and disposes all things quietly &amp; peaceably with God
  the Father in everlasting blessedness (which is understanded by the right hand) where his
  seat was prepared from the beginning of the world. (Acts I., Matth. 16., Luke 24., Heb.

  people, first gathered together of Christ &amp; his disciples, continued unto this day in
  a perpetual succession, in one Apostolic faith, living under Christ the head: and in
  earth, under his Vicar, Pastor and chief Bishop. (Aug. ca. 4. cont. epis. fundamen.)</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><em>Why is the Church called one?</em></font></p>

  congregations of the malignant Church, which are divided into sundry schisms, sects, and
  opinions in doctrine, as the Lutherans Church does not agree with the Zuinglians, nor the
  Zuinglians with the Anabaptists &amp;c. Therefore Christ his Church is called one, being
  gathered together in one spirit of Jesus christ. In this Church is confessed and
  worshipped one God, one faith is confessed and taught, one baptism and one uniform order
  of Sacraments are ministered without schism or division, having one Head in earth, God's
  Vicar in the Apostolic See, successor to S. Peter. ( Ephe. 4.)</font></p>

  one to another: so that the true doctrine, principal traditions, general observations and
  customs used in the Church at this day, we are able to show instituted or allowed by the
  Bishops succeeding lineally to the Apostles Peter and Paul, which did sit at Rome, there
  laying a foundation of Christ his Church, and also suffered martyrdom there.</font></p>

  go to everlasting joy both body and soul: and they that have done evil, shall go to
  everlasting pains both body and soul: so that after this life, is an everlasting life,
  either in joy, or pain. <em>This is the Catholic faith, the which except we wholly and

  <p align="left"><font size="3">an infinite goodness, is one in nature and substance, &amp;

  these manner of people are excluded from the Communion of Saints, the participation of
  Sacraments, &amp; sufferages of the Church: which be clean void of a spiritual life, &amp;
  are in bondage of the devil.</font></p>

  Catholic is: They that do profess the faith of Christ, &amp; the whole authority of the
  Church, and steadfastly do hold the doctrine and faith of the Church, which the Doctors
  and Pastors of the Catholic Church do define and teach to be believed, are Catholics. For
  he that will not obey the Church (Christ him self says) let him be taken as a Heathen
  &amp; Publican (Matth. 18). He shall not have God to be his Father, that will not have the
  Church to be his mother. (Cypri.)</font></p>

  from us, and that the love of God be so kindled in our hearts with pureness of life, that
  with all our might and strength we may endeavor our selves, to magnify, extol, &amp;

  <p align="center"><font size="3">OF THE AVE MARIA.<br>
  <em>Whereof came this manner of salutation to the Blessed Virgin Mary?</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font><font size="3">he first part came of the example of
  the Angel Gabriel which with great reverance &amp; humility did salute the virgin Mary,
  being set from God, so show the wonderful incarnation of our saviour christ our redeemer,
  saying: <em>Hail full of grace, our Lord is with thee. </em>The second of the example of
  S. Elizabeth, which being replenished with the holy ghost, did salute her saying: <em>Blessed
  art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. </em>Now the continuance of
  this manner, of the salutation, comes of the use &amp; custom of the catholic church,
  being taught by the holy ghost, this Angelical Salutation, to be a very necessary prayer
  of laud &amp; praise, to be often said, &amp; to be joined to our Pater noster.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><em>What fruit or profit does this Salutation bring us?</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font><font size="3">t does revive and stir up in us, the
  gracious and healthful memory of the holy Virgin Mary &amp; our Lords Incarnation. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">[pg. 23]</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">And furthermore it does admonish us, &amp; put us in
  remembrance, that we may seek to get the gracious favour of the Virgin to make
  intercession for us to God.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><em>What may we believe of this Salutation?</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font><font size="3">he excellent gifts &amp; praises of
  the incomparable Virgin: that she was replenished, and fulfilled with the gifts of God,
  and the most singular virtues: that she was a Virgin and a Mother: that she was blessed
  among all women of all times: that she was Mother of the King of all Kings, mother of
  Christ our Lord God. Also that she was the procurer of grace, and mother of life, which is
  Christ himself.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="3"><em>Why is the Ave Maria used so often to be said for a
  prayer, seeing there is no petition in it?</em></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">W</font><font size="3">ho so ever has any suite, or request
  that he would gladly obtain of a Prince, Magistrate, or his Superior: he will use often
  words that will please and delight the mind of him that his suite is to, that thereby his
  mind may be moved with affection, and made attentive to hear the Suiter, and grant all his
  requests. So all Christian people are suiters to God, and ought to make suite &amp;
  request for mercy, grace, and godly help, to attain and come to eternal glory. And for
  because our blessed Lady was preelected &amp; chosen of God before all other creatures, to
  be the mother of Christ took his manhood, wherewith he redeemed us: therefore it is
  expedient, to desire the said Mother of God to pray for us, that by her intercession we
  may the better obtain our suite of God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No words can be found in the holy Scripture of more efficacy and
  strength, to move the holy Trinity mercifully to hear our suite, &amp; grant our request,
  then the Angelical Salutation.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">[pg. 24]</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First what words can more acceptable to
  God the Father, then these words, that he himself was the Author of, &amp; (as one would
  say) edited in heaven, and sent them down into earth by his mighty Archangel Gabriel, when
  he had decreed mans redemption &amp; salutation.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What words can be more pleasant to god the Son, the second person of
  the Trinity, then the words of the Angel, whereby his blessed incarnation is most
  specially remembered: that he being god, was also mad man perfectly: taking his manhood of
  the most pure blood of the blessed Virgin Mary, and was the blessed fruit of her womb:
  which fruit that the blessed Virgin brought forth, is really present in the blessed
  Sacrament of the Altar, to feed and nourish the worthy receivers, and to bring everlasting
  life to them that receive worthily. And also to be as a medicine, to expel the poison of
  the fruit that Eve first tasted of, which brought death and condemnation to all mankind.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What words can more please god the Holy Ghost, the third Person in
  Trinity, then these words that the Angel spake to the blessed Virgin Mary: by the which he
  did work the miraculous Incarnation of our Saviour in the Virgins womb? So the will of the
  holy Trinity was wrought by the Salutation of the Angel, to great joy of Angels, &amp; to
  the unspeakable comfort of mankind: what words can be more joyful to the blessed virgin
  Mary then to hear these words that the Angel saluted her with, at the conception of our
  Saviour Christ in her womb: when Eva was turned into Ave, declaring her to be innocent,
  without spot of sin, so full of grace, as never any earthly creature was: in such sort and
  manner to have our Lord God with her, as never any creature had: to have such blessedness,
  as never any woman had. Being a pure Virgin and mother, without grief or pain, </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3">[pg. 25]</font></p>

<p align="center">CHAP. 3. (<em>Of Charity</em>)<br>
<em>Si vis ad vit ingredi, serus mandata.<br>
</em>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments.</p>

<p align="center">OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT.<br>
<em>What is Charity?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">C</font>harity is a virtue given from God, by the keeping
  whereof (as Christ said) we shall possess everlasting life in the kingdom of heaven.
  (Matth. 22., Luke 10, Matth. 19.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many Commandments of God be there?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>en whereof the first Commandment is: Thou shalt
  have none other Gods but one: God the Father, god the Son, and God the holy Ghost, three
  Persons, and one God. Thou shalt worship thy Lord God and only serve him.&nbsp; (Exo. 20.,
  Matth. 4.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What meaneth this Commandment?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t does prohibit and condemn all idolatry and
  worshipping of false Gods, art magic, divination, superstitions observations, &amp; all
  wicked worshipping. And upon the contrary part it requires, that we believe in God and
  worship him. (Exo. 23., Deu. 18.)</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 26]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many manner of honours and worship be there?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hree, which be called <em>Latria, Hyperdulia,</em>
  and <em>Dulia.</em></p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the honour and worship called Latria?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">L</font><em>atria </em>is a Service, Adoration, honour
  &amp; worship, that must be given only to God being the beginning &amp; end of every
  creature. By this honour and worship called <em>Latria</em>: we must honour, worship &amp;
  reverence the blessed Trinity, and Christ incarnate the second Person in Trinity.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the honour, worship, and reverence called Hyperdulia?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">H</font><em>yperdulia</em>, is a reverence, worship, &amp;
  honour, due unto no other, but to such as be most joined unto God: as our most blessed
  Lady mother of God of whom Christ took his manhood.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the honour, worship, and reverence, that is called Dulia?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">D</font>ulia, is a reverence, worship, and honour
  appertaining to reverend persons both in heaven and in earth. By this honour called <em>Dulia</em>,
  we worship and honour the Angels and Saints in heaven. But we do not honour &amp; worship
  Saints, as putting more confidence and trust in them, then in God, nor with such honor as
  is due to God. For we honour them as the friends of God, being his Children and heirs by
  grace, and our Advocates and Intercessors with God the giver of all honor. In earth we
  reverence their Relics and Images but the honour is referred to the Saints themselves.
  Also with this honor of Dulia we honour our Parents, Superiors, &amp; all reverend
  persons. (Damas. lib. 4. ca. 16.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How is God due honour &amp; service given him?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n our hearts by faith, hope and charity. In our
  bodies by outward gesture and acts as Sacrifice and fasting, &amp;c.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 27]</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n believing the xii. Articles of our Creed, both
  expressed in words, and understanded as holy Church does believe and teach: and in having
  an inward devotion of mind toward God &amp; his Saints for his sake.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How must we honour God by Hope?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">W</font>e must have a steadfast trust in god, that of his
  mercy &amp; grace (our good works answering there unto) he will reward us with everlasting
  joy in heaven.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How must we honour God by Charity?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">W</font>e must love God with all our hearts so firmly, that
  neither for fear nor flattery, prosperity, nor adversity we be carried away from God.
  (Charity. Matth. 22.) And that the love of no creature remain in our hearts, but for God
  and godliness. With all our souls we must love god so faithfully, that we had rather our
  souls should be severed from our bodies, then from god. This love makes all things light
  and easy: this love caused the glorious Martyrs to suffer all kind of torments, both
  patiently and gladly for the fervent love of God. This ardent love unto God, caused the
  blessed Fathers in wilderness to take great pains and penance upon them, in fasting, and
  praying, weeping and mourning. For their meat and drink they used dry bread and cold
  water, herbs, roots, and barks of trees, for their clothing, heare and sack, the cold
  earth for a bed: a hard stone for a pillow: and were ready to suffer any cruel death for
  Christs sake: their hearts were so kindled with a burning Charity towards God.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><em>Who be they, that break the first commandment of God by Infidelity?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font>ll heretics, idolaters, Turks and Jews, and all
  they that do not profess the catholic faith both in heart, word and deed, that our
  godfathers and godmothers promised for us in Baptism: And all they that neglect to learn
  the Articles of our faith, and the Commandments of god. For we ought to learn the said
  Articles of our faith &amp; ten Commandments, before we receive the blessed Sacrament of
  the Altar.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who be they that break the first commandment, by doubting in Faith?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that do not steadfastly believe, but doubt
  whether there be a Paradise, a hell, and a Purgatory. Also they that do not steadfastly
  believe the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, and other Sacraments of the Catholic Church.
  For he that doubts in faith, mistrusts the certainty of Gods word.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who be they that break this Commandment, by presumptuous searching
  of Faith?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that presumptuously search the Articles of
  Faith or doubting, dispute of Faith and Verity. And they that will believe nothing
  concerning Faith, but that with can be tried and shown by reason: for faith has no merit
  where mans reason gives experiment. No man can try our his faith by reason. (3. Grego.)</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 29]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaketh the first Commandment by denying of Faith?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that will not confess the Catholic faith with
  their mouths, although they believe it in their hearts for a Christian man ought to be of
  such constancy, that he should rather suffer his life to be taken from him, then his
  faith. And S. Paul says: <em>we believe in heart to righteousness, and confess in mouth to
  salvation</em>. (Rom. 10)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaketh the first commandment of God by tempting of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that require of God, or of his Saints,
  miracles: &amp; seek to be helped of God by miracle where they may be helped by other
  means. And they that for poverty, sickness, or adversity, do murmur &amp; grudge, that God
  will not grant them their desire, when peradventure they desire against their souls
  health. For many times god does not give us that, which we desire: to the intent he have
  give us that which is is better for us.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaketh the first Commandment of God by unreverence of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that do not give due reverence to God, and his
  Saints, or to their Relics and Images. Secondly, they that unworthily receive the blessed
  Sacrament of the Altar. Thirdly, they that unreverently behave themselves before the
  blessed Sacrament. Fourthly, they that unreverently behave themselves in the Church, or
  other places dedicated to gods service: as they that will not pray with their mouths,
  kneel upon their knees, knock upon their breasts, holy up their hands and lift up their
  eyes when ordered requires, and necessity or reason dispenses not.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaketh the first Commandment by art Magic?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that of purpose tell destinies by taking of
  lots, or verses in the scriptures, Enchanters, witches, Sorcerers, </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 30]</p>
  <p align="left">interpreters of dreams, &amp; such like prohibited by the law of God: and
  all they that advisedly use their help to recover health, or to get a thing that is lost. </p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is the first Commandment broken, concerning hope?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hree manner of ways: By desperation, by presumption
  of gods mercy, and presumption of our good works.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaks the first Commandment by desperation?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst, they that by temptation of the Devil,
  pusilanimitie, or other infirmity destroy themselves upon mistrust of gods mercy. Secondly
  they that do think their sins so great, that God either can not, or will not forgive their
  sins. Thirdly, they that heap sin upon sin and will not go about to get remission of their
  sins. All such break this Commandment.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaks the first Commandment by presumption of Gods mercy?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst, they that continue in sin still, trusting to
  have mercy without Penance, and everlasting life without good works: &amp; will say, God
  has created them, and redeemed them, and therefore he must needs save them. Secondly, they
  that trust only by Christ's Passion, or by only faith to be saved. Thirdly they that
  continue in sin still, trusting in the hour of death to ask mercy and to have it: which is
  a presumption without all discretion. For when the heart is pinched with pangs of death,
  the body vexed with sickness, the mind tossed with the perplexity of hell-fire, and both
  body and soul environed &amp; compassed about with horrible swarms of Devils: the commonly
  grace &amp; memory fails to ask mercy. And then it fares (as </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 31]</p>
  <p align="left">Scripture says) <em>he that loves danger, shall perish in it (Eccle. 3). </em>For
  he that will not seek for mercy when he may, often lacks it when he would have it. All
  such breaks the Commandment of God by presumption of gods mercy.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaks the first Commandment by presumption of good works?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font>ll they that think their merits so great, that they
  ought to have no adversity in this life, and they shall possess heaven only by their
  merits. And they that think they can merit of themselves, without the continual grace of
  god. Such break the Commandment of God by presumption of good works.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is the first Commandment broken, concerning Charity?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hree manner of ways, by love of worldly things, by
  worldly fear, and by servile fear.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaks the first commandment by love of worldly things?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst of all, they that love wife, child, master,
  friend, or themselves more than god. Secondly, they that for worldly gains, preferment, or
  carnal pleasure neglect their duty to god. Thirdly they that be more careful for worldly
  things, then for heavenly things, &amp; would still remain in the world if they might. For
  the love of god &amp; the world can not dwell together in one heart. Nor one heart can
  serve God &amp; Mammon. All such break the Commandment of God.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaks the first commandment by worldly fear?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst of all they, that for fear of Princes, Lords,
  Magistrates or Masters, do not obey the Commandment of God.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 32]</p>
  <p align="left">Secondly, they that fear more the displeasure of any man, than of god.
  Thirdly they that for fear to be talked of or scorned, withdraw themselves from Divine
  service, or worshipping of God, or of his Saints. Such break this commandment of God.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who breaks the first Commandment by servile fear?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font>ll they that keep the Commandments of god only for
  fear of punishment in hell-fire, &amp; not for the love of god: all such break this
  Commandment of god.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many causes be there that move us to love God above all things?</em></p>
  <p align="left">Seven especially.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Gods chief goodness.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 He loved us first.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 He is our Father.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 He has redeemed us.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 He provides continually for us.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 He is present unto us in the Blessed Sacrament.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 He promised to us a reward, that eye never saw, that ear never heard,
  that heart never thought.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE SECOND COMMANDMENT.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the second Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt not take the name of god in vain.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What means this Commandment?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t does forbid and condemn the abusing and
  unreverent taking of the name of God, and his Saints, or any other creature: which is
  committed of perjurers, and blasphemers. No man may swear an oath without a great cause,
  and that must be before a </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 33]</p>
  <p align="left">Judge in verity, in justice, and judgment: that is, truly, uprightly, and
  advisedly. Otherwise all our talk ought to be, yea, and nay. </p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is the name of God taken in vain?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>ive manner of ways: By perjury, blasphemy, unlawful
  vows, breaking of lawful vows, and by unadvised taking of the name of God and his Saints.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is God offended by Perjury?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">S</font>even manner of ways. First by falsity, in calling
  God or his Saints to witness, affirming with an oath that, which is false: or that, which
  we think to be false.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly by doubtfulness, affirming with an oath that, which we be
  doubt of, although it prove true afterward.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, if we promise with an oath to another that, which we intend
  not to perform.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, if by craft or subtlety of words in an oath we go about to
  deceive the hearers understanding.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, if we swear to do a naughty act or deed, which oath is not to
  be kept.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, if we swear to omit a good deed, or work of Charity, which
  oath is not to be kept.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventhly, if of purpose we compel any man to perjury.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is God offended by blasphemy?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">S</font>even manner of ways: First if we swear by false
  Gods. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, if we attribute unto God that, which does not agree to him:
  as to say, God is not righteous or merciful.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, if we deny anything, that agrees to God: as to deny God to
  take care of mortal things.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, if we attribute unto a creature that, which only </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 34]</p>
  <p align="left">agrees to God: as if we attribute to the devil and fortune the power and
  dominion of all things.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, if we attribute members to God, as concerning his divinity.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, if we curse God or his Saints, and will say: God is not
  righteous, if we may not have our own will. For as light is odious to sore eyes, and good
  meat unsavory to the sick: so God his mercy displeases evil &amp; wicked people.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventhly, if we do injury to God or to his Saints.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is God offended by unlawful vows?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>our manner of ways. First if we make a vow, to do
  an evil deed: as to kill a man, or to maim him.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, if we make a vow against a godly purpose: as not to enter
  into religion, or not to give alms.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, if we vow a lawful vow for an evil intent, that we have have
  our unlawful purpose, so to make God author of evil.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, if we make a vow that is foolish, indiscrete, or
  unreasonable. And if we do not perform our lawful vow in due time, we break Gods
  commandment: yet some vows for a reasonable cause may be changed or dispensed with, by
  them that have authority to dispense.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, we may break the second commandment of God by unadvisedly taking
  of the name of God: as if without need or compulsion we swear in things that be certain,
  or if we swear of a perverse custom, or of a purpose by God or his Saints in idle talk or
  anger. For he that is accustomed to swear, can not escape perjury.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE THIRD COMMANDMENT</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the third Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">R</font>emember that thou sanctify, &amp; keep holy the
  Sabbath day. In Moses law the people were commanded to sanctify </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 35]</p>
  <p align="left">&amp; keep holy the Sabbath day, which day we call Saturday, or the
  seventh day. For after that almighty God had created all kind of creatures in six days,
  the seventh day he rested or ceased to create any new creature. But in the law of grace we
  do not sanctify or keep holy the seventh day, called the Saturday: but we sanctify or keep
  holy the day following, called the Sunday or our Lord's day: in the which day christ our
  Lord arose from death, making mankind (that was created earthly) a heavenly creation, in
  the day of his resurrection. This precept of sanctifying or keeping holy the Sunday, or
  our Lord's day, does contain under it, all feasts &amp; holy days instituted &amp;
  commanded by the Church. And we do sanctify the holy day, when we apply ourselves to the
  worshipping of God. Therefore upon Sundays &amp; holy days we ought to search our
  conscience, and purge it from sin: we should cry &amp; call unto God for mercy &amp;
  grace, thanking him for his manifold benefits bestowed upon us: we ought to have in memory
  Christ's Passion, Paradise, Hell &amp; Purgatory, so to abstain from sin, &amp; exercise
  ourselves in things that be godly for our souls health: as in going to the Church, to pray
  devoutly, reverently to hear Mass, and other Divine service.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways is the holy day broken?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>our manner of ways. By servile work, by omitting
  the worshipping of God, by unreverence of holy things, by wanton or unlawful plays.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How is the holy-day broken by servile work or labor?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>f upon Sundays or holy days we work, or cause
  other to work any servile labor, that properly pertains to servants: as plowing, carting,
  digging, &amp; such like, or do use handy crafts, How be it for pity or necessity, some
  things be </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 36]</p>
  <p align="left">permitted to be done upon holy days: as dressing of meat, preparing of a
  medicine, burying the dead, &amp; such like. Also it is permitted upon holy days to
  exercise the liberal sciences, as to dispute, or study, to sing, or to play upon
  instruments. And if necessity do constrain to take a journey upon the holy day, it is
  permitted.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How is the holy day broken in omitting the worship of God?</em></p>
  <p><font size="5">I</font>f every Sunday and holy day we be not present at Divine service,
  &amp; if we do not hear wholly one Mass with a devout reverent mind: or if we do not say
  our Divine service that we be bound unto, if we be not confessed at Easter and receive the
  Sacrament. In omitting these and such like, we break the holy day.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How is the holy day broken, by unreverence of holy things?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>f we hear Mass unreverently, as talking, walking,
  gasing, or occupying ourselves idlely. And if we misuse the church or church yard, or
  pollute the same, or if we use anything forbidden by Christ or his Church, we break the
  holy day.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How is the holy day broken by plays, pastimes, or gaming?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>f we misspend the holy day in unthrifty games, as
  cards and dice for covetousness, or when we should be at Divine service: or if we use
  dancing for wantoness, or if we frequent taverns or bowling alleys, or if we use any
  dishonest place or company. By these ways &amp; such like we break the holy day, and so
  offend god.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT OF GOD.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the fourth Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">H</font>onor thy Father and Mother, that thy days may be
  long upon earth (Exo. 20).</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 37]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>In what things does the honor consist, that we must do to our
  Fathers and Mothers?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n three things. In reverence, obedience, and
  succoring them. (Ephe. 6. Col. 3.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How must we reverence our Fathers and Mothers?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n loving them, doing good to them, in praying for
  them, being afraid lest we should offend them in word or deed. In giving place to them: we
  must reverence them both in words and gesture.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How do we offend in not reverencing our parents?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst, if we neglect our natural parents, or
  kinsfolkes being in poverty or misery, if we deride or scorn them, or stir them to anger,
  or if we desire their death for hatred towards them, or for desire of inheritance, goods
  or honor, and by such like, we break gods precept.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we break the commandment of God, if we do not reverence our
  Prelates, Bishops, ghostly Fathers, &amp; other spiritual rulers and governers in Christ's
  Church, that have cure &amp; charge of souls. For whosoever does condemn, despise, or
  scorn either their carnal parents: or spiritual fathers: be accursed of God, as Cham was
  for laughing at his father Noah. (Rom. 13, Heb 13, 1 Pet. 2, Gen. 9)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we break this Commandment of God: if we do not reverence our
  God Fathers and God mothers, our superiors and elders both in age, gravity, wisdom, virtue
  and learning, or in office, authority and dignity.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>In what things must we obey our parents?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n all things appertaining to God, or good manners,
  in things that be honest and lawful. We must obey them by the example of our Saviour
  Christ, which was obedient to his parents. And as we be bound to obey our carnal parents,
  so we be bound to obey our Prelates, Bishops and spiritual govern-</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 38]</p>
  <p align="left">ours in Christ's Church: we are bound to obey their precepts, and firmly
  to keep their doctrine, that they have taught us, for our souls health.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must diligently take heed that we be not carried away with any
  strange heretical doctrine, &amp; that we entangle not ourselves in schism: steadfastly we
  must cleave and stick to the doctrine concerning faith and religion, that has been taught
  in Christ's Church by a succession of Pastors and Bishops coming linealy from the
  Apostles. Whose doctrine is derived from the Apostles to this day from one to another.
  Whosoever does not obey these spiritual Fathers, does greatly offend God.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>In what things must we succor our parents?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n comforting them: and ministering necessities to
  them. For if any be so unnatural: that they will not comfort them, when they be alive, and
  pray for them when they be dead: they break the commandment of God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also by this Commandment every man and woman is bound to pay truly
  their tithes to their Prelates, &amp; all other debts and duties due unto others.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as the children be bound to obey their parents, so fathers and
  mothers ought to give good example to their Children. But some parents seek so much to
  enrich their Children in worldly things: that they purchase everlasting damnation both to
  themselves: and to their children. Such parents show themselves to care only for the body:
  and not for the soul. If they see their Children in poverty or misery: they lament: but to
  see their Children in sinful life they little pass there of. (Ephe. 6)</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT<br>
  <em>What is the fifth Commandment of god?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt not kill. That is to be understood: thou
  shalt not without just authority kill or hurt any man in body or in </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 39]</p>
  <p align="left">soul. And therefore both the Judge in the commonwealth does lawfully put
  offenders to death, or otherwise punish them bodily, and the Bishop does lawfully
  excommunicate wicked or disobedient&nbsp; persons, for the preservation of peace &amp;
  tranquility in the commonwealth, &amp; in the church.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways do we break this Commandment?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>welve manner of ways. First if we kill, hurt or
  maim willfully ourselves, or any other: or if we command any man unjustly to be killed, or
  hurt or give counsel, aid or help there unto.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, If women by medicine, as by herbs, drinks, or by any other
  means kill their Children after their conception: Or if any man kill the Child in the
  mothers womb by strokes or by other means. Or if any man or woman procure bareness to
  themselves, or to any other.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, They break this Commandment, that by witchcraft, or by any
  such devilish means, be the cause of any mans death.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, They that shorten their life by surfeiting with meats and
  drinks, or by riotous wanton life.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, Princes, and such as be in authority, if they make laws to put
  innocents to death, or any man unjustly: as they that have made laws to put the holy
  Martyrs to death: for confessing Christ: and the Catholic faith.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, They that of malice do wish hurt death or damnation to any
  man: or they that rejoice of any mans adversity: or be sorry to hear of other mens
  felicity or they that speak contemptuously of any man: or they that desire God to take
  vengeance upon any man or woman.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventhly, They that neglect to succor &amp; help them: that be in
  extreme necessity. Saint Ambrose does say feed them that be like to die for hunger: for if
  thou do not feed hast killed.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 40]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighthly, They that do imagine hurt or displeasure to
  any man: or make conspiracies, or take counsel to imprison, to vex or trouble innocents,
  or any man for a godly cause, as for the Catholic faith, or Religion.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ninthly, They that have offended any man, and will not ask forgiveness.
  And they that will not forgive them which have offended, but will do evil for evil.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenthly, They that kill the souls of the people with heresy, or wicked
  doctrine, or counsel, whereby souls are brought to damnation. And they that corrupt youth
  with wicked doctrine, or by any means corrupt good manners.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleventhly, They that show evil example in word, or deed, and they that
  will not admonish their neighbor offending.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelfthly, Fathers, Mothers, and Schoolmasters, if they do not correct
  Children offending with the rod discretely: for he that spareth the rod, hateth the child
  (said Solomon - Prov. 23) They that will not correct the children offending, kill their
  souls. By correcting Children with the rod: fathers mothers: and masters may deliver the
  Childrens souls from hell. Therefore it is better to be unborn, then untaught. But in
  doing correction: anger must follow reason: &amp; be ruled by reason.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must beware, that we break not this fifth Commandment of God, in any
  of these twelve ways before said.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT<br>
  <em>What is the sixth Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt not commit adultery. (Exo. 20) Under this
  Commandment is forbidden all unlawful company in lechery: whether it be fornication
  between unmarried persons (1 Cor. 6, Matt. 5): deflowering of virgins, rape: incest
  between kinsfolks: sacrilege as pretended marriage of priests or between religious
  persons, or in sin against nature: which is most horrible in the sight of God. Also they </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 41]</p>
  <p align="left">that be unlawfully married &amp; inordinately give themselves to carnal
  lust. For the special cause of marriage ought to be, for procreation of Children. And
  under this precept is also forbidden all consent in delectation, &amp; voluptuous pleasure
  of carnal concupiscence and lechery: an dishonest handling or touching themselves or
  others for lust or unlawful appetite, whereby nature is stirred, or concupiscence kindled.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In like manner they that suffer others willingly &amp; dishonestly to
  touch or handle them. Also by inordinate or lascivious kissing or clipping, by bawdy
  songs: or dishonest talking, or by any dissolute behaviour: as wanton &amp; unchaste
  sight, dancing to the intent to procure wanton love, or to move any to filthy sin. Also
  they that be bawdes, to bring any persons together to commit sin: or they that give
  counsel, aid, succor or help there unto in word or in deed. Finally if in our hearts we
  give a full and deliberate consent to filthy sin of the flesh: which may come of unchaste
  sight: or talking, or of filthy thoughts, and imaginations: although we do not accomplish
  our filthy lust neither in deed, nor in words, yet we may offend deadly. By all these ways
  afore said we may break the sixth Commandment of God, and so set ourselves in a damnable
  state.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What means must we use to avoid the filthy sin of the flesh?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst we must consider: that lechery corrupts every
  age, it confounds all the senses, it breaks all order, it perverts every degree, it
  assaults young and old, men, and women, wise and simple: superiors and inferiors, it
  weakens the body: and kills the soul, it lessens good fame: and offends the neighbor, it
  lessens God: and wins the Devil, it dulls the wit: and makes men beastly: of the temple
  and members of Christ (Ephe. 5), it makes the temple and members of the Devil. Fornicators
  and unclean livers shall have no inheritance in the Kingdom of (Apo. 21)</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 42]</p>
  <p align="left">god: but their portion and part shall be in the lake that burns with fire
  and brimstone. Saint Hierome compares lechery to hellfire, whose flame is pride, whose
  sparks are ungodly talk, whose smoke is infamy, whose end is poverty, misery and hellfire.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider moreover, the more any man gives himself to voluptuous carnal
  pleasure, willing to satisfy this filthy concupiscence: the more shall his desire
  increase, and the less shall he be satisfied. It is but a moment: that this filthy lust
  delights: but the painful torments due for the same, be eternal in hellfire. That they
  will avoid this filthy sin: first must keep their hearts clean from idle filthy thoughts,
  by holy meditations of Christ &amp; his Saints. Secondly, they must shut up their eyes
  from vain aspects, and their ears from ungodly talk. Thirdly, they must shut up their
  mouths from all talk sounding to sin, and use devout prayer. Fourthly, they must chastise
  their bodies with abstinence and fasting, watching and exercising of some godly labor:
  &amp; flee from idleness and evil company: so by the help of Gods grace this filthy
  damnable sin may be avoided.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT<br>
  <em>What is the seventh Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt commit no theft (Exo. 20). By this
  Commandment we are forbidden, to take, keep, or occupy anything that is an other mans
  against the right owners will, by violence, fraud, or deceit.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many ways do we break this precept?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">S</font>eventeen ways. First by sacrilege, as robbing of
  Churches, taking anything away that is dedicated to God or to his Saints, out of the
  Churches or hallowed place, &amp; putting it to profane use.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 43]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly by Simony, in buying, or selling, or making
  any Simoniacal pact for spiritual gifts or ecclesiastical promotion: as patrons that
  nominate or give any ecclesiastical benefice or promotion for profit or gains (Act. 8),
  either to themselves, or to some friend of theirs. They also break this commandment, that
  obtain holy Orders by giving of money or money worth: and they that give money for any
  Ecclesiastical promotion or promise any part of their benefice or spiritual living, to the
  intent to obtain any such spiritual living. Whosoever does so give or receive any such
  spiritual living, does not only commit grievous sin, but ought to be deprived, and make
  restitution to the Church.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, by usury in lending money, to the intent to have the same sums
  of money again with gains either in money or money worth (Psal. 14). All such usurers are
  bound to make restitution to the party. Yet he is urged with great necessity, &amp; can
  help himself by no other means, does not offend in borrowing money &amp; promising gain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, by theft, spoiling or robbing openly or secretly.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, by deceiving or defrauding, or by any means doing wrong to
  children during their nonage.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, by bargaining or buying anything of servants, or of any that
  have no authority to sell.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventhly, they that will not pay their debts or wages that they owe to
  any man.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighthly, they that use extortion, polling, or oppression of their
  subjects or tenants.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ninthly, scholars that receive money of their parties to buy
  necessities with, if they bestow it upon vanities.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenthly, they that deceive any man in paying counterfeited money or
  gold for good and lawful, although they have received the same for good of others.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleventhly, they that hurt or destroy other mens goods, either </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 44]</p>
  <p align="left">openly or privily, and they that will not make a recompense for hurt done
  to their power.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelfthly, they that do not their work truly, that they are hired to
  work: and they are bound to make restitution of the damage and loss.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirteenthly, they that retain or keep anything that they have found
  which another has lost by negligence against his will. For what you have found&nbsp; and
  not restored, you have stolen (if you know the owner.) And if by diligent search and
  inquisition you can not find the right owner, you are bound to give unto the poor, what
  you have found.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourteenthly, they that use untrue weights or measures in buying or
  selling, or they that sell that for good, which they know to be nought: or sell one thing
  for another, whereby the buyer is deceived or in bargaining use crafty or subtle words.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteenthly, they that use craft or deceit in gaining for covetousness
  such are bound to make restitution.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixteenthly, he that takes and Action unjustly against any man for
  gains, or does give counsel and or consent: or they that praise any man in a naughty act,
  or they that hold their peace, when they may let an evil deed deceit, or unrighteousness
  to be done to any man.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventeenthly, they that be in authority, if they do not make laws,
  &amp; provision to their power, to repress all injuries, wrongs and deceits before said
  for in all these seventeen ways the Commandment of God is broken.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT<br>
  <em>What is the eighth Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt bear no false witness against thy
  neighbor. First, by this commandment is forbidden all hurtful lying, whether it be in
  judgment, or in common and familiar talk: whereby hurt cometh to any man or woman.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 45]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it is forbidden, to slander or to speak evil
  of any man, or to manifest the secret sin of any man.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it is forbidden, to dispraise, or diminish the good deeds or
  acts of any man, to bring him out of favor of estimation.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, it is forbidden to use craft to hide the truth, being called
  in judgment to witness the truth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, it is forbidden, to deride or scorn others with scornful
  words, or to object a crime to do displeasure to any man or woman.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, it is forbidden to detract or impair the good name or fame of
  any that is absent whether they say true or false, they ought to restore their good name
  and fame.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventhly, it is forbidden to take pleasure to hear evil spoken of any
  man or woman: for every man ought to answer for his neighbor, to defend his good fame.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eighthly, he does offend God grievously, that does defame or slander
  himself.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ninthly, they that curse themselves or others with evil words of
  mischief, or vengeance, or such like ungodly words: &amp; also they that ask vengeance or
  mischief upon unreasonable creatures, such as cattle, corn, ground, &amp; such like, break
  Gods precept.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenthly, it is forbidden to judge rashly, or to take, or to interpret
  the words or deeds of any man in the worst part: for in things that be doubtful, we ought
  to judge the best.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleventhly, it is forbidden to use whispering: with contentious words
  to provoke any man to wrath: or to set dissention between party, and party, or to cause
  dissention to continue.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelfthly, it is forbidden to use flattery as to praise any man or
  woman of a deed that is deadly sin or to praise any many or woman to the intent to hurt
  them in body, or soul or by flattering or praising to be the cause of deadly sin.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirteenthly, it is forbidden, to use dissimilation in words or </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 46]</p>
  <p align="left">deeds, Also is is forbidden, to break honest and lawful promises.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourteenthly, it is forbidden, to hurt the souls of the people with
  heresy and false doctrine, contrary to the Catholic faith whereby the people are deceived
  and brought into state of damnation. Heretics bear false witness with the Devil against
  christ &amp; his dear spouse the Catholic Church. They maintain falsity against the truth
  &amp; although they be punished or put to death by burning or other wise: yet they receive
  no crown of Martyrdom, but they receive punishment worthily for their infidelity and false
  witness against the truth. So heretics be Children, Martyrs, and witnesses for the Devil
  against Christ &amp; his Church. Thus all manner of lies are to be detested, and are
  forbidden by the Commandment of God.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE NINTH COMMANDMENT.<br>
  <em>What is the ninth Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt not covet or unlawfully desire thy
  neighbors wife maid or daughter. As in the sixth commandment all carnal lust outwardly
  appertaining to the sin of the flesh is forbidden: so in this precept is forbidden all
  inward concupiscence and unlawful carnal desire of thy neighbors wife daughter, or maid,
  in heart &amp; mind for may are chaste in body, that have committed adultery or lechery in
  will. Christ saith in mind to commit carnal act with her: already in his heart he has
  committed lechery with her: for although the thoughts be hidden from man: &amp; cannot be
  judged by mans law: yet all things that we imagine or think in our hearts, are open and
  unhid to the eyes of God. And the will &amp; intent that is ready to commit sin, is repute
  before god as the fact and deed done, being letted against the will. For he that hath a
  full will to co-</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 47]</p>
  <p align="left">mmit lechery, if opportunity of time would serve: breaketh this
  Commandment. Also they that be negligent to resist temptations or to repress &amp; refrain
  the passions or concupiscence of the flesh, or suffer thoughts of carnality to continue
  with delectation in their minds. For everyone ought to defend their chastity, as their
  lives. Finally, they that trim or deck themselves to allure &amp; provoke others to their
  carnal love, or use flattery or dissimulation to provoke other to sin: all such break the
  commandment of god.</p>
  <p align="center">OF THE TENTH COMMANDMENT.<br>
  <em>What is the tenth Commandment of God?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hou shalt not covet thy neighbors goods. As in the
  eighth Commandment, the outward act of theft, damage and hindrance is forbidden to be done
  to thy neighbor in his soul, body, or goods: so in this tenth Commandment is forbidden the
  inward will &amp; desire unjustly to have thy neighbors goods. For they that refrain to
  take or keep their neighbors goods only for fear of worldly punishment or shame, break
  this precept. And they that be ready in mind and will, to put forth their money to usury,
  or to be in will to steal: to take any mans goods to keep them, or hurt them or to
  withhold anything that is found, if opportunity to time would serve there unto: all such
  break this Commandment. Also they that play at any game for the intent to get their
  neighbors goods break this Commandment.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also they that covet to have any Ecclesiastical promotion, authority,
  and dignity by unlawful means, break this Commandment. No man may do evil, to the intent
  that goodness may come thereof: and much more grievously they offend God, that desire
  goods: lands dignities, or promotion, to maintain their solace and worldly pleasure.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 48]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the sum of the ten Commandments?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he sum of the ten Commandments does consist in the
  love towards god, and our neighbor (Ephe. 4., Matt. 7.).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first Table be three Commandments: which take away and forbid
  sin and vice against the worshipping of God. They forbid idolatry, apostasy, heresy,
  superstition, perjury, blasphemy, and move us to the pure and true worshipping of God in
  heart, word and deed. In the Second table be seven Commandments, which command us to give
  reverence and honor to every man in his degree, to profit all, and hurt none: to do unto
  others, as we would be done to ourselves.<br>
  <a name="48"></a></p>
  <p align="center">OF THE FIVE COMMANDMENTS OF THE CHURCH.<br>
  <em>Ne dimittas legem matris.<br>
  </em>Forsake not the law of thy mother. (Prov. I)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many Commandments be there of the Church that we be bound to
  keep?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>here be five precepts especially Commanded by our
  mother the catholic church christs dear spouse, which we are bound to keep (Mar. I.). For
  if we should be disobedient children to our mother the catholic Church, &amp; not obey her
  precepts, we can not have God to be our loving father (Cyprianus).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first precept is, that we celebrate and keep holy days commanded by
  the Catholic church. As in the old Testament the people were bound to celebrate diverse
  feasts beside the Sabbath day: so in the new Testament we are bound to celebrate diverse
  feasts besides the Sunday (Concil. Lugd. Holy days).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second precept is, that every Sunday and holy day we reverently
  hear Mass (2. Mass. Concil. Agath.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third precept is, that we keep the fasting days commanded by the
  Church: and obstain from such meats as the Church does prohibit &amp; forbid (3. Can.
  Apost. 68).</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 49]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, every man &amp; woman once in the year is
  bound to be confessed of all their sins to their own Curate: or to some discreet Priest
  that has authority to absolve them of their sins (4. Concil. Later. Confession).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth precept is that every man &amp; woman having reason &amp;
  discretion: once in the year at the least, receive the blessed Sacrament of the Altar, and
  especially at Easter time. These and such like precepts of the Church we are bound to
  observe and keep. The observing of these precepts and such like is both profitable, &amp;
  necessary (5. Concil. Later.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, for the exercise of our faith, humility, and Christian
  obedience.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, because they nourish, keep and maintain godly worship, honest
  discipline, and public tranquility, and marvelously set forth all things in a decent order
  in christs church.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the charitable keeping of them brings everlasting life: but
  the condemning of these precepts and such like of holy church brings everlasting
  damnation.<br>

  <p align="center">THE FIVE SENSES.<br>
  <em>Exhibete membra vestra seruire iustitice, in sanctificationem.<br>
  </em>Bestow your members to serve justice for sanctification.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many outward senses hath God given to us?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>ive: Sight, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, &amp;
  Touching: the which Senses we ought to use to the honor of God, to the health of our
  souls, &amp; the necessary use of our bodies. And except with great diligence we keep
  &amp; refrain the said outward Senses, they be as open windows for sin and death to enter
  in at, to our souls.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has given to us our eyes that we may see to flee from such things
  as be hurtful, either to our bodies or to our souls:</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 50]</p>
  <p align="left">and keep such things as be good &amp; necessary. And as this sense of
  sight is more excellent then other senses, so is it more perilous: for except our sight be
  restrained and ruled by reason, it does allure and entice us to many sins.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, they offend God by sight that take pleasure to look upon their
  own comliness of body or clothing: and such like.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that with proud looks turn their eyes from place to place.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also, that give their eyes unchastly to look upon any: for a
  wanton and unchaste eye is a sign of an unchaste heart and mind.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that idly behold the gesture or gate of any.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that seeing another mans felicity, be sorry, or seeing another
  mans calamity rejoice.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that for hatred, disdain to look upon any man.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that seeing another mans goods, desire the same.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they that take pleasure, to look upon filthiness, or any
  ungodliness.<br>
  All such as are before spoken of, misspend their sense of sight, &amp; commit sin. God
  hath given to us our ears, to hear such things as be good and honest. God being a
  marvelous craftsman, would that man should have two ears, and but one tongue, to the
  intent he should hear more, then he should speak. Our ears are given to us, to perceive
  the doctrine of God, for our souls health.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these ways following, we do misspend our sense of hearing, and so
  offend God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we be angry (more then reason does permit) when we hear anything
  that does not please us.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take pride to hear our own praise.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take pleasure to hear lascivious or wanton talk, scoffing,
  flattering or slanderous words.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 51]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take pleasure to hear heresy or devilish
  doctrine.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has given to us the sense of smelling, whereof the nose is an
  instrument, to draw sweet smells to the brain, that be profitable to the body &amp; not
  hurtful to the soul. These ways following, we may misspend the sense of smelling.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If inordinately we be delighted with the pleasant smell of delicious
  meats, desiring the same.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If for lasciviousness or voluptuousness, we be delighted with sweet
  odours, ointments, powders or perfumes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we abhor the poor or sick &amp; be over careful, least we should
  feel the odor or smell them.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has given to us the sense of tasting, whereof the tongue is an
  instrument, to taste or discern savour or taste in such things as be for the nourishment
  of the body, &amp; not hurtful to the soul. This sense of tasting, except it be ruled by
  reason, it brings many infirmities to the body, &amp; is cause of sin.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do misspend this sense of tasting by surfetts of meats or
  drunkenness, or being overmuch delighted in delicious meats &amp; drinks: And in breaking
  fasting days, or in eating flesh or other meats for deliciousness, at such times as the
  Church does prohibit and forbid the same.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has given to us the sense of touching, which consists in all parts
  of the body, but especially in the hands: for there is a multitude of vaines &amp; sins
  come together. This sense is given to us, that we should use it to the profit of our
  bodies and souls.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do misspend this sense of touching: If we in malice we kill, wound,
  or strike any man. If we steal, rob, or take anything unjustly. If we unchastly touch
  ourselves or any other. And as we do misspend these five sense, so we do misuse other
  parts of our bodies, and let sin enter into our souls.</p>

  <p align="center">CHAP. 4. (<em>Of the 7 Sacraments.</em>)<br>
  <em>Sapientia cedisicauit sibi domum, &amp; excidit septem columnas </em>(Prov. 5.).<em><br>
  </em>Sapence has built her a house, and has cut out seven pillars.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is a Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font> Sacrament is a visible form of an invisible grace,
  which is instituted of God for our sanctification (Aug. li. 3. de doctri. Christia.). In
  every Sacrament is an outward form or manner that we may see with our corporal eyes: under
  the which lies hidden an invisible grace, that we can not see with our corporal eyes:
  which we must firmly believe (Amb. li. 4. Sacra.). As in Baptism we see the Child washed
  in water, and we hear the words of Baptism spoken, but invisibly the grace of the Holy
  Ghost does purge the Child from sin: So the flesh is washed, that the soul may be purged.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many Sacraments did Christ institute?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">S</font>even, which be expressed in the Scripture: &amp;
  they have continually been kept in the Catholic Church, &amp; used by tradition from the
  Apostles, from man to man, until these our days. The sacraments be these: Baptism,
  Confirmation, Penance the Sacrament of the Altar, Extreme unction, Order: and Marriage,
  the which concerning the invisible grace that they give to the worthy receivers of them,
  take their efficacy &amp; strength of the merits of Christs Passion.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why did Christ institute these seven Sacraments?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">C</font>hrist did institute the Sacraments for four causes.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to be medicines and preservatives against sin.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to be means &amp; helps to the keeping of the Commandments of
  God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, to induce us to humility and obedience, to bring us to
  knowledge and exercise of virtue in the fear of God.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 53]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, to be instruments or vessels, whereby God
  does pour abundantly his mercy and grace into our souls, &amp; makes us apt to receive the
  fruit and benefits of his Passion.<br>
  <a name="53"></a></p>
  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM.<br>
  <em>What is Baptism?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">B</font>aptism is the most necessary Sacrament of the new
  Testament, instituted of Christ, specially to wash away original sin, &amp; all other sin
  done before Baptism. By baptism we be regenerated &amp; born again of water and the holy
  Ghost, and made Children of God by adoption &amp; heirs of the Kingdom of heaven: Without
  Baptism: either in act or in will, note can be saved. (Joh. 3, Rom. 6, Gala. 3)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the effect of Baptism?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he effect of this Sacrament is to wash away all
  manner of sin so clean, that no satisfaction is to be enjoined: for if any die after
  Baptism, before they commit sin, their souls go straight to heaven.(Concill.Florent.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>In what things does Baptism consist?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n two things especially, the matter and form. The
  matter is water, a simple element (Concil. Florent.). No Baptism can be in wine, rose
  water, or any confect liquour. The form is the words of Baptism, which are: <em>Ego te
  baptiso in nomine Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti: </em>or I Christen thee, in
  the name of the Father, &amp;&nbsp; the Son, and the holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who is the minister of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left">Ordinarily the priest is the minister of the Sacrament of Baptism, but in
  time of necessity a deacon, or a layman, &amp; in the absence of a man: a woman may
  baptize, or for lack of other </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 54]</p>
  <p align="left">an Heretic or paynim may Christen: so that they keep the form, and have
  the matter, having an intent to do that which the Catholic church does. But it is to be
  noted, that the minister, when he dips the Child in the water, or puts water upon his
  head, which is the principal part of the Child at the same instant time must speak the
  words of Baptism.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any layman or woman take upon them to Christen a Child, except it be
  in peril of death (when a Priest can not be had) they offend God grievously in the sin of
  presumption.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether may one be Christened twice?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">O</font>ne Person can be christened but once. Baptism can
  not be iterated in any one Person: for Baptism does impress &amp; give a Character or a
  distinct spiritual sign, that can not be done away.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What do Godfathers and Godmothers for Children in Baptism?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">G</font>odfathers and Godmothers become sureties for
  children, and do promise in the Childrens name, that they shall forsake the Devil, and all
  his works &amp; pomps. Godfathers &amp; Godmothers also become surities for Children, and
  promise, that they shall believe all the Articles of the Creed. Therefore Godfathers and
  Godmothers ought diligently to look to their charge, when to teach them, or cause them to
  be taught the Catholic faith and Pater noster.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why be ceremonies used in Baptism?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">C</font>eremonies be used in baptism partly against the

  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he flesh is signed and crossed, that the soul may
  be armed and defended. The sign of the cross is made in the childs forehead, which is a
  place of shamefastness, that the child should never be ashamed to confess the faith of
  Christ. The sign of the cross is made upon the childs breast, steadfastly to believe the
  faith of christ. The sign of the cross is made in the childs hand to bless itself, &amp;
  defend itself from the Devil, and all adversities, and to abide in the Catholic faith.
  (The sign of the cross. Tertul.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why is Salt put into the childs mouth?</em></p>

  by spitting, and touching his tongue (Mat. 7): that the childs ears may be open, to hear
  wholesome doctrine, &amp; to savour and taste that, which is godly.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why does the Priest anoint the child with holy Oil upon the breast
  and back?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he child is anointed upon the breast with holy Oil,

  <p align="left">[pg. 56]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child is anointed upon the back with holy Oil, to

  Christians: so the flesh is anointed, that the soul may be consecrated and hallowed to
  everlasting life.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What does the Chrism signify?</em></p>

  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION.<br>
  <em>What is Confirmation?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">C</font>onfirmation is a Sacrament (Act. 8), whereby the
  grace, that was given in Baptism, is confirmed &amp; made more strong by the seven gifts
  of the holy Ghost (Con. Flor.). For although the visible sign of the holy Ghost does now
  cease, that was manifestly seen in the Apostles time (Act. 19): yet the same grace
  invisible is given in Confirmation.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>In what things does the substance of this Sacrament consist?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he substance of this Sacrament consists in the
  matter and the form: The matter is holy Chrism confect and made of oil olive and balm
  (Concil Florent.), consecrated of a Bishop, and </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 57]</p>
  <p align="left">every year it is renewed, and the old Chrism burned. The oil does signify
  the cleanness of conscience by the infusion of grace, and the fervent zeal of charity
  toward the maintenance of Christs faith: wherewith he is indued that is Confirmed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The balm does signify the odor of good fame, and also the sweetness of
  Gods holy spirit, wherewith Christ does allure and draw us to his service.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The form is the words of Confirmation that the Bishop does speak, when
  he makes the sign of the Cross upon the forehead, with holy Chrism.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who is the minister of this Sacrament of Confirmation?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n this Sacrament the holy Ghost is given to make
  them that be confirmed more strong in grace: as the holy Ghost was given to the Apostles
  in the day of Pentecost: so in Confirmation grace is given, boldly to confess the name of
  Christ and all things belonging to a Christian man. Therefore whosoever is confirmed, has
  a Cross made in his forehead with holy Chrism, where as is the seat of shamefastness:
  least he should be ashamed to confess Christ, &amp; that he is a Christian.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What Ceremonies be used in Confirmation?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst, he or she that cometh to be confirmed, must
  have one godfather or on godmother (that is already confirmed,) to hold them up to the
  Bishop.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, they that receive confirmation, have a blow on the cheek
  given to them of the bishop, in remembrance that they must suffer patiently &amp; gladly
  rebukes and tribulation for the name of Christ and righteousness sake.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 58]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, they that receive confirmation, for the space
  of three days ought to have and bear about with them, a band, in signification, that
  christ lay three days in his sepulchre, &amp; upon the third day they that be confirmed,
  but be brought to the Priest, and then in the holy place the Priest washes of the chrism
  with salt and water, and burns the band, casting the ashes in the Churchyard.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some countries they use to tie the band upon the forehead of them
  that be confirmed, where the bishop made the sign of the Cross with holy Chrism.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In England they use to tie the band about the childs neck, and upon the
  third day the Priest loosed the band, and there with washed of the holy Chrism with holy
  water.<br>

  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE<br>
  <em>What is Penance?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">P</font>enance is a Sacrament, whereby a penitent sinner is
  purged, absolved, and made clean from sin. For if any commit deadly sin after Baptism, the
  only refuge is to the Sacrament of Penance: without which Sacrament in act or in will,
  they that have committed mortal sin can not be saved. (John 20., Concil Florent.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the matter of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he matter of the Sacrament of Penance is the humble
  &amp; true confession of a penitent sinner, that is contrite in heart for the sin
  committed: plainly confessing before the Priest (sitting in Gods stead) the sin done,
  being in will and mind not to commit sin again, and being content to do satisfaction by
  the appointment of his ghostly Father.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the form of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he form of the Sacrament of penance is the words of
  absolution, that the Priest speaks over the sinner: by</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 59]</p>
  <p align="left">virtue of the which the holy Ghost works remission and forgiveness of sin,
  so that the sinner being penitent is purged and made clean from sin, as he was in baptism:
  saving that the penitent sinner after confession must do penance, or suffer pains for his
  sin, either in this life, or in Purgatory.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many parts of Penance be there?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hree: Contrition in heart, Confession with mouth to
  a ghostly Father, and Satisfaction in works: so that whosoever will be purged and made
  clean from sin, must be sorry in heart for the sin done, willing to offend no more, and
  then plainly confess the sin with the circumstances thereof: as how often, the place, the
  time, age, &amp; degree of persons, naming none by name.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These circumstances may alter and change the kind &amp; nature of the
  sin, they may aggravate or diminish the sin. Thirdly, the sinner must bring forth fruit of
  penance by the appointment of his ghostly Father.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who is the minister of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he priest is the minister, whose office is to hear
  the Confession, and then to discern between sin and sin: to give counsel how to avoid the
  occasion of sin, and there upon to enjoin penance, &amp; to pronounce the words of
  absolution over the penitents sins.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many manner of sins may be forgiven by this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>wo manner of sins, deadly sin, and venial: but
  deadly sin can not be forgiven without this Sacrament, in deed or in will. Venial sin may
  be purged by prayer, almsdeeds, by the worth receiving of the Blessed Sacrament of the
  altar, by taking of holy water, knocking upon the breast, with holy meditation, the
  Bishops blessing and such like.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 60]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How shall we discern deadly sin from venial sin?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">D</font>eadly sin so much displeases God, that thereby we
  be separated from God &amp; charity, in such sort, that dying therein, without this
  Sacrament of penance in act or in will it brings everlasting damnation. (Eph 5.) The
  scripture notes, that all fornicators, adulterers, unclean livers, thieves, robbers,
  extortioners oppressors unlawful covetous persons, common drunkards, slanderers, wicked
  speakers, idolaters, unbelievers witches, sorcerers, they that be malicious enemies,
  contentious persons, brawlers, and chiders, dissentious persons, they that make sects or
  divisions, manslayers, and they that deny God for fear of man: these and such like commit
  deadly sin, and dying therein without Penance, they shall have no inheritance in the
  kingdom of heaven: but their portion and part shall be in the lake that burns with fire
  and brimstone. (Phil. 3, Col. 3, Apo 21)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the foresaid sins we may offend deadly, three ways.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In deeds, or acts, as in satisfying our malice, contempt or in ordinate
  concupiscence, in the sins before said. In words, advisedly expressing our malice or
  concupiscence in the sins before said. In our thoughts, imagining with consent, by
  deliberation &amp; delectation, any evil or displeasure to any man or giving full consent
  with deliberation to the suggestion of the devil &amp; carnal concupiscence: where the
  will &amp; intent is counted for the deed of deadly sin before God. (Mat. 21, Mat. 16)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Venial sin is committed by acts &amp; deeds, wherein is neither malice,
  nor contempt, but curiosity or vanity: as idle words and thoughts without consent of evil.
  By venial sin we be not destitute of grace, nor separated from subjection to God, not we
  do not lose our Charity: but yet thereby our souls be darkened, &amp; we are made less apt
  to any good work and a temporal pain is due for venial sin, either in this life, or in
  Purgatory, if we be not purged by such means, as God and holy Church </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 61]</p>
  <p align="left">has ordained for the same. But exactly to determine and judge of venial
  sin appertains to God, and not to man.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the effect of the Sacrament of Penance?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he effect of the Sacrament of Penance, is to purge
  a sinner, and absolve him from all sin, to restore him to the Church, to reconcile him to
  God, to enrich him with spiritual gifts, and of the child of the devil to make him the
  child of God.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How must they behave themselves that would be confessed?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey must humbly kneel down at the Priests feet, and
  make the sign of the Cross upon their breast, and bless them in the name of the Father,
  and the Son, and the holy Ghost, and then say, Benedicite, And when the priest has given
  them a benediction, they must begin to acknowledge themselves sinners to God our Lady
  Blessed Mary, with all the holy company of heaven before their ghostly father sitting in
  Gods stead: then plainly express &amp; declare their sins committed in thought, word, and
  deed, in breaking the Commandments of God: and how they have offended in the seven deadly
  sins, and branches of the same, in misspending the five outward senses, in not fulfilling
  the seven works of mercy bodily and ghostly. These things with the circumstances declared,
  the Priest will give the penitent sinner counsel how to avoid sin, and upon Penance
  enjoined, give him absolution.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether may every Priest hear confessions and give absolution?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font>lthough every Priest in extreme necessity may hear
  confessions and give absolution yet such priests as be heretics, or excommunicated,
  suspended or condemned ordinarily, may not loose, nor bind. Every man and woman is bound
  to be confessed of their own proper curate: except either by license</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 62]</p>
  <p align="left">of their own curate, or otherwise they have license from the Bishop or
  superior authority, to choose them a discrete Priest to be their ghostly Father.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether may every Curat of his ordinary authority absolve for every
  sin?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">N</font>o. For there be some sins so grievous, that none
  may absolve, but the Pope or his Legate: as burning of Churches, violent striking a
  Priest, and counterfeiting of the Popes letters or Bulls. Some sins appertain to the
  Bishop, or his Penitentiary to absolve: as incest between kinsfolks, deflowering of
  virgins, manslaughter, breakers of vows, perjurers, witches, sorcerers, robbers of
  Churches, they that strike their Fathers or Mothers, Sodomites, burners of houses, they
  that overlie their Children, blasphemers, heretics, adulterers, an such like. Whosoever
  has committed any of these, ought to go to the Bishop, or to his Penitentiary for
  absolution.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How often in the year is every man and women bound to go to
  confession?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">E</font>very man &amp; woman is bound (at the least) once
  in the year (at Lent) to go to Confession: and as often as they receive the blessed
  Sacrament of the Altar, if they know or suspect themselves to be in deadly sin.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether is any man or woman bound, to iterate and confess<br>
  again any sins, that they have once confessed to a Priest?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>n three cases we are bound, to iterate and confess
  again our sins.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, if the Priest that we were confessed of, lacked authority to
  absolve such sins as we had done.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 63]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, if the Priest that we were confessed of,
  lacked discretion &amp; knowledge, to discern and judge our sins.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, if we have divided our confession, showing part to one Priest,
  and part to another, by means of whereof our ghostly father could not plainly understand
  our sins with the circumstances.<br>

  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR.<br>
  <em>What is the Sacrament of the Altar?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t is a Sacrament, wherein is contained the body and
  blood of our Saviour Christ: which is consecrated upon the Altar by a lawful Priest at
  Mass. (Mat. 16., 1 Cor. 1., Concil Latera.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the matter of the Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he matter of the Sacrament is bread of wheat, and
  wine of the wine mixed with water: which does signify the blood and water that did flow
  out of Christs side, when he was pierced to the heart with a spear.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the form of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he form of this Sacrament is the words of Christ
  wherewith this Sacrament is made, for the Priest speaks in person of Christ. By virtue of
  the words of Consecration in substance of bread is turned &amp; changed into the very body
  of Christ. And the substance of wine is turned into the blood of Christ, the holy ghost
  working by a divine power: so that Christ is wholly under the form of bread, &amp; in
  every part of the Host being broken, christ is wholly. And under the form of wine, &amp;
  every part thereof being separated, Christ is wholly.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 64]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the effect of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he effect of this Sacrament is to knit, join and
  incorporate the worthy receivers thereof unto Christ. By the worthy receiving of this
  blessed Sacrament grace is increased, virtue is nourished, steadfastness is given against
  frailty, strength against temptation, the merits of Christs Passion are revived in us, our
  bodies &amp; souls are spiritually nourished with this blessed Sacrament (being the
  blessed fruit of holy Mary) to be a medicine, to expel the poison that came to all mankind
  by the fruit that our first parent tasted of, in Paradise. As the fruit brought
  everlasting death and damnation, so this blessed Sacrament is a pledge, to bring us to
  everlasting life, and to restore us to the joy that was lost by our first parents. (Concil
  Florent.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who is the minister of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he Minister is a priest lawfully ordained and
  consecrated by a Bishop. It is required, that the Priest does consecrate at Mass, having
  an intent to consecrate the body and blood of Christ.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who is bound to receive this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">E</font>very Christian man and woman having discretion,
  that is twelve years of age and elder, is bound at every Easter time to receive &amp; at
  other times as their devotion will serve them (Concil. Latera.). In the primitive Church
  the people used often to receive, as every Sunday. Afterward devotion began something to
  decay, that customably the people received three times in the year: as at Christmas,
  Easter, &amp; Pentecost. Then afterward devotion waxed so cold, that it was thought good
  to the Church, to make a law, that every man and woman upon pain of deadly sin, should
  receive the Blessed Sacrament at Easter time at the least. And it is convenient, that
  every christian man and </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 65]</p>
  <p align="left">woman against death receive this Sacrament, to be their voyage provision.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How ought every man and woman to prepare themselves to receive the
  blessed Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>irst, they ought diligently to examine their own
  conscience ( 1 Co. 11.) and if they perceive any deadly sin in them, with a penitent heart
  they ought to confess their sin to a discrete Ghostly Father, they have authority to
  absolve them from their sins: so having their conscience purged from sin, &amp; with a
  fervent and reverent devotion, worshipping Christ in the blessed Sacrament, they may
  safely receive. For as the benefit is great in the worthy receivers, so the unworthy
  receive their own damnation.<br>

  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION<br>
  <em>What is the Sacrament of extreme Unction?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">E</font>xtreme unction or anointing is a Sacrament, wherein
  the sick persons (by holy Oil and the words of christ) are relieved, that more happily
  they may depart out of this world, and also that their bodies may be restored to health,
  if it be expedient. (Jacob. 5., Concil Florent.) This Sacrament is to ministered to men
  and women lying in extreme sickness in peril of death, by Gods visitation, and not by
  violence of war, or execution. And this Sacrament is not to be ministered unto infants,
  and such as lack reason: for none ought to receive this Sacrament, but such as have
  reason, &amp; humbly desire it for gods sake.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the matter of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he matter is oil olive hallowed by a Bishop,
  wherewith the sick is anointed upon the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, hands, &amp; feet. A man
  is anointed upon the reines of the back, and a </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 66]</p>
  <p align="left">woman upon the belly: because concupiscence reigns most in those parts.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the form of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he form is the words, that the Priest speaks, when

  <p align="center"><em>What is the effect of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he effect of this Sacrament of anointing is, to put
  away and purge venial sin committed by misspending of our senses &amp; to purge and put
  away sins forgotten.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Sacrament is comfortable to the soul, and healthful to the body,
  as much as is expedient. And in this Sacrament the holy Ghost does strengthen the sick
  with grace against the violent assault of the Devil, and the terror of death.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who is the Minister of this Sacrament of Extreme Unction or

  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF ORDER.<br>
  <em>What is the Sacrament of Order?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">O</font>rder is a Sacrament, wherein grace or a spiritual
  power is given to Priests, &amp; to other ministers in their Consecration, by the outward
  sign of imposition of the Bishops hands, to exercise effectually the ministration of the
  Church, as in ministering of Sacraments, preaching and exercising of discipline. And
  whatsoever they do in the Church, according to the institution of Christ &amp; his Church,
  almighty God does ratify, accept, &amp; allow. Therefore all people of whatsoever degree,
  estate, or authority they be, ought to obey the Bishops &amp; Priests in causes
  Ecclesiastical. This is a power of the Church, given to them that be lawfully ordained
  &amp; consecrated, which power is not by laws of men, or of nature, but only of Christ
  above nature. (Con. Flo., Mat. 10. 3., Tit. 3., Act. 13.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the matter of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he matter is that thing, by delivering of which
  Order is given: as Priesthood is given or delivered by giving of the chalice and Paten
  with bread and wine. Deaconship is given by delivering of a book of the Gospels.
  Subdeaconship is given by the empty Chalice &amp; Paten. And in like manner the inferior
  Orders have some special matter appertaining to their Order: as the giving of the keys to
  the Ostiarie or Porter, and book to the Exorcist, the book of Psalms and Prophets to the
  Reader called Lector, the Candle &amp; Cruet to the Accolyte.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the form of this Sacrament?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he form is the words of Order, which the Bishop
  speaks: whereby an authority is given, to exercise some office in the Church, as in
  Priesthood the formal words be:</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Accipe potestatem offerendi Sacrificium, Missasque
  celebrandi, tam pro viuis, quam pro defunctis, in nomine Domini.</em></p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 68]</p>
  <p align="left"><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>By these words, the Bishop gives authority
  &amp; power to him that receives Priesthood, to offer Sacrifice, and to celebrate Mass
  both for them that be alive, &amp; for them that be dead, in the name of our Lord.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whosoever shall receive the Order of Priesthood, must by degrees
  receive six orders before of the Bishop: of the which Orders four be called Inferior
  Orders.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exorcists, which have authority given to them, to expel Devils from
  them that be possessed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ostiaries or Porters have authority, to keep the Church door, to expel
  the unworthy, and to let into the Church the faithful and worthy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Readers, called <em>Lectores</em>, have authority to read lessons and
  scriptures in the Church: whereby the understanding of the faithful people is lightened.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acolytes have authority to bear Cruets to the Altar with wine and
  water, and bear candles and tapers: wherewith the mind of the people may be kindled and
  stirred to devotion.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These four Orders have not continency so annexed unto them but that
  they may marry. Subdeacon, Deacon, and Priest, have Continency so annexed to their Orders,
  that them may not marry.<br>

  necessaries for ministration, and to assist the Priest in ministration.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deacon has authority given to him from God by the Bishop to read the
  Gospel, and to assist the Priest in ministration of the Sacraments, and other offices in
  the Church.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Priest has his hands sanctified and hallowed by the bishop to
  sanctify and bless. And authority is given from God by the Bishop to the Priest, to
  minister Sacraments, that is: Baptism, whereby people first enter into the Church of God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, if after Baptism any man fall into deadly sin, the</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the Priest has authority, to consecrate and minister the
  Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, the Priest has authority, to pray over the sick persons and
  to anoint them with Holy Oil in the name of God, to the remission of their sins, and to
  the salutation of the sick, according to Gods pleasure.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, the Priest has authority, to join those two persons together
  in matrimony, that Marry in Christ.</p>

  <p align="center">OF THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY<br>
  <em>What is Matrimony?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">M</font>atrimony, which is a sign of the conjunction of
  Christ, and the Church his Spouse, is a Sacrament, whereby man &amp; woman lawfully joined
  together in marriage, do enter into an undivided society of fellowship of life, and grace
  is given therein, both honestly and Christianly to procreate Children, &amp; to bring them
  up godly, and also to avoid filthy lust and incontinency.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is the efficient cause of Matrimony?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he efficient cause is, a mutual consent of the man
  and woman expressed by words of matrimony of the time present, when the man says: I take
  thee to my wife: and the woman says: I take thee to my husband. And therein ought of
  necessity to be the presence of witnesses, &amp; of congruity, the consent of friends.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether may a man put away his wife for any cause?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font> man may put away his wife for no cause, except for
  fornication only: &amp; if for that cause any be separated at bed, neither of them may
  marry any other, as long as both they live. For Matrimony is a perpetual bond of a lawful
  Contract or Marriage.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>At what age may marriage be made?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">S</font>pousage may be at seven years of age, but full
  consent in Marriage must not be, before the woman be twelve years of age, and the man
  fourteen years of age.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether does carnal copulation after Spousage or truthplight, make
  Matrimony.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>f carnal copulation follow the spousage or
  truthplight, with this mind to be one to the other, as man &amp; wife, it makes </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 72]</p>
  <p align="left">Matrimony: but if it be for the intent of fornication, it is no Matrimony.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If man and woman bind themselves by faith and truth, or by book oath,
  with mutual consent to marry either other in time to come: although thereby they be bound
  to marry, upon pain of setting themselves in a damnable state yet lacking the formal word
  of Matrimony, it is no Marriage.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If either of them marry any other after the former promise, they must
  so continue, &amp; and not be separated. For although they spake words of promising
  marriage in time to come, the words of the time present must take place.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If man &amp; woman with a mutual consent in heart, shall speak some
  words of the time to come, thinking thereby, that they be made man &amp; wife before God:
  it stands for Marriage, but not before man &amp; the Churches judgment, which must judge
  upon the words &amp; not upon the mind and intents: and if either of them marry any other,
  they live in adultery.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas holy church has ever destested &amp; forbidden privie
  contracts, yet when any such have been done with consent &amp; formal words, it has been
  marriage before God, whether they have had witness or not. Albeit this matter of privy
  Contracts, being thoroughly examined at the last general council held at Trent, the
  inconvenience that did arise thereof diligently weighed &amp; considered: for the better
  safeguard of the peoples consciences, &amp; avoiding contention, it was thought good to
  the holy Ghost and the Fathers assembled in the said general council, to make all privy
  contracts void and of no strength, except the contract be made in the presence of the
  priest and other witnesses: so that after the publication of the said general council, all
  such privie contracts without the witness of the priest &amp; others be void and of no
  effect, but that the parties so privily contracting may lawfully marry any other.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 73]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any man and woman speak the formal words of
  Matrimony for fear of their parents or friends, or for any evil purpose, without consent
  of heart: they be not man and wife before God. If either of them do use carnal copulation
  with other, that gave no consent in heart, they commit fornication, as long as he or she
  continue in the same mind: wherein the next remedy is, to give consent of heart to that
  which was spoken before in words, and so be they man and wife before God.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many things be required in Matrimony of necessity?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>wo things: consent of both their hearts and words,
  expressing the consent of both their minds.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also some things be required in Matrimony, that the ordinary for some
  necessary causes may dispense in: As that banes ought to be asked three solemn days before
  the time of marriage as the Ordinal does plainly appoint.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And certain time and days in the year, the ordinance of holy church
  does forbid marriage to be solemnized, that they may give themselves more conveniently to
  prayer, as the scripture does teach.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The times that the solemnization of Matrimony does cease in the
  Catholic church, is from the saturday next before Advent Sunday, until the Octave of the
  Epiphany: from the saturday next before Septuagesima Sunday, until the Octaves of Easter
  be past: that is to say, until the monday next after low Sunday: from the Sunday before
  the Rogation week, until Trinity Sunday.</p>

  <p align="center">THE FIFTH CHAPTER, OF THE OFFICES OF CHRISTIAN JUSTICE.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Sobri, pi &amp; just vivamus.<br>
  </em>Soberly, Godly, and justly let us live. (Tit. 2)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many offices of Christian justice be there?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>wo, the one is to decline from evil, the other is
  to do good. (Psal. 3., 1 Jo. 3., Isa. 1.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How can a man be able to perform these two offices of justice?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">H</font>e can not truly of himself, by being holpen by the
  grace of God, and instructed by the holy Ghost, a Christian man may and ought (as much as
  the state of this life does permit) to live justly and fulfil the law. (John 5., 2. Cor.
  3., Luke 1., Rom. 8., Tit. 3.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>By what degrees be we brought into sin?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">B</font>y suggestion of the Devil, delectation of the
  flesh, and consent of the mind. (Pro. 11., John 11.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Who be the most grievous sinners?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hey that sin willfully of mere malice. Also they,
  that do boast of their sin. Thirdly they, that with contentious words strive against them
  that give them good counsel, and utterly condemn the same. (Pro. 2.)</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 75]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Which be the sin so abominable that cry unto God in heaven for
  vengeance?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he scripture does make mention of four, that be
  most horrible and abominable in the sight of God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is, voluntary or willful man-slaughter. How the innocent
  blood of Abel cried from the earth to God, and how Cain was punished, it is evident. (Gen.
  4.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is Sodomitical sin, man with man, or woman with woman
  against nature. How the cry of this most abominable sin came to God from the earth: and
  how God poured down fire &amp; brimstone to destroy the wicked Sodomites, it appears plain
  in Scripture. (Gen. 18.) This terrible example puts in remembrance that perpetually to
  burn in hell with fire and brimstone, is a punishment due for them that commit sin against
  nature.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third is oppression of the poor, fatherless children and widows.
  How God punished Pharaoh and the Egyptians, for oppressing the Israelites, the scripture
  does show. Oppressors can not escape Gods vengeance.&nbsp; (Exo. 22.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth sin that cries to God for vengeance, is to keep back the
  wages of the hired servant or workman, when he has done his service or work. (Jacob. 5.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Whether is not sufficient for a christian man to do no evil?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>o do no evil is but the half part of christian
  justice. It is not sufficient for a Christian man, to do no evil (Psal. 36., Rom. 12.),
  but he is bound to do good: for as St. James says. (Jacob 4.) He that knows how to do
  good, &amp; and does it not, he does commit sin: and also the Gospel says every tree that
  does not bring forth good fruit, it shall be cut down and cast into the fire. (Mat. 3.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What kind of good works ought a Christian man to use?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>asting, almsdeeds, mercy and prayer. That prayer is
  good (says the scripture) that is joined with fasting &amp; almsdeeds.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 76]<a name="76"></a></p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is Fasting?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">F</font>asting is a foundation of virtue whereby vice &amp;
  sin is repressed, and mind is lifted up: the body is chastised, and the flesh is made
  subject to the spirit: obedience is exercised, and the grace of God obtained. By fasting
  the soul is nourished. ( Heiron.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manner of fasting is, certain days and times, according to the
  custom and precept of the church, to abstain from flesh, and to eat but one moderate meal
  in the day. The time of the lent is more straightly to be kept, then other times of
  fasting: by cause Lent has it for the institution of Christ. (Concil. Magt. c. 35.
  &amp;. Bracca. 8. capi. 9.)The sixth general council in the lent time does forbid to eat
  eggs, or cheese, except as necessity require, or dispensation be obtained. (Concil.
  Constantin. 3.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is prayer?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">P</font>rayer is a lifting up of the mind to God, whereby
  we desire, evil or adversity to be put away, or else we desire good things to ourselves or
  to others, or we do praise God. (Damas.)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What is almsdeeds or mercy?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t is a benefit, wherewith we help and succor the
  necessity or misery of others, for the honour of God, with a good affection and
  compassion.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How many kinds of alms or mercies be there?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>here be two kinds of alms or works of mercy: the
  one is called corporal, the other spiritual. (Mat. 25.) The works of mercy or pity
  corporal be seven. To feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to cloth the naked,
  to visit the prisoners and sick, to harbor the harborless, and bury the dead.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The works of mercy or pity spiritual be seven. (1. Thes. 5., Jacob 5.,
  Rom. 15., Matt. 6., &amp; 28.) Discretely to correct them that offend: to teach the
  ignorant, to give good counsel to them that have need: to pray unto God for the</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 77]</p>
  <p align="left">health of our neighbor: to comfort the comfortless: patiently to suffer
  injuries: to forgive offenses done against us.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God grant us to do, that we may live. And here now let us make an end.
  For after thou knowest once (Gentle Reader, or diligent learner) what you ought to
  believe, &amp; how you ought to live, which to points I have prosecuted in this short
  Catechism, what remains but to make an end? For the rest now: is to be committed unto your
  practice: that like as you know through my simple and plain instruction what is to be
  done: so study and labour to exemplify &amp; show in your conversation that which you
  know. Especially, whereas I now have no more to say unto them, and God will begin to have
  a saying unto thee, except you keep his laws and Commandments. For when the Son of man
  shall come in his Majesty and all his Angels with him, than shall he sit upon the seat of
  his Majesty (Matt. 15), and all nations shall be gathered together before him et cet. the
  wicked shall go into everlasting punishment, and the just into life everlasting. Be
  faithful therefore in all articles that are to be believed, be devout in thy prayers, be
  loving and obedient as touching the Commandments of God and his Church, be wise in
  receiving the Sacraments, &amp; make not light of the remedies of thy sins and
  infirmities. Be diligent in the works of mercy, and take in good part this my small labor,
  which, I trust, shall bring great profit unto thee, and God grant it may be so great, as I
  have and shall wish it to be. Amen.</p>

  <p align="center">TO THE READER, CONCERNING <br>
  THE HOLY CEREMONIES OF <br>
  GODS CHURCH</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">M</font>any wise and learned men have thought it good that
  I should join to the Catechism (which I did lately set forth for the instruction of young
  children in matters of faith) a brief declaration of certain Ceremonies whose
  signification is not so well known to the ignorant people as they should be.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore first to be known, that no company of men can meet
  together in one mind and consent of heart, for the true service of God, except they have
  certain holy signs, whereby both their worship towards God may be stirred up, and the
  profession thereof towards their neighbors may be seen. And thereupon as well in the law
  of the Jews as of the Christians, holy signs and Ceremonies have been always in use, by
  the appointment of God himself, or of his Prophets and Apostles. But for so much as the
  state of the Jews did bear outwardly a form and show of serving God rather like children,
  the like men, yea rather in a bound, then in a free sort: their Ceremonies were in a
  manner all expressly named in the Law like unto them, because it was presupposed, that
  they of themselves were not able to judge, what was convenient for this or that Sacrifice,
  or else for this or for that time, unless it were by their master and Lawmaker namely
  prescribed &amp; appointed.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 79]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for so much as the state of the New Testament is
  free, as wherein men of all nations are taught of God himself, &amp; are anointed inwardly
  with the Holy Ghost, having the law, not of Moses, but of God written in their hearts and
  bowels (as the Prophets and Apostles do witness) therefore (the holy Sacraments <em>being
  made and instituted of Christ himself</em>) most of the other ceremonies were left to the
  discretion of the Apostles &amp; their successors. For which cause S. Peter with the rest
  of the Apostles &amp; Priests at Jerusalem ordained &amp; decreed, what was to be observed
  of the Gentiles, who were newly converted to the faith. And S. Paul having declared, what
  he received of Christ touching the Sacrament of the Altar, adds of his own authority: <em>Caetera
  cum venero. disponam. </em>The rest I will set in order, when I shall come. (Isa 54, John
  6, 1 John 2, Jere 31, Heb 8 &amp;10, 2 Cor. 3)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon which words of S. Paul (1 Cor. 11), the great Clerk S. Augustine
  writes thus: <em>Apostolus de hoc Sacramento loquens, ait: Caetera cum venero, ordinabo.
  Vnde intelligi datur, quia multum erat, vt in epistola totu illum agendi ordinem
  insinuaret. quem unviuersa per orbem seruat Ecclesia, ab ipso ordinatum esse, quod nulla
  morum diuersitate variatur. </em>(Aug. in epi. 118) The Apostle speaking of this
  sacrament, saith: <em>The rest I will set in order, when I shall come. </em>(1 Cor. 2)
  Where upon it is given us to understand (because it was much) or hard (to touch in an
  epistle the whole order in doing, which the whole church throughout the whole world does
  observe) that thing which is varied with no diversity of customs to have been ordained by
  the Apostle Saint Paul. Mark what S. Augustine saith, Wherein so ever all churches agree
  in celebrating Mass, that thing he doubts not, to have been ordained, of S. Paul. Of this
  kind are holy Altars, secret praying at certain times of the Mass, </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 80]</p>
  <p align="left">praying for the living, &amp; for the faithful souls departed, the use of
  receiving the blessed Sacrament in the morning, or fasting: with many other like
  ceremonies. Which all churches in all countries have always used. And that which is namely
  said of the ceremonies belonging to the chief Sacrament, is likewise to be understood of
  all other Sacraments. For the Apostle said generally: <em>State &amp; tenete traditions,
  quas didicitis siue per sermone, siue per epistola nostra Stad steddie</em>, &amp; keep ye
  the traditions which ye have learned either by our talk, or by our letters (2 Thess 2):
  &amp; S. Augustine says likewise generally. <em>Quoe no scripta, sed tradita custodimus,
  &amp;c </em>(In ep. 118)<em>. </em>Those things which we keep, not being written, but
  being delivered, which at the least are observed throughout the whole world, and are
  understanded to be kept by the commending and decreeing of the Apostles themselves, or
  else of the general councils whose authority is most wholesome in the church. As that the
  Passion of our Lord, and Resurrection, and ascension into heaven, and the coming from
  heaven of the holy Ghost are solely kept every year: and so of any other thing, which is
  kept in every place where the Church spreads itself.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It were easy to show, that many other ancient Fathers do speak in like
  sort of our holy Ceremonies, were it not above the measure of a brief Catechism, to stand
  about that matter any longer. Therefore now I will talk more particularly of certain
  special Ceremonies, and the meaning thereof.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 81]<a name="81"></a></p>
  <p align="center">THE USE AND MEANING OF THE HOLY<br>
  CEREMONIES OF GODS CHURCH</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why is holy water used in the Church?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t is used, to put men in mind of the water of
  Baptism, wherein their sins were cleansed, through the name of the blessed Trinity called
  upon them, and through their own or the Churches faith. (Tit 3, Matt 28) And therefore as
  men by the water of Baptism entered into the Church, which is the mystical body of Christ:
  so at the entering into the material church, they sprinkled themselves with holy water.
  For albeit the Baptism it self can not be repeated, yet the remembrance thereof is most
  laudably preserved in all good Christians.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How old is the use of Holy Water?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t came even from the Apostles, as it may be
  thought. For mention thereof is made in the Epistle of <em>Pope Alexander. </em>Who was
  the fifth Bishop of Rome after saint Peter.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Can holy water drive away the Devils?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">N</font>ot only holy water, but many other holy things are
  of power to drive away Devils from their bodies or places, who use them in a right faith.
  For, as through our sins the devil has power to use, not only his own malice, but also
  Gods creatures to our hurt: even so faithful men take power of Christ, not only to resist
  the devil by their own faith, but also by the creatures, <em>which are sanctified by Gods
  word &amp; prayer. </em>(1 Tim 4) And so does Theodoretus an ancient writer of the
  Ecclesiastical history witness, that devils were cast out in the old time. (Eccles.
  Histor. Libr. 5. cap. 21) For where as the devil stayed the fire that could have no
  strength in burning</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 82]</p>
  <p align="left">of an Idols temple, Marcellus the Bishop of Apamea caused his Deacon
  Equitius to bring water in a vessel, which being set under the holy Altar, the Bishop
  prayed, &amp; when he had made the sign of the Cross upon the water, he willed his
  faithful Deacon to sprinkle the said water upon the flame, <em>quo facto contactus aquoe
  impatien doemon aufegit. </em>Which being done, the devil not being able to abide that the
  water should touch him, fled away. And verily whosoever now a days can not abide to have
  holy-water sprinkled upon him, he may well be suspect, that a devil has power on him, who
  is afraid of the said holy water, and therefore keeps his servant from it as far as he
  can. Thus we see both the profit, and the antiquity of holy water.<br>
  <a name="82"></a></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why is sensing used?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">I</font>t betokens, that as the sweet perfume of
  frankincense ascends up into the air: so our prayers ought to be directed as a sweet smell
  in the sight of God. And as the Angel taught Tobias, to drive away the devil by kindling
  of the liver of the fish: even so like kindling of frankincense with the like faith and
  devotion, does help to drive away the devil, &amp; to defend the faithful people from his
  injuries and assaults. (Psal. 146, Tob. 6)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>How long has sensing been used?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">E</font>ven from the Apostles time as it may appear by the
  words of <em>Dionysius the Areopagite</em>, in his book of the holy order &amp; government
  of the Church, where he expressly names that ceremony (Dionysius. Ecclesi. Hierarc. cap.
  3.). In the solemn Mass also of S. James, and Chrisostom it was used.<br>
  <a name="82a"></a></p>
  <p align="center"><em>What means Procession?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">P</font>rocession was ordained, partly to protest and to
  show everywhere by our deeds the Christian faith (as by carrying openly</p>

  betoken, that even as we go out of the Church, and after a pilgrimage make come into it

  Mary, did after his peregrination made in this world return to his Father again whither

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, that as the candle being one kind of creature consists of
  fire, wax, and wick: so Christ consists of the Godhead, soul, &amp; flesh, all being in
  one person. Therefore on Candlemass day by carrying a holy candle, we to well represent
  our Lady carrying Christ to the Temple in her arms. (Luke 21)<br>

  Christ said: Except ye do penance, ye shall all perish. (Matt. 5, John 3, Luke 13)</p>

  the free grace of the Prophets needed the said fast of forty days: and we are now in a
  prophetical state, seeing it is written of our time, that God will pour his spirit upon
  every flesh (or nation) &amp; that all men shall be taught of God, as in the old time the

  great labor, or sickness be excused, they ought to take but one meal on a fasting day,</p>

  eat nothing at all: so in them who can not bear such an abstinence, it is permitted to
  make one meal. (August. epist. 86) As for drinkings at night, or eating any other thing
  (which yet may not be a meal) so that no fraud be used: it is sufficient to keep the
  custom which is allowed by the lawful Bishop of the Church wherein we live. (Augu. in epi.

  <p align="left"><font size="5">A</font>s holy Images are set up in Gods church at other
  times to represent unto us, that the saints reign with God in heaven: so in the Lent they
  are covered &amp; kept from our sights, to betoken, that sins and iniquities (for which we
  then do penance) divide between God and us: hiding his face &amp; glory from us, even as
  the veil hid Moses face from the hard hearted Jews. And therefore when the good Christian
  looks up, and sees not the glorious representation of heavenly joy, which in the church,
  was wont by his eye to come to his mind, he has warning thereby, to cry out: woe to me: My
  sins have hidden gods glory from me, except by his grace I may come to true repentance,
  &amp; to do penance for them. And so he is warned, to call unto God for true contrition,
  sacramental confession, and temporal satisfaction. (Isa. 5:4, Exo. 34, 2 Cor. 3, Isa. 59,

  Basil confessed that the custom to bless the water of Baptism came from an unwritten
  tradition. (Basil de spiritu sa. cap. 27) The feasts of Easter and Whitsunday are chosen
  for the purpose, because in the one Christ after death rose out of his grave: in the other
  he sent down the holy Ghost. Now in Baptism (as S. Paul says) we are buried with Christ,
  and rise again to walk with him in a new life, &amp; the sanctification of the new man,
  which we take and bear, is wrought in Baptism first of all by the holy Ghost. (1 Cor 15,

  farther of, because they know them to be the signs, and as it were the trumpets calling
  the faithful soldiers to hear Gods word, and to make common prayer.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why is the Church hallowed?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">B</font>ecause it bears a figure of the lively members of
  Christ, which is holy and unspotted in her faith &amp; religion. Item to cause the men who
  come thither, to be the more stirred to prayer, &amp; to the sooner heard in a holy place,
  as it may well appear, that the holy Ghost taught us to believe by the dedication of
  Solomons temple: where a special grace is desired for them, who pray in the temple
  dedicated to Gods holy name. (1 Pet. 2, Ephe. 5, 3 Reg. 8)<br>
  <a name="88"></a></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Why is the Altar consecrated?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>hat the chief protestation &amp; showing of
  external religion (which is external sacrifice) may be offered upon a most solemn &amp;
  reverend place. For although the whole Church be generally hallowed: yet the Altar being
  within the same Church, has a most special sanctification, as which bears that room in our
  holy doings, which the Cross itself bare, when Christ died upon it (3 Reg. 8). And seeing
  Noah built an Altar and Abraham is noted not only to have offered up his son (Gen. 3 &amp;
  22, Jacob. 2), but also to have done it upon the Altar: seeing also that in the tabernacle
  of Moses, and the temple of Solomon the Altar was so holy, that (as our Saviour him self
  saith) it sanctified and made holy the gift which was laid upon it (Matt 23): by the same
  reason our Altars should much more be hallowed, as which contain that body upon them, for
  whose sake all Altars were hallowed, &amp; all Sacrifices were made. Wherefore, <em>Optatus</em>.
  An ancient writer (Contra Paramenianum lib. 6) speaking against the Donatists who in his
  time destroyed the holy Altars of the Catholics, said: <em>Quid est enim Altare, nisi
  sedes corporis</em></p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 89]</p>
  <p align="left"><em>&amp; sanguinis Christi? </em>For what is the Altar, but the seat of
  the body and blood of Christ? That is to say, the place where Christs body and blood does
  remain, during the time of the unbloody Sacrifice.<br>
  <a name="89"></a></p>
  <p align="center"><em>What do the Altar clothes signify?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">V</font>erily they represent the Good affection, which
  faithful people have to honor the place of Christs residence. For as the Apostles being
  commanded to bring the ass unto Christ (Matt. 21), did upon their own Good affection cast
  their clothes upon the Ass, to the end Christs seat might be made the more honorable: so
  do the faithful followers of the Apostles deck and set forth the place where christ in a
  mystery presents himself unto us. And therefore S. Hierome praises Nepotianus, for
  providing carefully, that the Altar might be neat and clean. <em>Erat solicitus si niteret
  altare, si parietes absque fuliqine, si pauimenta tersa, si ianitor creber in porta, vela
  semper in ostiis, si sacrificium mundum, si vasa luculenta, &amp; in omnes ceremonias pia
  solicitudo disposita. </em>(Ad Heliod de epitaph. Nepotiani)<em> </em>He was careful to
  see, that the Altar might shine, that the walls might be without the smoke and the tapers
  or lamps, that the pavements might be neat, that the porter might be often at the Church
  door, that the clothes might always cover the doors, that the Vestry might be clean, that
  the vessels might be bright, &amp; that his godly carefulness might be well disposed
  toward all the Ceremonies.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>What means the apparel which the Priest wears at Mass?</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he Amice, which the Priest first puts on his head,
  does signify the cloth, wherewith Christs face was covered whilst the Jews buffeted him,
  saying: Areade, who did strike thee? (Matt. 26)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Albe, which is a long white garment, represents the</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 90]</p>
  <p align="left">white coat, wherewith Herod did send Christ back to Pilate, reputing him
  as a fool.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Girdle betokens the scourge wherewith Christ was whipped. And the
  Fauell, which the Priest puts on his left arm, betokens the cord wherewith they bound
  Christ, when they first took him. As also the Stole represents the other ropes, wherewith
  they bound him to the Pillar while they whipped him. (John 19, 18)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The upper vestment does betoken the purple garment, wherewith Christ
  was clothed in derision, when they saluted him king of the Jews. (John 19) Thus the priest
  going to make the sacrifice of the church which it learned of Christ, does in outward
  signs set before our eyes the history of Christs Passion, which is the true pattern of all
  sacrifices. (Cyprian lib. 2. epist. 3)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Priest then being so clothed sets briefly before us all the life of
  Christ, but most specially of all the circumstances of his death. He comes therefore from
  the vestry to the Altar, as it were showing, how Christ came from heaven into this world.
  He begins the Mass with some part of a Psalm, which he repeats twice or thrice, in showing
  the Prophets &amp; Patriarchs to have prayed for, &amp; to have rejoiced at the day of
  Christs incarnation, which they saw in spirit.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He cries out for mercy nine times, giving us to understand, that his
  Sacrifice depends upon Christ, and not upon our merits. (John 8) He begins the <em>Gloria
  in excelsis Deo</em>, Glory in the highest unto God, putting us in mind of the hymn and
  praise, which the Angels sang at christs birth. And therewith he said. The lord be with
  you: which is no more but the prophetical naming of Christ who is called Emanuel, that is
  to say, the Lord with us. The collect signifies, the whole church with one accord to have
  prayed for the coming of our Saviour, and by him only to trust for salvation. The epistle
  does resemble the preaching of S. John</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 91]</p>
  <p align="left">Baptist. The mourning song of the Grail shows that penance with insued
  among the good men upon S. John Baptists preaching. (Matt 3) The joyful song Alleluya
  betokens the spiritual joy, which after their penance done they obtained, partly in this
  life, and specially in the life to come: for those who mourn in God, shall be comforted.
  (Matt 5) The Gospel betokens the preaching of Christ. The creed witnesses, what great
  fruit of professing the true faith insued upon Christs preaching, which is not only showed
  by words, but also by works: while the devout persons offer unto God before the Altar,
  some of their temporal goods &amp; substance, either to be consecrated unto God (as bread
  and wine) or to be distributed to the poor, or else to be employed to the use of the
  church, as wax and oil. At the length the Catecumens and learners of the faith being
  removed out of the Church, the Christians proper sacrifice is begun. At which neither
  novices in faith, nor infidels may be present: because it is most subject to the derision
  of the wicked.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bread and wine then is brought to the Priest at the Altar, to the end
  he may do with them as Christ in his last supper did, when he was now going to his death.
  The Chalice betokens the grave: the white corporace betokens the white sheet, wherein
  Joseph did fold Christs body, when it was laid into the grave: &amp; the paten represents
  the stone wherewith the grave was covered. But because all this is done only to bring
  Christs death unto our remembrance, &amp; not to bury Christ again, therefore the priest
  after Secret prayer (which Christ also used in the garden before his Passion - Matt 26)
  crieth: lift up your hearts: and again: thanks unto our Lord God, who has both redeemed us
  &amp; left us these mysteries of his glorious death, resurrection, &amp; ascension. After
  which praises &amp; thanksgiving by the Priest, all the people, or such as supply their
  place, do sing in the honor of the blessed Trinity three times, Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord
  God of hosts, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, Osanna in the highest.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 91]</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Priest now entering into the most holy meditations
  of Christs death, commends to god the whole Church dispersed throughout the whole world,
  &amp; those by name for whom he is bound to pray, as the Pope, the Bishop, the King, &amp;
  his own friends. (1 Tim 2) And because this is the common sacrifice of all the church, he
  reverently makes mention on the blessed saints which reign with Christ, and desires to be
  holpen by their prayers, whom he doubts not to hear him, because they live with Christ,
  and in him see our necessities, when we call to them, much the better then the Prophets
  save their hearts, who came unto them for aid or succor. (Phili. 1, 1. Reg. 9, 3. Reg. 5)
  And being thus provided he making many times the sign of the holy Cross, to betoken, that
  all the virtue and power he has, is taken by Christs death and Passion, comes at last to
  take Christs person, upon him, saying in his name and power over the bread. This is my
  body and over the wine. This is my blood &amp;c. (Matt. 26) By which words no faithful man
  doubts, but that Christs body and blood are made really present under the form of bread
  and wine. In token of which belief the priest lifts up the holy Sacrament, to put us in
  remembrance, how Christ was exalted upon the Cross for us, and the people adore with godly
  honor the self body and blood, which died, and was shed for us. And then in words also the
  Priest beseeches, the said body and blood of Christ being most acceptable to God, in his
  own nature, to be accepted also of God in respect of the Church, which being yet sinful,
  adventures to handle and to offer such precious gifts. And then the faithful souls are
  commended also unto God, to the end no members of the Church may be omitted of the Church
  in the common sacrifice which touches the whole body of the Church. And all this holy
  secret action is ended with the open pronouncing of our Lords prayer by the seven
  petitions, whereof we may cal to mind the seven words or sayings</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 93]</p>
  <p align="left">which our Lord pronounced alone upon the Cross, over and besides these
  secret prayers, wherein he commends to his father all the Patriarchs, Prophets, just men,
  and all that ever shall be saved, whether they were then born or no: for signification of
  the which diverse state in the church, for all whom Christs body was broken and vexed upon
  the cross, the B. Sacrament of the Altar is broken into three parts, and the kiss of peace
  being sent to the faithful that are present (while they cal for mercy and peace at the
  hands of the Lamb of God) the whole Sacrifice is received either by the priest alone, if
  none other be prepared there unto (as Christ upon the Cross ended his own Sacrifice alone)
  or if others be ready, they receive also with the priest even as Christ at his supper gave
  his Sacrament, <em>Passio est Domini sacrificium quod offerimus</em>. (Lib. 1. pist. 3)
  The sacrifice which we offer, is the Passion of our Lord: that is to say, the substance
  which we offer, is the same, which suffered and rose again from death.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And therefore although Christ made the sacrifice of his supper at the
  evening, to declare, that as well the old Sacraments, as the world itself were now come to
  their later end: yet we offer in the morning, to show, that we take hold of Christs
  resurrection also, &amp; live now in a new state of grace.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in deed the very receiving and consuming of the Sacrament by the
  faithful is a resemblance also of Christs Ascension, wherein he was taken from our sight
  into the heavens, whence he sent the holy Ghost, even as the Priest (having now ended the
  mysteries with the Collet of thanksgiving) blesses the people, and departs into the vestry
  when he first came forth. Thus are the Obsecrations, the Orations, the Postulations and
  the giving of thanks made, whereof S. Paul wrote unto Timothy. (1 Tim. 2) And that
  according to the mind of S. Augustin, who</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 94]</p>
  <p align="left">there in treating upon the word <em>Oratio</em> (which in Greek signified <em>Votum
  </em>a vow) doubts not to say, <em>Vouenter omnia quoe offerentur Deo, maxime Sancti
  Altaris Obatio. </em>(August. epi. 56)<em> </em>All things are vowed which are offered
  unto God, especially the Oblation of the holy Altar: Where he names the Sacrament of
  Christs supper, the Oblation of the Altar, and expressly teaches it to be offered and
  vowed unto God. Unto God, I say, and not (as the Protestants teach) either by the people
  only to the Priest, or by the Priest only to the people. But he says, <em>Sancti Altaris
  oblatio maxime offertur Deo. </em>The oblation or offering of the holy Altar, is most of
  all offered unto God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may suffice for a brief instruction of the youth, concerning the
  most notable and daily Ceremonies of the church, which who so despiseth, he therein
  despiseth the whole company of Christians, who from the Apostles time till this hour, have
  used the said Ceremonies at the Service of God, as whereby the mind is provoked to think
  of God, and of the holy saints much more reverently, then otherwise it would. God give
  every man grace, not to be wise more than he ought, but to be humble, and rather to seek
  what an unknown Ceremony means, then to laugh at that which he knows not. For he that by
  such contempt is ignorant, shall not be known of God, as the Apostles threaten. And he
  that seeks as he ought, shall find, as our Saviour himself has said. (Rom. 12, 1 Cor. 41,
  Luke 1)</p>

  <p align="left"><em><font size="5">F</font>our strong reasons Why a man ought to forsake
  all new doctrines, and constantly to cleave to the ancient Religion and doctrine,
  universally and openly professed in England, by all the ancient Kings and people of this
  Land, ever since the first receiving of Christian Religion there.</em></p>
  <p align="left">Whereas the holy scripture admonishes us to be constant in faith, and not
  wavering, or yet light in belief: These reasons following inform us, that we cannot
  observe this said admonition if we forsake the said ancient Religion &amp; doctrine, and
  lean to any other. (Gal. 19, John 4, Matt. 24)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First the said ancient Religion and doctrine is an approved and surely
  grounded religion and doctrine: for it is the very same which the first preachers of
  Christian faith in England did there plant: And the very same which the most ancient
  Fathers of virtuous life and excellent learning, from age to age in all Christian Regions,
  from Christ till this day have holden and followed: and therefore by a good consequence,
  it is the Religion &amp; doctrine of the Catholic church, which all the people are bound
  to follow. (Mat. 18, Matt. 24, 1 Tim. 3, 1 Tim. 4, 1 Cor. 11) And on the other side, most
  part of the new doctrines</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 96]</p>
  <p align="left">are of late foundation: devised, set up &amp; advanced in these later
  days: &amp; therefore in that point are to be holden as suspected, &amp; to be taken heed
  of, as we are admonished. (1 Tim. 4, 2 Tim. 3&amp;4) Many of them are old heresies new
  scoured, and many years before condemned: and therefore they bring sufficient matter to
  suspect their favorers in all the rest. And they are also so opposite and repugnant to all
  the said ancient Religion in so many several points, as if all our ancestors had lived
  ever in misbelief, and as if true faith had never been published, or at least securely
  defended till this day, which to affirm, were not only to accuse Christ of breach of
  promise, and to deny the providence of the holy ghost in governing the Church, but also
  absurd and against common sense. (Matt. 16, John 14,-16, Luke 11, 2 Tim. 3)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly the Authors &amp; beginners of the new doctrines were and are
  infamous persons, and detected of horrible crimes, as well before as after there
  publishing of there doctrines: In so much as if the world had been universally in
  misbelief until there times (as most untruly &amp; absurdly they pretend) yet is it not
  probable, that God would use any such wicked instruments in so great a cause: neither is
  there any example that ever he did the like: but the contrary. And as for the first
  preachers of the said ancient Religion in England what they were in life &amp;
  conversation, all ancient Histories bear witness &amp; their works &amp; monuments yet
  remaining do testify, so as this one comparison may suffice for a testimony against the
  new gospellers either to condemn them clearly or at least to hold them for suspected.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly the new doctrines being repugnant in themselves, &amp;
  disagreeing in the chief points of Religion, are without rest &amp; unity of spirit: which
  defect argues their untruth. But his is not to be found in the said ancient Religion and
  doctrine. (Rom. 12, 2 Cor. 1, Heb. 4, Ephe. 4, Phil. 2).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, the new doctrines do deprave virginity, abstinence, austerity
  of life, &amp; Christian discipline, and favors liberty so</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 97]</p>
  <p align="left">much, as they give occasion of licentious and dissolute living: and have
  the marks which the scripture gives of the doctrine of Antichrist: So as the wicked
  conversation of many of the professors and favorers thereof, appears evidently to be the
  mere fruits of their doctrine: a special note to detect all sects &amp; sectaries. (2 Pet.
  2, 1 John 2, Ep. Jud.)<br>
  <a name="97"></a></p>
  <p align="center">HERE FOLLOWS CERTAIN DEGREES TO<br>
  VIRTUE PROPERLY CALLED:<br>
  <small>A LADDER OF SIX STEPS TOWARDS HEAVEN.</small></p>
  <p align="center"><em>Diligent Examination.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he first degree is diligently to search &amp;
  examine himself. Every person ought to speak and confer daily with his inward man or soul
  before he go to bed saying thus. Oh my soul how much &amp; in what manner have I this day
  erred &amp; strayed or loitered from a spiritual or celestial life, how much of this day
  have I spent in true devotion or exercise of virtue, what kind of thing have I done, said,
  or thought, for or against my souls health. This first rule or degree is found in diverse
  places of holy scripture, as when the prophet said, I have nightly meditated with my heart
  and used groaning in my spirit, he said also in another place I have labored sore in my
  sightings, I will every night wash my bed and sprinkle my conche with trares, &amp; the
  king Ezechias said, I will bring to thy remembrance. O Lord God all my years in bitterness
  and anguish of any soul or of my life. (Isa 38)</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Detestation.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he second degree is detestation. I behooves that
  when any person by this diligent examination have found his conscience loaded or charged
  with sin, then to detest and hate it for the love of god (to whom all sin is contrary
  &amp; displeasing) &amp; for no other thing.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 98]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Purpose of Amendment.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he third degree is full of purpose to amend. After
  sin be detested must follow to intend &amp; endeavour to do good, for to have at the least
  some beginning of the two parts of Christian Justice, which are to decline from evil &amp;
  do good, which is at large defined in the fifth chapter of this present book, entreating
  of the office of Christian Justice: For he is unhappy, wicked, and void of understanding,
  that will not (at the least) purpose &amp; determine every day betwixt God and himself, to
  do better in time to come. And this is to present himself to the grace of God, of the
  which the prophet speaks. <em>Quare tristis es anima mea &amp; quare coturbas me, et ce. </em>Wherefore
  art thou heavy my soul and wherefore doest thou trouble me, trust in God for yet will I
  confess the praises of him. It is to be understanded by these praises, the Good life we
  lead.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Prayer.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he fourth degree is prayer, After having purposed
  well &amp; virtuously to live, It behooves to do all by humble, devout and perseverant
  prayer to then we may have help &amp; assistance of god. For without him we can not enter
  into any step of virtue and therefore we ought every day humbly to pray unto God saying. O
  most sovereign Lord &amp; God which by thy benign grace exhorts us by thy holy scripture
  to trust &amp; put our refuge in thee by prayers, for that thou art almighty &amp;
  vigilant: &amp; incline by divinity bounty to our feebleness we bring thy work and poor
  creatures. Now then for the love of thee I renounce all worldly vanities &amp; sensuality.
  And desire to live well and virtuously in keeping thy commandments. Confirm therefore my
  desire by thy holy spirit and finally give me such virtues as are to me necessary to bring
  me to thee where is all</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 99]</p>
  <p align="left">glory, beatitude and felicity to all Just. And thou blessed virgin Mary
  and all the Saints of heaven, it is to you to whom I lift up mine eyes, to the end that by
  your merits and prayers I may obtain that which my merits could never obtain.</p>
  <p align="left">O Jesus fountain of all secretness pardon me that I have not until this
  present sufficiently known thy incomprehensible secretness, neither have I forced myself
  anything to get at the least, any taste thereof making small accompte to beautify my soul
  or to relieve her, nor of the union betwixt her and thy holy spirit. O how little have I
  drawn myself to spiritual things and so prepare my heart to receive thee and to be Joyful
  with thee and to make a chamber in me in the which thou had long time and often made thy
  dwelling.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas my most loyal and true lover pardon me that I have not always
  sought &amp; obeyed according to thy holy will, that I have not esteemed thy friendship
  for my sovereign wealth: but the contrary have as the prodigal child long time served
  swine &amp; have satisfied myself with their meat, that is to say with vain and wicked
  delights and pleasures of this world beseeching thee therefore, to forgive me and to have
  begun so late to know thee, and that I have not before this time endeavored myself to run
  after the secret odor of thy ointments, that is to say after thy virtues and thy divine
  grace. I beseech thee withdraw not thy right hand from me, and disdain not to succour him
  which comes though something late: but rather awake me &amp; draw me more strongly because
  I come so late (for the most part of my days are past over) to the end I may in running
  hastily to thee, recover the time past which I lost, &amp; that the hour of death overtake
  me not before I have taken such state of life as always I ought to purpose and pretend,
  that is to say a perfect union of my soul &amp; thy holy spirit through pure &amp; true
  continual love. Amen.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 100]</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Execution of works.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he fifth degree is execution of works. In this
  point we fail commonly all, for we purpose &amp; pray sometimes enough, but we never come
  to this degree to work the said purpose which appertains to a virtuous life. It behooves
  then, that person that tends to perfection (when he rises in the morning) to say in his
  heart. I see &amp; consider well that it behooves me to use such and such virtue &amp;
  therefore this day without any longer delay, I will put in execution the same work, &amp;
  then he ought effectually &amp; constantly to begin.</p>
  <p align="center"><em>Perseverance in virtue.</em></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he sixth degree is perseverance in virtue. It is
  necessary also to ascend up to this degree (those that will come to a heavenly and godly
  life) and not to rest &amp; faint in the way: for it may so happen that some having served
  God and lived virtuously for the space of 16. or 20, years, after by little and little
  shall wax weary and negligent, leaving of his virtuous exercises and God also begin to
  forsake him, for if God abandon or forsake any, the devil presently takes possession to
  denounce him, to make him forget his former good life, and to live wickedly in all vice
  and sin: of this speaks the prophet David saying (<em>Deus dereliquu eum, persequemini
  &amp; comprehendite eum quia non est qui eripiat) God hath forsaken him, pursue him and
  apprehend him for there is none that will deliver him. </em>These are the words of the
  wicked and reproved spirits, destroyers of souls in speaking one to another. Alas it is
  marvelously lamentable when it thus happens &amp; therefore we ought most humbly and often
  pray unto God with the prophet Daniel saying (<em>Ne derelinquas me domine deus neus,
  nequando rapiat, &amp; non sit qui eripiat</em>) <em>forsake me not my Lord &amp; God,
  depart not from me lest the devil come to denounce me &amp; none be that can deliver me. </em>God
  through his grace grant us this request. Amen.</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 101]<a name="101"></a></p>
  <p align="center">A BRIEF MEDITATION OR RATHER FORM OF EXAMINATION<br>
  OF ONES CONSCIENCE DAILY TO BE USED TO BEDWARD<br>
  WHEREIN IS CONTAINED A RIGHT PRACTICE OF<br>
  THE FORMER SIX STEPS.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he first point is to give God thanks for his
  benefits received, with this or such like prayer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bless our Lord God (O my soul) &amp; all that is within me bless him.
  Give thanks to God (my soul) for all his benefits given to me, &amp; see thou never forget
  them. To thee O Lord be all thanks, glory &amp; honour for ever more. Amen.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he next point is to desire God his grace for to
  know your sins, and to expel the same with this or such like prayer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O Lord show to me thy ways and teach me thy foot-paths: Pour into my
  heart O Lord the grace of thy holy spirit, and lighten my understanding, that I may
  thoroughly perceive and see all my sins before my eyes, and by thy gracious aid expel the
  same from time to time till my lives end, good Lord I beseech thee.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he third point is to call your soul to an account
  for all your sins that day committed, (beginning in the morning at your first waking, and
  so from hour to hour till the time of this meditation) in thought, word, deed and
  omission: and to this shall help you, if you call to remembrance, what matters you have
  been occupied withall, and with what persons: &amp; how much time you spent therein: And
  first examine your thoughts.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With what idle and unfruitful cogitations you passed this time or that
  time of the day, if your mind has been upon worldly things more than need were, or in the
  time of prayer: or if you have been over careful of your estate, lest by loss of this or
  that</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 102]</p>
  <p align="left">friend you should want: or have had any thought to suspect or misjudge
  wrongfully: or motion to mistrust Gods help, by thinking to much of the loss of any friend
  or worldly thing, or have had any murmuring against God anyway, &amp; how far you waded in
  any thought &amp; whether you gave any consent to your remembrance, or if you have felt
  any fleshly motions, or any carnal delectations, and whether they came in your mind, so as
  you passed them without consent or without strife to your remembrance or no. Or whether
  you have had mind to revenge wrongs, or if you have had any thoughts of pusillanimity or
  discouragement in godly exercise, which is a spice of sloth: As when the devil does
  suggest you think any evil of God or exercise of virtue, or of weariness of the world,
  otherwise then for hate of sin, or for love to be with God. Or if any thoughts have drawn
  you from serving of God, in prayers, or at Mass, or in saying penance enjoined, or in
  receiving the Sacrament: or what other vain thought has troubled you.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then examine your self for words: what superfluous talk for
  recreations sake have you used: if you have opened any secret faults of others: or have
  spoken to the reproach of others anything true or false: or justly have provoked others to
  anger by talk or hasty speech: or by filthy speech have given to others occasion of sin:
  or have sworn vainly: or have spoken untruths: And ever foresee that you stand in doubt of
  your own words, though you remember no ill words to have escaped you. And even so for your
  works: whether you have done any works of charity with pure intent, without vain glory or
  hypocrisy. And here think of Pride, Envy, wrath, Sloth, Covetousness, Gluttony and
  Lechery, how you have actually offended in any of them. If you have not loved God so
  earnestly as you should: if you have desired any mans death, or killed any man in his good
  fame: if you have left anything undone which you ought to</p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 103]</p>
  <p align="left">have done according to your ability touching the work of mercy, or deeds
  of Charity. And ever suspect your doings in everything: though you remember not any evil
  done that day. And this examination daily done, will make you more ready for your
  sacramental confession, &amp; help you in many things.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">T</font>he fourth point is with a short confession to ask
  forgiveness to this effect or like.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I confess to thee (O God almighty maker of heaven &amp; earth) all my
  sins, whatsoever they be which I have committed from my infancy to this present time
  wittingly or ignorantly, and specially those which this day I have committed in thought
  word or deed against thy divine will. And I most humbly crave pardon of thee, for my sins
  be Innumerable, mercy Lord mercy I most humbly beseech thee.</p>
  <p align="left">The fifth point is to purpose with god his grace to amend your life, and
  say Pater noster. Ave Maria. Kindle in me (O Lord) the fire of thy love, and grant me
  fruitful amendment of my life I beseech thee. Amen.</p>

  <p align="left">[pg. 104]<a name="104"></a></p>
  <p align="center">A NOTE OF SUCH THINGS AS ARE REPRESENTED TO<br>
  CHRISTIANS BY THE USUAL BLESSING OF<br>
  THEMSELVES WITH THE SIGN OF THE CROSS.</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5">J</font>esus Christ our saviour the son of God, for the
  love he did bear to mankind came down into the world, suffered death upon the Cross,
  descended into hell, &amp; with victory over hell, damnation, &amp; death he rose again,
  and in his glorified body ascended to the glory of his Father: The memory of which
  victory, and our reconciliation to God the Father, with the whole mystery of our
  redemption is celebrated of every good Christian daily by making the sign of the Cross.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this faith &amp; belief all good Christians use oftentimes to make
  the sign of the cross on their foreheads: as a continual renewing of the badge or mark of
  their Christian profession impressed in their foreheads by the priest of God at the font
  of Baptism.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this faith &amp; belief the church of God has appointed her children
  the Catholic Christians at the saying of <em>Deus in adiutorium</em> and in other parts of
  divine service to make the sign of the cross, by drawing the hand from the forehead to the
  breast, &amp; from the left shoulder to the right: with observation was appointed upon
  grave considerations: For thereby the good Christian is put in mind of diverse things
  daily &amp; hourly mete to be thought of.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the drawing down of the hand from the forehead to the breast
  reneweth the memory of the coming of the son of God down into the world to save mankind.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The removing of the hand to the left shoulder represents the descending
  of our saviour into hell, for to obtain victory over hell, damnation and death.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drawing of the hand over heart to the right shoulder for </p>
  <p align="left">[pg. 105]</p>
  <p align="left">to finish up the figure and shape of the cross resembles unto us the
  glorious recourse of our saviour Jesus Christ to his Father, for to consummate our
  redemption and reconciliation after his death upon the cross.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for so much as by the left hand in an apt form of speech all
  sinister &amp; evil things are signified: and good things by the right hand therefore the
  good Christian by drawing of the hand from the left shoulder to the right is put in mind,
  that he must withdraw his cogitation, care and study from all worldly vanities the
  sinister allurements of our ghostly enemies, &amp; to fix his heart and mind of heaven and
  heavenly things: That he must eschew the broad way of sin which lieth on the left hand:
  and tread the strait path of virtuous conversation on the right hand. And that by the
  benefit of the cross he is put in hope to pass from temporal to everlasting pleasures and
  commodities: to avoid eternal misery and obtain eternal felicity.</p>
