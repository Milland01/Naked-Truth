    <p>The following boxed text is a transcript of Roman Catholic apologist
    <a href="http://www.surprisedbytruth.com/">Patrick Madrid's</a> remarks on
    <a href="openline-01-05-2006.mp3">EWTN's
    <i>Open Line</i>, of January 05, 2006 (mp3).</a> He is responding to 
    a question regarding the allegation that the Roman Catholic Church changed 
    the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.</p>

      <td width="100%">15:27<p>Well, what we have to remember is, first of all 
      what Jesus said, He said don't forget that man was not made for the 
      Sabbath, the Sabbath was made for man [Mark 2:27]. And, the Lord Himself, we are told, 
      was the Lord of the Sabbath [Matt 12:8, Mark 2:28, Luke 6:5], so He had the authority, in areas as far as 
      how we would observe that commandment.</td>

     <blockquote>
     <p>Where was Patrick going with this? Obviously he was beginning to assert 
     that Jesus Himself changed the Sabbath commandment. Here is what Jesus said 
     about that:</p>
       <blockquote>
     <p>Mat 5:17 <font color="#FF0000">Think not that I am come to destroy the 
     law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</font><br>
     Mat 5:18 <font color="#FF0000">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and 
     earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till 
     all be fulfilled.</font><br>
     Mat 5:19 <font color="#FF0000">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these 
     least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in 
     the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same 
     shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</font></p>
       </blockquote>
     <p>The truth is that Jesus emphatically dismisses any notion that He would alter any of the 
     10 commandments.</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">15:46<p>What your brother-in-law may not understand is 
        that the Catholic Church did not change that commandment, the Catholic 
        Church observes the commandment to keep holy the Sabbath, but is does so 
        on the Lord's Day.</td>

   <blockquote>
   <p>Patrick maintains that the Catholic Church did NOT <i>change</i> the 
   Sabbath commandment, he claims they KEEP it, on SUNDAY, the Lord's day. That 
   is like asserting that Eve was in full compliance with God's instructions 
   when she ate the fruit of the forbidden tree. </p>

   <p>The truth is that God commands that the seventh day of the creation week, the Sabbath of the 
   LORD thy God, be observed as a day of rest as a memorial to creation (Exo 
   20:8-11). It is a specific day of the week, the last day of the 7 day 
   week, that God claims as <i>His</i> Sabbath, so it is quite impossible to be 
   in compliance with the Sabbath commandment on Sunday, the first day of the 
   week. What you do on the seventh day of the week, Saturday, determines 
   whether or not you are keeping God's commandment.</p>

        observance of that commandment from Saturday to Sunday, first of all 
        because their was a distinct break between the Old Testament 
        requirements, the rituals and Mosaic covenant demands dealing with the 
        Sabbath worship and animal sacrifices, and that sort of thing. </td>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The truth is that what Patrick asserts here is simply not taught by the inspired written 
    testimony of the apostolic church, the New Testament. The New Testament 
    books were all written decades after the crucifixion, and <u>none</u> of 
    them teach the transfer of the seventh day Sabbath commandment to Sunday, 
    the first day of the week. No where in the New Testament are we told that 
    Jesus or the disciples began meeting on Sunday in order to keep the Sabbath 
    commandment. This is because they were simply not observing the first day of 
    the week as the Sabbath at all, it was nothing more than the first work day 
    of the week. This was true even <i>thirty years</i> after the crucifixion, 
    when the New Testament was being written.</p>

        was distinct from Judaism. It came from Judaism, but it was distinct 
        from it. Ah, celebrating the Lord's coming, I'm sorry, celebrating the 
        Lord's resurrection and death on the day that He rose from the dead 
        seemed to be the most appropriate.</td>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Patrick is saying that anti-Semitism was the motivation for Sunday keeping. 
  Jesus Christ is a Semite. Jesus Christ kept the seventh day Saturday, and said 
  He would not change one jot or one tittle of the commandments. So, is 
  anti-Semitism a valid reason that justifies keeping Sunday instead of the 
  commanded seventh day? Isn't such anti-Semitism in fact anti-Christ? Yes, the 
  truth is that Dan 
  7:25 prophesies that the little horn power, the antichrist, would think to 
  change the times and laws of the most high God.</p>

        too, is that, our calendar that we follow, including Seventh-Day 
        Adventists, is not only a calendar that was devised by the Catholic 
        Church, but also it is a calendar that is based upon the solar year, not 
        the lunar year. And the Jewish calendar that was observed in the time of 
        Christ is, follows a lunar calendar, which is several days short of the 
        solar calendar.</td>

        <tr>
          <td width="50%">The truth is that the Catholic Church did <u>not</u> invent or devise 
          the 365 day solar calendar, pagan Rome did. It is called the Julian 
          calendar after Julius Caesar, who implemented it. The Julian calendar 
          has a leap year every fourth year of 366 days. By the 16th century, 
          the effect of the imprecision of the Julian calendar was becoming significant 
          enough that it prompted the Catholic Gregorian (Pope Gregory XIII) 
          calendar reform of 1582, in which Thursday, October 4th, was followed 
          by Friday, October 15th. The method of adding leap years was also 
          changed in order to stay in sync with the solar year. Note however, 
          that the weekly cycle of 7 days, Sunday through Saturday, was NOT 
          altered at all by the Gregorian calendar reform.</td>

        <td width="100%">17:00<p>So the great irony is that, even the 
        Seventh-Day Adventists themselves are not worshipping on exactly the 
        same Sabbath day as the Jews of the time of Christ, because it is 
        several days off now, ah, having switched to following the lunar 
        calendar.</td>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b><i><font size="4">WHAT?</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b>Just where does the 
    Roman Catholic Church officially teach this? [Patrick apparently actually 
    meant to assert that the true Sabbath was lost in the Gregorian calendar 
    reform of the Catholic Church, but that only involved adjusting the existing 
    solar Julian calendar. It did not involve a switch to &quot;following the lunar calendar&quot; as 
    stated, or switching <i>from</i> a lunar calendar, either.]</p>
    <p>If the Seventh-Day Adventists 
    (and the Jews, incidentally) are not keeping the true seventh day Sabbath 
    (Saturday) in their abysmal ignorance, then just <u>why</u> does the Roman 
    Catholic Church keep the very next day in celebration of the Sunday 
    resurrection? If Saturday has been lost, hasn't Sunday been lost to us as 
    well? The Roman&nbsp;Catholics LOST SUNDAY in <i>their own</i> calendar 
    reform? Could anything be more more absurdly stupid than this assertion?</p>
    <p>This is what passes muster at EWTN and Roman Catholic apologetics? This 
    is nothing more than smoke and mirrors, a snow job, that gives the illusion 
    that Patrick Madrid knows what he is talking about. Clearly he does not, 
    when the facts are examined. The truth is that millions of Jews have kept 
    the seventh day Saturday Sabbath for thousands of years, and this practice 
    was not altered or lost by either the Julian or Gregorian calendars. They 
    are still keeping the same seventh day Sabbath that was instituted at 
    creation, the same day as was commanded at Sinai and kept by Moses, the same 
    day as kept by Jesus and the apostles, and that day is our Saturday.</p>
