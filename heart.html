      depict an exposed heart, and if you look closely, many times you will see 
      that there is a surrounding sun burst and a flame on top of the heart. An 
      example of this can be seen at left, which by Catholic teaching, portrays 
      the immaculate heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to which Catholics are to 
      consecrate themselves.
      <p>Consecration is defined by the Catholic Encyclopedia as &quot;the act and 
      ceremony by which a person or thing is dedicated to sacred service or set 
      apart for sacred use.&quot; So for a Catholic to consecrate themselves to the 
      Immaculate Heart of Mary is to dedicate their life in service to Mary.</td>

  <p>Here are examples of this Catholic teaching, beginning with consecration to 
  Mary:</p>
  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="2">
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="4">Give all to Jesus through Mary</font></strong></p>
  <p>When a person is truly consecrated to Mary, he lives that consecration each 
  day by giving himself and all that he has to the Mother of God. This includes 
  his natural property and possessions as well as his supernatural merits and 
  graces. EVERYTHING is presented to Mary to use as she wills.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="heart1.jpg" hspace="20" vspace="10" width="176" 
        height="251"></td>
        <td>Indeed, this total offering often frightens many people, but it 
        should not. Those who cannot entrust their lives and possessions to Mary 
        do not really know her very well. The Mother of God is all love, mercy 
        and goodness. Basically, this is the message of her Immaculate Heart.
        <p>No Christian who understands his faith would be fearful about giving 
        everything to Jesus, for the God-Man is completely worthy and deserving 
        of trust. But the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary 
        beat as one. That is to say, Mary's will is always the same as her 
        Divine Son's. Since God wants devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary 
        established in the world, those who consecrate themselves to the Mother 
        of God do the will of her Son. They go to Jesus in union with Mary.</td>

  <hr>
  <p>This consecration in service to Mary is quite contrary to scripture and the 
  teachings of Jesus-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is 
    written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and <strong><em>him only shalt 
    thou serve</em>.</strong></p>
    <p>Luke 4:8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: 
    for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and <strong><em>him 
    only shalt thou serve</em>.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And now the Catholic teaching on the Sacred Heart of Jesus:</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><strong><font size="4">Sacred Heart of Jesus</font></strong></p>
  <p>1. The Sacred Heart of Jesus is a devotion to Jesus Christ, consisting of 
  worship of Him through His heart as representing His love shown in the 
  Incarnation. His passion and death, the institution of the Eucharist. The 
  devotion is centered on reparation to Christ for man's ingratitude, manifested 
  particularly by indifference to the Holy Eucharist. The worship is not 
  directed to the Heart alone, but to the Person of Jesus Christ. The Church 
  forbids public cult of the Heart separated from the rest of the body, but 
  allows private veneration, as is the case of Sacred Heart badges.</p>
  <div align="center">
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
      <tr>

        height="252"></td>
        <td>2. A feast, requested by our Lord Himself, commemorates the 
        unrequited love of the Sacred Heart in the Eucharist and is celebrated 
        on the Friday after the feast of Corpus Christi.
        <p>3. Enthronement of the Sacred Heart in the home is acknowledgment of 
        the sovereignty of Christ over the family. It is expressed through 
        solemn installation of the head of the house of a representation of the 
        Sacred Heart in a place of honor, together with an act of consecration, 
        in the presence of the entire family. Another indulgenced practice for 
        individuals or families is to spend an hour in reparation before the 
        Blessed Sacrament or before an image of the Sacred Heart in the home 
        between the hours of 9 P.M. and 6 A.M.</td>

  <p>According to Catholic teaching-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It was to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, a humble nun of the Order of the 
    Visitation of Our Lady that Our Lord chose to reveal to the world His Sacred 
    Heart, thus opening a New Era of Grace and Mercy in the history of the 
    Church and the world. These private revelations took place during the years 
    1673-1675, and are drawn from the diary of St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, the 
    witness of her fellow sisters, and that of her spiritual director, St. 
    Claude de La Colombiere.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice how St. Margaret Mary Alacoque describes the revelation of the 
  &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; of Jesus (emphasis is mine):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Our Lord makes known the Devotion of the First Fridays: June 1674</p>
    <p>On the First Friday of each month, the above-mentioned grace connected 
    with the pain in my side was renewed in the following manner: <em><strong>
    the Sacred Heart was represented to me as a resplendent sun</strong></em>, 
    the burning rays of which fell vertically upon my heart, which was inflamed 
    with a fire so fervid that it seemed as if it would reduce me to ashes. It 
    was at these times especially that my Divine Master taught me what He 
    required of me and disclosed to me the secrets of His loving Heart. On one 
    occasion, while the Blessed Sacrament was exposed, feeling wholly withdrawn 
    within myself by an extraordinary recollection of all my senses and powers, 
    Jesus Christ, my sweet Master, presented Himself to me, all resplendent with 
    glory, His Five Wounds shining like so many suns. Flames issued from every 
    part of His Sacred Humanity, especially from His Adorable Breast, which 
    resembled an open furnace and disclosed to me His most loving and most 
    amiable Heart, which was the living source of these flames. It was then that 
    He made known to me the ineffable marvels of His pure love and showed me to 
    what an excess He had loved men, from whom He received only ingratitude and 
    contempt.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Source: <i>The Revelation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</i>, online at
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <strong>
  <a href="http://www.mantle.org/devotion/histsacheart.html">The Mantle,</a>
  </strong>the Apostolate Alliance of the Two Hearts.</p>
  <hr width="40%" align="center" size="2">
  <p>So the Catholic Church encourages people to &quot;enthrone&quot; an image of the 
  flaming heart of Jesus in their home and venerate or worship it. As shown 
  above, the first Friday of every month and indeed the whole month of June are 
  set aside for the veneration of the flaming Sacred Heart of Jesus.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness 
    of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or 
    that is in the water under the earth:<br>
    Exo 20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
    LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
    children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above commandment of God makes no exception for images of hearts. 
  Bowing down to, or venerating any image what-so-ever is clearly prohibited, 
  yet the Roman Catholic church teaches its people to do exactly that.</p>

  Advent Supersite:</p>

  <p>And here are no less than four papal encyclicals that are dedicated to the 
  cult of the Sacred Heart:</p>
  <p><strong><img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12">
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13ANNUM.htm"><em>Annum Sacrum</em></a>
  </strong>by Leo XIII in 1899.<br>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <strong>
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P11CARIT.htm"><em>Caritate Christis 
  Compulsi</em></a> </strong>by Pius XI in 1932.<br>

  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P11MISER.htm"><em>Miserrentissimus 
  Redemtor</em></a> </strong>by Pius XI in 1928.<br>
  <img src="star.gif" width="16" height="12"> <strong>
  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/P12HAURI.htm"><em>Haurietis Aquas</em></a>
  </strong>by Pius XII in 1956.</p>
  <p>It is worth noting the following from <em>Haurietis Aquas</em>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>23. It is of course beyond doubt that the Sacred Books never make express 
    mention of a special worship of veneration and love made to the physical 
    Heart of the Incarnate Word as the symbol of His burning love.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, Pius XII readily admits that veneration of the Sacred Heart is 
  unbiblical. This prompts the question, just where does this type of worship 
  really originate?</p>
