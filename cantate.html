<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    It [the Roman Church] firmly believes, professes, and teaches that the
    matter pertaining to the law of the Old Testament, of the Mosaic law, which
    are divided into ceremonies, sacred rites, sacrifices, and sacraments,
    because they were established to signify something in the future, although
    they were suited to the divine worship at that time, after our Lord's coming
    had been signified by them, ceased, and the sacraments of the New Testament
    began; and that whoever, even after the passion, placed hope in these
    matters of the law and submitted himself to them as necessary for salvation,
    as if faith in Christ could not save without them, sinned mortally. Yet it
    does not deny that after the passion of Christ up to the promulgation of the
    Gospel they could have been observed until they were believed to be in no
    way necessary for salvation; but after the promulgation of the Gospel it
    asserts that they cannot be observed without the loss of eternal salvation.
    All, therefore, who after that time observe circumcision and the Sabbath and
    the other requirements of the law, it declares alien to the Christian faith
    and not in the least fit to participate in eternal salvation, unless someday
    they recover from these errors.
