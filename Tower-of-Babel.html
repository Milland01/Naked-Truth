    <p align="left">Gen 11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one 
    speech.<br>
    Gen 11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they 
    found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br>
    Gen 11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn 
    them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for 
    mortar.<br>
    Gen 11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top 
    may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered 
    abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br>
    Gen 11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the 
    children of men builded.<br>
    Gen 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one 
    language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from 
    them, which they have imagined to do.<br>
    Gen 11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they 
    may not understand one another's speech.<br>
    Gen 11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all 
    the earth: and they left off to build the city.<br>
    Gen 11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did 
    there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD 
    scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p align="left">The European Union is clearly saying symbolically that their 
  goal is a defiant reversal of an act of God. The prophecy of Daniel chapter 2 
  tells us that this end-time attempt at unification will ultimately fail as an 
  unfinished work, that it will soon be replaced by the Kingdom of God.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Dan 2:43 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, 
    they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave 
    one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.<br>
    Dan 2:44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a 
    kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left 
    to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these 
    kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p align="left"><span class="maintext">The EU expanded from 15 members to 25 in 
2004, making a new constitution necessary for practical governing.&nbsp; </span>Before it could come into effect, the EU constitution had to be ratified by all 25 EU 
member states, either through a referendum or by a parliamentary vote. Nine 
countries already had done so: Austria, Hungary, Italy, Germany, Greece, 
Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain<strong><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: 400">h</span></strong>o<strong><span style="font-weight: 400">w</span></strong>e<strong style="font-weight: 400">ver, 
rejection by even a single remaining country would 
prevent it from taking effect in </strong>November of 2006.
<strong style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;The &quot;no&quot; vote that 
derailed the EU constitution happened on May 29th, 2005 in France. The Netherlands 
also voted &quot;no&quot; on June 1st, 2005 and the United Kingdom announced on June 6th, 
2005 that 
it would not vote on the constitution. For all practical purposes, the EU 
constitution and its attempt at unity is dead. </strong></p>

<p align="left">
<strong style="font-weight: 400">As of January 1, 2007, the EU expanded to 27 
nations with the addition of Bulgaria and Romania.</strong></p>

<p align="left">
The European Union dropped plans for a constitution and decided to amend 
two existing treaties instead. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7141651.stm">Signed by the heads of state in Lisbon on December 13th, 2007</a>, 
it still had be ratified by all 27 member nations to go into effect. Ireland, 
the only country to put the treaty to a public vote, defeated the Lisbon treaty 
proposition on June 12th, 2008. </p>

  <p align="left">In September of 2009, Czech senators filed a complaint against 
  the treaty in the constitutional courts that delayed Czech signing of the 
  treaty.</p>

  <p align="left">Ireland voted again on October 2nd, 2009, approving the Lisbon 
  treaty, and Poland's President signed the Treaty on October 10th, 
  leaving only the Czech republic's president to approve it, who has said he 
  will not sign the treaty unless his country is granted an opt-out from the 
  EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

  <p align="left">On November 3rd, 2009, Czech president Vaclav Klaus signed the 
  Lisbon Treaty, after the complaint to the constitutional courts was rejected.&nbsp; 
  The Treaty became law on December 1st.</p>

  <p align="left">Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125865479105255999.html">chosen unanimously</a> 
  by the 27 European heads of government over dinner on November 
  19th to become EU President, is a devout Roman Catholic who was educated at the 
  Jesuit Sint-Jan Berchmans College in central Brussels, and has degrees in 
  philosophy and applied economics from the Catholic University of Leuven. This 
  brings to mind:</p>

  which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour 
  with the beast.<br>
  Rev 17:13 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto 
  the beast.</p>
