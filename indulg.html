<blockquote>
  <p><strong><u>The Communion of Saints</u></strong></p>
  <p>In Catholic teaching, there are three distinct groups that comprise the
  Church:
  <p>The <em>Church Militant</em> is the body of believers still living on this
  earth and &quot;fighting&quot; for their salvation.
  <p>The <em>Church Triumphant</em> are the angels and those believers who have
  previously lived on this earth and are now in rejoicing in their heavenly
  home. Because their good works while on earth exceeded the requirement, the
  Church Triumphant have an &quot;excess&quot; treasury of merits of God's
  grace, which can then be re-distributed via Mary the Mediatrix of all Grace,
  and via the Church in the form of indulgences.
  <p>The <em>Church Suffering</em> are those believers who have died, but
  because of remaining unsatisfied temporal punishment due because of their sin,
  they must spend time in the cleansing fires of Purgatory. They will remain
  there until they have been completely purged of sin, and the temporal
  punishment they are due is completely satisfied. They are then acceptable to
  enter heaven.

    might be weakening, losing something of its completeness or entering into an
    area of shadow and silence, threatened as it is by the negative elements of
    the above-mentioned crisis. For the sacrament of confession is indeed being
    undermined, on the one hand by the obscuring of the mortal and religious
    conscience, the lessening of a sense of sin, the distortion of the concept
    of repentance and the lack of effort to live an authentically Christian
    life. And on the other hand, it is being <b>undermined by the sometimes
    widespread idea that one can obtain forgiveness directly from God, even in a
    habitual way, without approaching the sacrament of reconciliation. </b>A
    further negative influence is the routine of a sacramental practice
    sometimes lacking in fervor and real spontaneity, deriving perhaps from a
    mistaken and distorted idea of the effects of the sacrament.</p>

  AND PENANCE</b></a></i>, dated December 2nd, 1984.</p>
  <p>The Pope is saying that a Catholic <i><b>must</b> </i>seek out a priest to
  confess their sins and ask forgiveness <b><i>only through the priest,</i></b><i><b>
  </b></i>and that this &quot;sacrament&quot; of confession/penance is
  undermined by those who think they can directly approach God directly for
  forgiveness. This makes the Catholic priest essential in the process of
  salvation, since he stands in the place of God, as another mediator between
  man and God. This is not a novel teaching in the Catholic Church, is has a
  long history:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Leo the Great (440-461) writes: &quot;God in His
    abundant mercy has provided two remedies for the sins of men; that they may
    gain eternal life by the grace of Baptism, and also by the remedy of
    Penance. Those who have violated the vows of their Baptism may obtain the
    remission of their sins by condemning themselves; the divine goodness has so
    decreed that [pg. 284] <b>the pardon of God can only be obtained by sinners
    through the prayers of the priests</b>. Jesus Christ Himself has conferred
    upon the rulers of the Church the power of imposing canonical penance upon
    sinners who confess their sins, and of allowing them to receive the
    Sacraments of Christ, after they have purified their souls by a salutary
    satisfaction. . . . &quot; (<i>Epis</i>. cviii.). [Emphasis supplied]</p>

  <p>Note what scripture says about confessing our sins to God:</p>
  <blockquote>

    <p>1 John 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
    fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth
    us from all sin.<br>
    1 John 1:8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
    truth is not in us.<br>

    sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.<br>

  <p><strong><u>The Auricular Confession - The Sacrament of Penance.</u></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>188 Q. How does the the Sacrament of Penance remit sin, and restore the
    soul to the friendship of God?<br>
    A. The Sacrament of Penance remits sin and restores the friendship of God to
    the soul by means of the absolution of the priest.</p>
    <p><strong>&quot;Absolution&quot;</strong> means the words the priest says
    at the time he forgives sins. <em>Absolve</em> means to loose or free.
    <p>219 Q. Does not the Sacrament of Penance remit all punishment due to sin?<br>
    A. The Sacrament of Penance remits the eternal punishment due to sin, but it
    does not always remit the temporal punishment which God requires as
    satisfaction for our sins.&nbsp;
  </blockquote>
  Source: <i>Baltimore Catechism</i> (#4)
  <p>So a Catholic who is truly sorry, confesses their sins to the priest in
  what is called the Auricular Confession. After weighing the gravity of the
  confessed sins, the priest, acting in the place of God, absolves (forgives)
  the sinner of the eternal punishment due (but not necessarily all the temporal
  punishment) for those confessed sins, and gives them a penance (good work) to
  perform. This is generally falls into the categories of prayer, fasting,
  almsgiving, spiritual and corporal works of mercy, and patient suffering of
  the ills of life. By performing the penance, the Catholic is taught they
  reduce the temporal punishment they are due, either on this earth or
  purgatory, to some degree.

  <p><strong><u>Indulgences</u></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    The remission of the temporal punishment due for sins and hence, the
    satisfaction owed to God for one's sins is called an indulgence. The Church
    grants such indulgences after the guilt of sin and its eternal punishment
    have been remitted by sacramental absolution or by perfect contrition. (c.
    992) Indulgences are <em>plenary</em> or <em>partial</em>; plenary, when
    they remit all of the temporal punishment resulting from sin; partial, when
    a part of this punishment is remitted. Should one seek to gain a plenary
    indulgence but, because of some unforgiven venial sin, not all of the
    temporal punishment is taken away, that person gains at least a partial
    indulgence (c. 993).
    <p>As granted by the Church in terms of time (years, days, and quarantines),
    a partial indulgence remits as much of the temporal punishment as would be
    expiated by the performance of a canonical (imposed) penance in the early
    Church for that length of time or for the penances of a fasting season
    (quarantine). Indulgences granted by the Church may be gained for oneself or
    for the souls in purgatory, unless otherwise declared, but no one can gain
    an indulgence for another living person (c. 994).
    <p>The granting of indulgences is founded upon three doctrines of Catholic
    faith: the treasury of the merits of the communion of saints, Christ
    Himself, and the Blessed Virgin and the saints. ...&nbsp;

  <hr width="30%" align="center" size="2">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Since partial indulgences were formerly designated by specific amounts of
    time, you sometimes see printed after a little prayer: An indulgence of
    forty days, or, an indulgence of one hundred days, or of a year, etc. What
    does that mean? Does it mean that a person who said that prayer would get
    out of Purgatory forty days sooner than he would have if he had not said it?
    No. I told you how the early Christians were obliged to do public penance
    for their sins; to stand at the door of the church and beg the prayers of
    those entering. Sometimes their penance lasted for forty days, sometimes for
    one hundred days, and sometimes for a longer period. By an indulgence of
    forty days the Church granted the remission of as much of the temporal
    punishment as the early Christians would have received for doing forty days'
    public penance. Just how much of the temporal punishment God blotted out for
    forty days' public penance we do not know; but whatever it was, God blotted
    out just the same for one who gained an indulgence of forty days by saying a
    little prayer to which the indulgence was attached. But why, you may wonder,
    did the early Christians do such penances? Because in those days their faith
    was stronger than ours, and they understood better than we do the malice of
    sin and the punishment it deserves. Later the Christians grew more careless
    about their religion and the service of God. The Church, therefore, wishing
    to save its children, made it easier for them to do penance. If it had
    continued to impose the public penances, many would not have performed them,
    and thus would have lost their souls.</p>

    temporal punishment for sin the guilt of which is already forgiven, which a
    properly disposed member of the Christian faithful obtains under certain and
    definite conditions with the help of the Church which, as the minister of
    redemption, dispenses and applies authoritatively the treasury of the

  <hr>
  <p>So as can be deduced from the above, the Catholic believes they are
  normally in a state of owing God satisfaction for the temporal punishment they
  are due because of sin, and they are expecting to spend some time in purgatory
  until they are cleansed by its fire and made fit for heaven. The Catholic
  believes they have to constantly perform good works to try and lessen the
  punishment they will receive. The Catholic literally tries to &quot;work&quot;
  their way into heaven, thinking they are making themselves acceptable to God
  in the process. Should they somehow fall short and wind up in purgatory
  instead, they then rely on the good works of friends and relatives to get them
  out of purgatory and into heaven. An exception to this would be when they have
  recently and faithfully performed a plenary (full) penance or indulgence, and
  die in a pristine state of grace. In that case, they are told, they will
  bypass purgatory and enter heaven immediately.
  <p>Is this what the Bible teaches? Are we to work off the &quot;temporal
  punishment&quot; we are supposedly due through penance or indulgences, or burn
  in purgatory in order to make it to heaven? What does the Bible say about
  justification and forgiveness of sins?</p>
  <blockquote>
    Acts 26:18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and
    from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins,
    and inheritance among them which are sanctified <strong>by faith</strong>
    that is in me.
    <p>Rom 3:22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ
    unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:<br>
    Rom 3:23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br>
    Rom 3:24 Being <strong>justified freely</strong> by his grace through the
    redemption that is in Christ Jesus:<br>
    Rom 3:25 Whom God hath set forth to be a <strong>propitiation through faith
    in his blood</strong>, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
    sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;<br>
    Rom 3:26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be
    just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.<br>
    Rom 3:27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay:
    but by the law of faith.<br>
    Rom 3:28 Therefore we conclude that <strong>a man is justified by faith</strong>
    without the deeds of the law.
    <p>Rom 5:1 Therefore being <strong>justified by faith</strong>, we have
    peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:
    <p>Gal 2:16 Knowing that <strong>a man is not justified by the works of the
    law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ</strong>, even we have believed in
    Jesus Christ, that we might be <strong>justified by the faith of Christ</strong>,
    and <strong>not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall
    no flesh be justified.</strong>
    <p>Eph 1:7 In whom we have <strong>redemption through his blood, the
    forgiveness of sins</strong>, according to the riches of his grace;
    <p>Col 1:14 In whom <strong>we have redemption through his blood, even the
    forgiveness of sins:</strong>
    <p>1 Pet 1:18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not <strong>redeemed</strong>
    with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation
    received by tradition from your fathers;<br>
    1 Pet 1:19 But <strong>with the precious blood of Christ</strong>, as of a
    lamb without blemish and without spot:
    <p>1 John 1:9 <strong>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
    forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from <em>ALL</em> unrighteousness</strong>.<br>
    1 John 1:10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
    word is not in us.<br>
    1 John 2:1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
    not. And if any man sin, <strong>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
    Christ the righteous</strong>:<br>
    1 John 2:2 And <strong>he is the propitiation for our sins</strong>: and not
    for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
    <p>1 John 2:12 I write unto you, little children, because <strong>your sins
    are forgiven you for his name's sake.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We are justified freely by faith in the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. The
  price for our sins has been paid in full. If we confess our sins to our
  heavenly high priest, Jesus Christ, he is just and faithful to forgive our
  sins <em>completely</em>. God does not demand satisfaction for our sins as
  Catholics are taught and no earthly priest is required to receive forgiveness.
  Jesus has already paid that price and offers His righteousness to us as a <em>free</em>
  gift. But as with any gift, we have to accept it. You do that by having faith
  that the blood of Jesus has completely and forever covered your sins. Pray to
  Jesus for forgiveness, and you will indeed be <em>completely</em> forgiven of
  your sin.</p>
