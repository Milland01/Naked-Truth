      </div>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      The Roman Catholic Church has been talking for years about a "new
      evangelization" that must be embarked on to carry out its mission. The
      focal point of this outreach has been clearly defined:&nbsp; <br>
      <blockquote><font><font face="Times" size="3">14. ..."We wish to confirm
            once more that the task of evangelizing all people constitutes the
            essential mission of the Church."[36] It is a task and mission which
            the vast and profound changes of present-day society make all the
            more urgent. Evangelizing is in fact the grace and vocation proper
            to the Church, her deepest identity. She exists in order to
            evangelize, that is to say, in order to preach and teach, to be the
            channel of the gift of grace, to reconcile sinners with God, and to
            perpetuate Christ's sacrifice in the Mass, which is the memorial of
            His death and glorious resurrection.</font></font></blockquote>
      <blockquote><font><font face="Times">28. ... For in its totality,
            evangelization - over and above the preaching of a message -
            consists in the implantation of the Church, which does not exist
            without the driving force which is the sacramental life culminating
            in the Eucharist. <br>
            &#8213; <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_p-vi_exh_19751208_evangelii-nuntiandi_en.html"><i>Evangelii
                Nuntiandi</i></a>, Apostolic Exhortation of POPE PAUL VI, </font></font><font
          face="Times" size="3"> December 8, 1975</font><br>
      </blockquote>
      So, when you hear Catholics talking today about the "new evangelization",
      they are talking about universally promoting the Eucharistic sacrifice of
      Christ in the Sunday Catholic Mass. On Sept 21, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI in
      his Motu Proprio <a href="http://www.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_letters/documents/hf_ben-xvi_apl_20100921_ubicumque-et-semper_en.html">UBICUMQUE
ET
        SEMPER</a> established the Pontifical Council for New Evangelization, by
      which he is moving towards implementation. A recent major step was a
      Vatican sponsored meeting of Catholic families from all over the world in
      Milan:<br>

        </align="center"></strong>The purpose of this meeting is to instruct
      Catholic families in the doctrine of the Sunday Tradition, and seeks to
      explain why it is the essential factor in the Christian family. The
      current magisterial <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> states Sunday
      observance is an apostolic Tradition of supreme importance:<br>
      <blockquote><span class="text"><b>2177 </b>The Sunday celebration of the
          Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the Church's life.
          "Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light
          of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost holy
          day of obligation in the universal Church."<br>
          <br>
        </span><span class="text"><b>2181</b> The Sunday Eucharist is the
          foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice.</span><br>
      </blockquote>
      Of particular interest is the alleged "Biblical Catechesis" for this world
      meeting, which purports to give sound reasoning from the Bible for
      replacing God's Sabbath commandment with Sunday. The Catholic Church has
      long recognized that weekly Sunday keeping to honor the resurrection is
      not found in the Bible, not commanded by God, or observed by the Apostles.
      Indeed, on the eighteenth of January, 1562, <a href="bssb-1443-1444.html">Gaspar
        de Fosso, the Archbishop of Reggio</a>, stood before the Council of
      Trent and declared openly that tradition stood above Scripture, the
      authority of the church could therefore not be bound to the authority of
      the Scriptures, because the church had changed Sabbath into Sunday, not by
      the command of Christ, but by its own authority. <br>
      <br>
      The <i><a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2.htm">Catechism
of
          the Catholic Church</a></i> today states clearly that the 10
      Commandments cannot be changed by anyone:<br>
      <blockquote><span class="text"><b>2072</b> Since they express man's
          fundamental duties towards God and towards his neighbor, the Ten
          Commandments reveal, in their primordial content, grave obligations.
          They are fundamentally immutable, and they oblige always and
          everywhere. No one can dispense from them. The Ten Commandments are
          engraved by God in the human heart.</span><br>
        <span class="text"></span><br>
        <span class="text"></span><span class="text"><b>2076</b> By his life and
          by his preaching Jesus attested to the permanent validity of the
          Decalogue. </span><br>
        <span class="text"></span><br>
        <span class="text"></span><span class="text"><b>2079</b> The Decalogue
          forms an organic unity in which each "word" or "commandment" refers to
          all the others taken together. To transgress one commandment is to
          infringe the whole Law (cf. <i>Jas </i>2:10-11). </span><span class="text"></span><br>
      </blockquote>
      The above <a href="http://www.family2012.com/en/catecheses/">Preparatory
        Catecheses</a> however, attempts to demonstrate that the Sabbath
      Commandment was annulled by Jesus, and that Sunday is the 7th day for the
      Christian, which is to be observed as the new Christian day of rest:<br>
      <blockquote>5. E. ... <em> So Sunday should not take the form of an
          interval from work to be filled with frenetic activities or unusual
          experiences, but rather a day of rest which opens up to the encounter,
          lets the other be rediscovered, and makes it possible to dedicate time
          to family relations and friends and to prayer.</em><br>
        <br>
        It is particularly urgent nowadays to remember that the day of the Lord
        is also a day of rest from work. It is greatly to be hoped that this
        fact will also be recognized by civil society, so that individuals can
        be permitted to refrain from work without being penalized. Christians,
        not without reference to the meaning of the Sabbath in the Jewish
        tradition, have seen in the Lord&#8217;s Day a day of rest from their daily
        exertions.<br>
        <br>
        8. D. 1. ... The seventh day for Christians is the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s day&#8221; [Sunday]
        because it celebrates the Risen Christ who is present and living in the
        Christian community, the family and personal life. It is the weekly
        resurrection. Sunday does not break the continuity with the Hebrew
        sabbath but brings it to completion.<br>
        <br>
        9. D. 1. ... The sabbath is the day of Jesus&#8217; acts of liberation.
        Finally, Jesus is the &#8220;Lord&#8221; of the sabbath. By renewing the work of
        creation and liberation from evil, Jesus reveals himself as the fullness
        of life, the end of the commandment regarding the sabbath.<br>
        <br>
        9. E. ... <i>The family is jealous of Sunday, the &#8220;day of joy and
          rest&#8221;;</i></blockquote>
      That catechesis is patently false. It is impossible for Sunday keeping to
      fulfill the seventh day sabbath commandment. The Bible quotes Jesus as
      saying that his law remains unchanged until heaven and earth pass away:<span
        style="line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0px;"><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','Arial','Helvetica',sans-serif; font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: 4px; font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
      <blockquote>Matt 5:17 (KJV)<span style="line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0px;"><span
            style="font-family: 'Verdana','Arial','Helvetica',sans-serif; font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: 4px; font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;<span
            style="color: red;">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or
            the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</span> <br>
          <span style="font-family: 'Verdana','Arial','Helvetica',sans-serif; font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: 4px; font-weight: bold;">18</span>&nbsp;<span
            style="color: red;">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth
            pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till
            all be fulfilled.</span> <br>
          <span style="font-family: 'Verdana','Arial','Helvetica',sans-serif; font-size: 0.7em; vertical-align: 4px; font-weight: bold;">19</span>&nbsp;<span
            style="color: red;">Whosoever therefore shall break one of these
            least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
            least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach <i>them</i>,
            the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> </span></blockquote>
      Yet, the <i>Catechism of the Council of Trent</i> boldly claimed: <span
        style="line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0px;"></span><br>
      <blockquote> But the Church of God has in her wisdom ordained that the
        celebration of the Sabbath should be transferred to "the Lord's
        day:"&nbsp;<font><font face="Times"> &#8213; </font></font> <i>The Catechism
          of the Council of Trent</i><em>,</em> Issued by order of Pope Pius
        V,&nbsp;<b><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=68z6M7ou8pAC&amp;dq=the%20catechism%20of%20the%20council%20of%20trent&amp;pg=PA263#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The
Third
            Commandment</a></b>, pg. 267.<br>
      </blockquote>
      As anyone can see, Catholic teaching on its Sundaykeeping Tradition is a
      confusing tangle of contradictions, but the Bible clearly teaches only the
      seventh day Sabbath (our Saturday), as commanded by God, to be the
      sanctified weekly day of rest: <br>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"... is not every Christian obliged to sanctify Sunday and to abstain
          on that day from unnecessary servile work? Is not the observance of
          this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties? But, you may
          read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will not find a
          single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The Scriptures
          enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which we never
          sanctify."</p>

      <p>So the "New Evangelization" of the Catholic Church promotes their
        Sunday rest Tradition, but it is only a commandment of the Pope, it is
        not taught anywhere in the Bible, they know full well there is no "Thus
        saith the Lord" for Sunday rest.</p>

        <p class="auto-style13"><span class="auto-style8">One final point: man,
            as the image of God, is also called to rest and to celebrate. The
            account of creation concludes with these words: &#8220;And on the seventh
            day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the
            seventh day from all his work which he had done. So God blessed the
            seventh day and hallowed it&#8221; (<i>Gen</i> 2:2-3). For us Christians,
            the feast day is Sunday, the Lord&#8217;s day, the weekly Easter. It is
            the day of the Church, the assembly convened by the Lord around the
            table of the word and of the eucharistic Sacrifice, just as we are

      <p>The Bible never declares the first day of the week to be a weekly feast
        day or a day of rest for the church, or a weekly Easter, nor does it
        declare it to be "the Lord's Day", neither is it a weekly convocation
        day ordered by the Lord. Sunday keeping is a tradition and commandment
        of men that makes the law of God of no effect. </p>

        <p>Benedict XVI in the catechesis of his <a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-34925?l=english">general
            audience in St. Peter&#8217;s Square on June 6th, 2012</a>, said:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> Here I would like to recall what I stated in defense of
        family time, which is threatened by a kind of &#8220;overbearance&#8221; of work
        commitments: Sunday is the Lord&#8217;s day and man&#8217;s day, a day when everyone
        should be able to be free, free for family and free for God. In
        defending Sunday, we defend man&#8217;s freedom! </blockquote>
      <p>God has declared the seventh day sabbath blessed, to be kept holy as
        the weekly day of rest. The Pope in defiance says no, Sunday, the first
        day of the week is to be our day of freedom. Freedom from what? God's
        law? The seventh day (Saturday) sabbath commandment, however, by keeping
        it holy, is an open declaration that you acknowledge the Lord as the
        creator God, that you are his faithful obedient servant. </p>
      <p class="auto-style5">Romans 6:16 (KJV) Know ye not, that to whom ye
        yield yourselves servants to <a id="essa" name="31885x12"></a>obey, his
        servants ye are to whom ye <a id="essa0" name="31885x20"></a>obey;
        whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </p>
      <p>By keeping Sunday, whose obedient servant are you? Who commands Sunday
        observance? Only the papacy.</p>
      <p>In October of 2012 at the conclusion of the <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/synod/documents/rc_synod_doc_20110202_lineamenta-xiii-assembly_en.html">synod
of
          Catholic Bishops</a> that discussed this "New Evangelization" <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2012/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20121028_conclusione-sinodo_en.html">
          the Pope stated:</a></p>
      <p class="auto-style5">"The new evangelization applies to the whole of the
        Church&#8217;s life.&nbsp; It applies, in the first instance, to the ordinary
        pastoral ministry that must be more animated by the fire of the Spirit,
        so as to inflame the hearts of the faithful who regularly take part in
        community worship and gather on the Lord&#8217;s day to be nourished by his
        word and by the bread of eternal life."</p>
