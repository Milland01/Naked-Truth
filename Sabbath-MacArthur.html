 href="http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/90-379" target="_blank"><b><i>Understanding
the Sabbath</i></b></a> by John MacArthur of Grace to You, Unleashing
God's Truth One Verse At A Time. He makes the following assertion: <br>

 id="ctl00_ctl00_MainSection_ResourceSection_lblContent"></span><span
 id="ctl00_ctl00_MainSection_ResourceSection_lblContent">I
think it's legitimate to consider Seventh Day Adventism as a cult
because they believe that the writings of Ellen G. White are inspired
by God and could be put alongside the Bible. But they identify
themselves as faithful to the fourth command." </span></dd>
  </dl>
  <span id="ctl00_ctl00_MainSection_ResourceSection_lblContent">He then
attempts to demonstrate that the Sabbath commandment was abrogated by
Jesus. The
Bible clearly states that the gift of prophecy, and commandment
keeping, are clearly characteristic of
the true church just prior to the second coming: </span><br>

  <blockquote> </blockquote>
  <dl>
Joel 2:28-31 (KJV):<br>
  </dl>
  <blockquote>

    </dl>
    <p><sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-22340">28 </sup>And it shall
come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh;
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall
dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:<br>
    <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-22341">29 </sup>And also upon the
servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.<br>
    <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-22342">30 </sup>And I will shew
wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars
of smoke.<br>
    <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-22343">31</sup> The sun shall be
turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and
terrible day of the LORD come.</p>
  </blockquote>
Rev 12:17 (KJV):<br>
  <blockquote> <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30909">17 </sup>And
the dragon was
wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her
seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of
Jesus Christ.<br>
  </blockquote>
Rev 19:10 (KJV):<br>
  <blockquote> <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-31028">10</sup> ...
worship God: for
the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. <br>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<dl>
  <dd>Rev 4:11 (KJV):<br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dd>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30780">11</sup> Thou art
worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast
created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</dd>
  </dl>
Rev 14:6-12 (KJV):<br>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30933">6 </sup>And I saw
another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel
to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30934">7 </sup>Saying with a
loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his
judgment is come: and <u>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and
the
sea,</u> and the fountains of waters.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30935">8 </sup>And there
followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that
great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath
of her fornication.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30936">9</sup> And the third
angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the
beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his
hand,<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30937">10</sup> The same shall
drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without
mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with
fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the
presence of the Lamb:<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30938">11</sup> And the smoke of
their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day
nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth
the mark of his name.<br>
&nbsp;<sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-30939">12 </sup>Here is the
patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of
God, and the faith of Jesus. </p>
  </blockquote>
Note that Revelation 14:7 is a quote of the 4th Commandment:<br>
  <br>
Exodus 20:8-11 (KJV):<br>
</blockquote>
</span>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-2060">8</sup> Remember
the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br>
    <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-2061">9</sup> Six days shalt thou
labour, and do all thy work:<br>
    <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-2062">10</sup> But the seventh day
is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:|<br>
    <sup class="versenum" id="en-KJV-2063">11 </sup>For in six days <u>the
LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,</u> and
rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and
hallowed it.&nbsp; <span
 id="ctl00_ctl00_MainSection_ResourceSection_lblContent"><br>
    </span></blockquote>
So in labeling them a cult, John MacArthur makes a point of
highlighting defining
characteristics of the true
church just prior to the second coming, according to the Bible, and
singles out only the Seventh-day Adventists as having them, the very
points that anger Satan (Rev. 12:17), they worship the Creator
by
faithfully
keeping His
seventh day Sabbath, and they have the testimony of Jesus, the spirit
of
prophecy. They are preaching
the
everlasting gospel (Rev. 14:6-12), but the 9 Commandment Protestants
are not, because when you will not hear the law of God, neither will
you tolerate the straight testimony of a prophet of God calling for
repentance and obedience:</blockquote>
