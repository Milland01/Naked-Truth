  <p align="center"><b><font size="5">2 Thessalonians 3:6 and Catholic Tradition</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 3:6 (NRSV) Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord 
    Jesus Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not 
    according to the tradition that they received from us.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Well, there you have it, proof that Paul taught the doctrinal oral 
  Traditions of the Catholic Church! Right?? When this verse is cited as a proof 
  text in support of oral Tradition by Catholics, the chances are slim to none 
  that they will examine and explain the context of this verse. What is Paul 
  really teaching, when context is taken into account? Let's let Paul explain:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 3:7 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not 
    idle when we were with you,<br>
    2 Th 3:8 and we did not eat anyone's bread without paying for it; but with 
    toil and labor we worked night and day, so that we might not burden any of 
    you.<br>
    2 Th 3:9 This was not because we do not have that right, but in order to 
    give you an example to imitate.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul is reminding the Thessalonians that when he was with them, he did not 
  accept gifts or charity from church members, but paid a fair price for even 
  his meals. He did this even though he was entitled, as a preacher of the 
  gospel, to have the church supply his room and board. Paul goes on to explain 
  why he was doing this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 3:10 For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: 
    Anyone unwilling to work should not eat.<br>
    2 Th 3:11 For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere 
    busybodies, not doing any work.<br>
    2 Th 3:12 Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to 
    do their work quietly and to earn their own living.<br>
    2 Th 3:13 Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the previous chapter of his epistle, Paul warned about those who were 
  teaching that the second coming was imminent (2 Thes. 2:2), and this had 
  apparently misled some in Thessalonica into ceasing from earning a living, 
  since they expected the Lord to return at any moment. Paul made it quite clear 
  in chapter 2 that such teaching was in error, and he details events that must 
  first take place before Christ could return (2 Thes. 2:3-12). This is why Paul 
  did not live off the resources of the church in Thessalonica, because he was 
  setting an example, to reinforce his teaching that the second coming was not 
  near (v. 9 above).</p>
  <p>Paul now restates and enlarges on what he said in verse 6: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 3:14 Take note of those who do not obey what we say in this letter; 
    have nothing to do with them, so that they may be ashamed.<br>
    2 Th 3:15 Do not regard them as enemies, but warn them as believers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paul was reminding the Thessalonians of how he conducted himself when he 
  was with them; he was self-supporting,&nbsp;working diligently to be 
  productive and earn an income to pay his own way, and this, in context, is the
  <i>tradition</i> Paul speaks of in verse 6, that is in contrast to the 
  idleness of some:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Th 3:6 Now we command you, beloved, in the name of our Lord Jesus 
    Christ, to keep away from believers who are living in idleness and not 
    according to the tradition that they received from us.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The very same principle is taught in the parable of the idle servant (Matt. 
  25:14-30, Luke 19:11-27).</p>
  <p>So now, what of the alleged support for Catholic Tradition in 2 Th 3:6? 
  Clearly when the verse is examined <i>in context</i>, that support simply 
  evaporates before your eyes!</p>
