  <p><b>The Empire of Persia</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:1 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I,
stood to confirm and to strengthen him.<br>
Dan 11:2 And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than
they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all
against the realm of Grecia.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The Empire of Greece (Alexander the Great)</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with
great dominion, and do according to his will.<br>
Dan 11:4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his
posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his
kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The Empire of Pagan Imperial Rome</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own
land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found [Julius Caesar].<br>
Dan 11:20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes [Caesar
Augustus, Lk. 2:1] in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he
shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.<br>
Dan 11:21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person [Tiberius
Caesar], to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he
shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.<br>
Dan 11:22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
before him [destruction of Jerusalem - Dan 9:26], and shall be broken;
yea, also the prince of the covenant [crucifixion of Christ].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Rise of Papal Rome, the Dark Ages and Crusader wars.</b><br>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:23 And after the league <i>made</i> with him he shall
work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a
small people. <br>
Dan 11:24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
province; and he shall do <i>that</i> which his fathers have not done,
nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and
spoil, and riches: <i>yea</i>, and he shall forecast his devices
against the strong holds, even for a time. <br>
Dan 11:25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the
king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be
stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall
not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him. <br>
Dan 11:26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain. <br>
Dan 11:27 And both these kings' hearts <i>shall be</i> to do mischief,
and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for
yet the end <i>shall be</i> at the time appointed. <br>
Dan 11:28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
heart <i>shall be</i> against the holy covenant; and he shall do <i>exploits</i>,
and return to his own land. <br>
Dan 11:29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Papal Rome: Apostasy, Paganism and Idolatry enter the Christian
Church:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him:
therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation
against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and
have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant [papal Rome].<br>
Dan 11:31 And arms [state militaries] shall stand on his [the papacy]
part [An early example: Christian Emperor Justinian's general
Belisarius vanquishes the
foes of the papacy], and they [Eastern and Western Christianity] shall
pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the <strike>daily
    <i>sacrifice</i></strike><i> </i> perpetual<i> covenant </i>[Sabbath],
and they shall place the <a href="abomination-of-desolation.html">abomination
that maketh desolate</a> [Sunday].<br>
Dan 11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong,
and do <i> exploits</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Yet the Gospel is Proclaimed During Persecution:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:33 And they that understand among the people shall
instruct many [the Gospel commission to the church - Matt. 28:19]: yet
they shall fall by the sword, and by flame [burning at the stake], by
captivity [imprisonment], and by spoil [property confiscation], many
days [persecution during the 1260 days/years of Dan. 7:25; 12:7 and
Rev. 12:6,14; 13:5 - 538 A.D. to 1798 A.D.].<br>
Dan 11:34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries [apostasy enters
the church, v. 32].<br>
Dan 11:35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them,
and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end [1798
A.D.]: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The Antichrist Little Horn Power Prospers in Apostasy:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:36 And the king [Antichrist / little horn / papacy] shall
do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify
himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the
God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished:
for that that is determined shall be done. [see Dan. 7:8,25, 8:9-11,
Rev. 13:3-7]<br>
Dan 11:37 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers [God the
Father], nor the desire of women [to give birth to the Messiah, i.e.,
God the Son], nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above
all [blasphemy].<br>
Dan 11:38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces [civil
state power]: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with
gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things [gross
idolatry].<br>
Dan 11:39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god
[See Rev. 17:2], whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and
he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for
gain.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Apparent Successes of King of the North End in Final Defeat.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 11:40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south
push at him [King of the North]: and the king of the north shall come
against him [King of the South] like a whirlwind, with chariots, and
with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the
countries, and shall overflow and pass over.<br>
Dan 11:41 He [King of the North] shall enter also into the glorious
land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape
out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of
Ammon.<br>
Dan 11:42 He [King of the North] shall stretch forth his hand also upon
the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.<br>
Dan 11:43 But he [King of the North] shall have power over the
treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of
Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.<br>
Dan 11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall
trouble him: therefore he [King of the North] shall go forth
[retaliate] with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.<br>
Dan 11:45 And he [King of the north or Antichrist / little horn] shall
plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious
holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him
[the seventh plague].</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Antichrist / little horn power in Daniel and Revelation is
without any doubt the papacy of the Roman Catholic Church, the
Vatican.&nbsp; The "god whom his fathers knew not" is Catholic worship
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, promoted today as Co-redeemer and Mediatrix
of all graces, idolatrous statues of which are honored "with gold, and
silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things". The willful
king of verse 36 is presumably called the King of the North in verses
40-45 [Antichrist / little horn / papacy], who gains increased power
and influence in the world. However, the King of the North is angered
by a message from the east and the north. The message from the east may
refer to Revelation 7:2-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 7:2 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having
the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four
angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,<br>
Rev 7:3 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The tidings from the north in verse may refer to mount Zion:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is
mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the tidings that anger the King of the North would be the
outpouring of the latter rain of the Holy Spirit on those proclaiming
the gospel message of the 3 angels in Revelation 14, and the angel in
Revelation 18. The planting of the tabernacles of his palace would be
the combining of church (tabernacle) and state (palace), with the
resulting death decree for non-compliance with the mark of the beast
(Rev. 13:15). This effort ultimately ends in disastrous defeat for the
King of the North (Rev. 17:16)</p>

    <p>Dan 12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the
book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
knowledge shall be increased.<br>
Dan 12:5 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the
one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side
of the bank of the river.<br>
Dan 12:6 And <i>one</i> said to the man clothed in linen, which was
upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these
wonders?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>A Partial Answer [regarding Event #1]:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon
the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left
hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall
be for a time, times, and an half [1260 days]; and when he [God the
Father] shall have accomplished to scatter [distribute] the power
[latter rain] of the holy people, all these things [testing / martyrdom
of God's people] shall be finished [the close of probation].</p>

    <p>Dan 12:8 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my
Lord, what shall be the end of these things?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>The Second Answer [regarding Event #2] to Daniel's Question:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 12:9 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are
closed up and sealed till the time of the end.<br>
Dan 12:10 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; [the
144,000] but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall

also Dan 9:2 and Dan 9:27], there shall be a thousand two hundred and
ninety days [to the Special Resurrection and Glorification of the

  <p><b>[Event #3] The General Resurrection of the Just [including
Daniel] at the Second Coming:</b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 12:12 <u>Blessed</u> is he that waiteth [from the Special
Resurrection], and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and
thirty days.<br>
Dan 12:13 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
stand in thy lot [be resurrected] at the end of the [1335] days. [1
Cor. 15:52]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note Revelation 14:13-14.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write,

Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their
works do follow them.<br>
Rev 14:14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown,
and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i>After</i> the 3 angels' messages of Rev. 14 are proclaimed, a
special group of people who have died are described as blessed. The
next event, in verse 14, is the second coming. This blessed group of
people, the proclaimers of the 3 angels' messages, are the same
mentioned as resurrected in the special resurrection of Dan. 12:2-3,
which happens at the 1290th day. Daniel 12:12 is saying this blessed
group are given the privilege of witnessing events that lead up to and
include the general resurrection at the second coming on the 1335th day.</p>

    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Scriptures are presented
truths that relate especially to our own time. To the period just prior
to the appearing of the Son of man, the prophecies of Scripture point,
and here their warnings and threatenings pre-eminently apply. <u>The
prophetic periods of Daniel, extending to the very eve of the great
consummation</u>, throw a flood of light upon events then to transpire.
The book of Revelation is also replete with warning and instruction for
the last generation. The beloved John, under the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit, portrays the fearful and thrilling scenes connected with
the close of earth's history, and presents the duties and dangers of
God's people. None need remain in ignorance, none need be unprepared
for the coming of the day of God. (<b><a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last days Satan will appear as an angel
of light, with great power and heavenly glory, and claim to be the Lord
of the whole earth. He will declare that the Sabbath has been changed
from the seventh to the first day of the week; and as lord of the first
day of the week he will present this spurious sabbath as a test of
loyalty to him. <u>Then will take place the final fulfillment of the
Revelator's prophecy. [Rev. 13:4-18, quoted.]</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection with this scripture, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Revelation should be studied much by God's
people. Verses nine to eleven bring to view the special message of
warning against worshiping the beast and his image, and receiving his
mark in the forehead or in the hand. This warning is to be given to the
world by those who are mentioned in the twelfth verse as keeping "the
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."{<b><a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing will certainly be understood from the
study of Revelation--that the connection between God and His people is
close and decided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wonderful connection is
seen between the universe of heaven and this world. The things revealed
to Daniel were afterward complemented by the revelation made to John on
the Isle of Patmos. These two books should be carefully studied. <u>Twice
Daniel inquired, How long shall it be to the end of time?</u>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I heard, but I understood not:
then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And He
said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till
the time of the end. Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried;
but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
understand; but the wise shall understand. And from the time that the
daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh
desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred
and five and thirty days. But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou
shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days." [Dan 12:8-13]</p>
    </blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the Lion of the tribe of Judah who
unsealed the book and gave to John the revelation of what should be in
these last days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel stood in his lot to
bear his testimony which was sealed until the time of the end, when the
first angel's message should be proclaimed to our world. These matters
are of infinite importance in these last days; but while "many shall be
purified, and made white, and tried," "the wicked shall do wickedly:
and none of the wicked shall understand." How true this is! Sin is the
transgression of the law of God; and those who will not accept the
light in regard to the law of God will not understand the proclamation
of the first, second, and third angel's messages. <u>The book of
Daniel is unsealed in the revelation to John, and carries us forward to

&nbsp; When ye therefore shall see <u>the abomination of desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet [Dan 12:11]</u>, stand in the holy
place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in
Judaea flee into the mountains. Matt. 24:15, 16. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time is not far distant, when, like the
early disciples, we shall be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and
solitary places. As the siege of Jerusalem by the Roman armies was the
signal for flight to the Judean Christians, so the assumption of power
on the part of our nation [the United States] <u>in the decree
enforcing the papal sabbath will be a warning to us</u>. It will then
be time to leave the large cities, preparatory to leaving the smaller
ones for retired homes in secluded places among the mountains. {<b><a

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the approach of the Roman armies was
a sign to the disciples of the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so
may this apostasy be a sign to us that the limit of God's forbearance
is reached, that the measure of our nation's iniquity is full, and that
the angel of mercy is about to take her flight, never to return. The
people of God will then be plunged into those scenes of affliction and
distress which prophets have described as the time of Jacob's trouble.
The cries of the faithful, persecuted ones ascend to heaven. And as the
blood of Abel cried from the ground, there are voices also crying to
God from martyrs' graves, from the sepulchers of the sea, from mountain
caverns, from convent vaults: "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost
Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" {<b><a

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Saviour's prophecy concerning the
visitation of judgments upon Jerusalem is to have another fulfillment,
of which that terrible desolation was but a faint shadow. In the fate
of the chosen city we may behold the doom of a world that has rejected
God's mercy and trampled upon His law. Dark are the records of human
misery that earth has witnessed during its long centuries of crime. The
heart sickens, and the mind grows faint in contemplation. Terrible have
been the results of rejecting the authority of Heaven. But a scene yet
darker is presented in the revelations of the future. {<b><a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After speaking of the end of the world, Jesus
comes back to Jerusalem, the city then sitting in pride and&nbsp;
arrogance, and saying, "I sit a queen, and shall see no sorrow" (see
Rev. 18:7). As His prophetic eye rests upon Jerusalem, He sees that as
she was given up to destruction, the world will be given up to its
doom. The scenes that transpired at the destruction of Jerusalem will
be repeated at the great and terrible day of the Lord, but in a more
fearful manner. . . . {<b><a

  <p align="left">The above quotes indicate that both Daniel 11 and 12
were still <u>unfulfilled</u> in 1904, and therefore were not fully
understood. That leads me to believe that Daniel 11 and 12 (combined)
give a <u>continuous chronological history of events</u> that end with
the second coming, therefore the 1260, 1290 and 1335 days in Daniel 12
are assumed to be literal days, not symbolic of years, and relate
directly to events immediately prior to the second coming, as described
in Daniel 12.</p>
  <p align="left">However, the following quote of Ellen White is often
presented as proof that the time prophecies of Daniel 12 are already
fulfilled:</p>
  <font face="Arial" size="4"><i>
  <p align="center">SDA Commentary, Vol. 7, pg. 971<br>
Revelation Chapter 10</p>
  </i></font>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1–11 (ch. 14:6–12; Dan. 12:4–13). No Less a Person
Than Christ.—The mighty angel who instructed John was no less a
personage than Jesus Christ. Setting His right foot on the sea, and His
left upon the dry land, shows the part which He is acting in the
closing scenes of the great controversy with Satan. This position
denotes His supreme power and authority over the whole earth. The
controversy has waxed stronger and more determined from age to age, and
will continue to do so, to the concluding scenes when the masterly
working of the powers of darkness shall reach their height. Satan,
united with evil men, will deceive the whole world and the churches who
receive not the love of the truth. But the mighty angel demands
attention. He cries with a loud voice. He is to show the power and
authority of His voice to those who have united with Satan to oppose
the truth.</p>
    <p>After these seven thunders uttered their voices, the injunction
comes to John as to Daniel in regard to the little book: "Seal up those
things which the seven thunders uttered." These relate to future events
which will be disclosed in their order. Daniel shall stand in his lot
at the end of the days. John sees the little book unsealed. Then <u>Daniel’s
prophecies have their proper place in the first, second, and third
angels’ messages to be given to the world. the unsealing of the little
book was the message in relation to time.</u></p>
    <p align="left">The books of Daniel and the Revelation are one. One
is a prophecy, the other a revelation; one a book sealed, the other a
book opened. John heard the mysteries which the thunders uttered, but
he was commanded not to write them.</p>
    <p align="left">The special light given to John which was expressed
in the seven thunders was a delineation of events which would transpire
under the first and second angels’ messages. It was not best for the
people to know these things, for their faith must necessarily be
tested. In the order of God most wonderful and advanced truths would be
proclaimed. The first and second angels’ messages were to be
proclaimed, but no further light was to be revealed before these
messages had done their specific work. This is represented by the angel
standing with one foot on the sea, proclaiming with a most solemn oath
that time should be no longer.</p>
    <p align="left">This time, which the angel declares with a solemn
oath, is not the end of this world’s history, neither of probationary
time, but of prophetic time, which should precede the advent of our
Lord. That is, <u>the people will not have another message upon
definite time. After this period of time, reaching from 1842 to 1844,
there can be no definite tracing of the prophetic time.</u> The longest
reckoning reaches to the autumn of 1844.</p>
    <p>The angel’s position, with one foot on the sea, the other on the
land, signifies the wide extent of the proclamation of the message. It
will cross the broad waters and be proclaimed in other countries, even
to all the world. The comprehension of truth, the glad reception of the
message, is represented in the eating of the little book. The truth in
regard to the time of the advent of our Lord was a precious message to
our souls (MS 59, 1900).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This commentary is regarding Revelation 10, in particular:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 10:6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who
created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the
things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein,
that there should be time no longer:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I would propose that should be interpreted as "that there should
be [prophetic] time no longer", meaning that the day for a year
principle of prophetic time ends with the 2300 years in 1844, and that
the time periods of Daniel 12 are therefore <i>literal</i> days, which
as Ellen White says above - <u>"Daniel’s prophecies have their proper
place in the first, second, and third angels’ messages to be given to
the world. the unsealing of the little book was the message in relation
to time."</u> In other words, Daniel 11 and 12 are only understood and
fulfilled as literal days when the 3 angel's messages are being
proclaimed, which is <u>after</u> 1844.</p>
  <p>There is precedence for time prophecies that do not use the day
for a year principle. Examples are the 70 year prophecy of Jeremiah
25:11-12, and 29:10, and the 7 times of Daniel 4:16, 23, 25, and 32.</p>
  <p>Ellen White in <i>Great Controversy </i>gives details of end
time events that I believe support the conclusion that the time
prophecies of Daniel 12 are literal days and yet future.</p>
  <p><u>OBSERVATIONS and QUESTIONS</u></p>
  <p>The purpose of recognizing the abomination of desolation is that
it signals a very urgent message to Christians to flee the cities for
the remote uninhabited areas, to avoid the imminent crisis of violence
and destruction in the densely populated wicked cities. </p>
  <p>Ellen White never explicitly defined or applied the time
prophecies of Daniel 12, and in 1910 stated flatly that she had not
been given any light on the "daily" of Daniel 8. </p>
  <p>Ellen White mentions only 2 fulfillments of the abomination of
desolation. The first was the siege of Jerusalem in 70 A.D., which was
a "faint shadow" of the second or antitypical fulfillment, the decree
of a national Sunday law by the U.S. government. She makes absolutely
no mention of Clovis or 508 A.D.</p>
  <p>To accept the 1290 day prophecy in Dan 12:11 as ending in 1798
A.D. is to say that Daniel <i>never</i> mentions the major antitypical
fulfillment of the abomination of desolation immediately prior to the
close of probation (Dan. 12:1), and that Daniel <i>never</i> says
anything further about "times and laws" introduced in Dan 7:25,
although chapters 8 and 11 repeat and enlarge on chapter 7. Instead, it
applies Dan. 12:11 to 508 A.D. I ask, if this is so, just who heeded
the warning to flee the cities to escape the imminent violence and
destruction in 508, as happened in 70 A.D.? Why would the conversion of
this rather obscure French King be the intended fulfillment and not the
major fulfillment so clearly explained by Ellen White?</p>
