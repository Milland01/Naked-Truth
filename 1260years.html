the Roman Pontiffs belongs to the past, that the head of the Church must under 
heaven depend for its maintenance upon the generosity of his spiritual children 
throughout the world, that <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">a usurper holds the throne from which the Pope ruled 
for a thousand years,</span> while its rightful owner is a prisoner in his own city, it 
will be of interest from many points of view to review what Roman people and 
Rome were like before 1870 and what they are to-day.</p>

<p class="gtxt_body" style="text-indent: 1em">Long ages ago, when Rome through 
the neglect of the Western emperors was left to the mercy of barbarous hordes, 
Romans turned to one figure for aid and protection and asked him to rule them; 
and thus in this simple manner, the best title of all to kingly right, commenced 
the temporal sovereignty of the Popes. <span class="gstxt_hlt">And meekly 
stepping to the throne of Caesar, </span>the Vicar of Christ took up the sceptre 
to which the emperors and kings of Europe were to bow in reverence through so 
many ages, from sentiments of respect for the dignity of his office and because 
he was the only mediator whom they recognized in their almost interminable wars.</p>

    Revelations</i>, were names which <i>God himself </i>had given to the Pope;

    <i>consistency</i> of these revilers of the Catholic religion:
    <font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;they will not, because they cannot, deny, that 
    this religion was the ONLY CHRISTIAN religion in the world for <i>fifteen

    then, for <i><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">twelve hundred years</span></i><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF"> </span>
    there had been; and, during that period, all the nations of Europe, and some

    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the abandonment of Rome [*] was the 
    liberation of the Pontiffs. Whatsoever claims to obedience the Emperors may 
    have made, and whatsoever compliance the Pontiff may have yielded, the whole 
    previous relation, anomalous, and annulled again and again by the vices and 
    outrages of the Emperors, was finally dissolved by a higher power. The 
    providence of God permitted a succession of irruptions, Gothic, Lombard, and 
    Hungarian, to desolate Italy, and to efface from it every remnant of</p>
    <p align="left" class="auto-style1">* Emperor Constantine left Rome in 326 
	A.D. in search of a suitable new capital, and dedicated Byzantium as the 
	&quot;Nova Roma&quot; on May 11th, 330 A.D., renaming it Constantinople after himself.</p>
	  <p align="left">
	  <a href="Sources/Temporal-preface-28-29.gif">
    [xxix]</a></p>
    <p align="left">the Empire. The Pontiffs found themselves alone; the sole 
    fountains of order, peace, law, and safety. And from the hour of this 
    providential liberation, when, by a Divine intervention, the chains fell off 
    from the hands of the successor of St. Peter, as once before from his own, 
    no sovereign has ever reigned in Rome except the Vicar of Jesus Christ.. The 
    moral import of this Divine action must be adequately appreciated. It 
    cancelled, abolished, and extinguished finally and for ever the right of 
    conquest, possession, occupation, and property claimed by the Emperors over 
    Italy and Rome.</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="Sources/Temporal-11.gif">[pg. 
    11]</a></p>
    <p align="left">For three hundred years, then, the Church had over it, in 
    Rome itself, a temporal power, to which it rendered obedience in all things 
    that were lawful. In this it only obeyed the precept, &quot;Render unto Caesar 
    the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But from the hour when Constantine, in 
    the language of the Roman law, &quot;Deo jubente,&quot; by the command of God, 
    translated the seat of empire to Constantinople, from that moment there 
    never reigned</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="Sources/Temporal-12-13.gif">
    [pg. 12]</a></p>
    <p align="left">in Rome a temporal prince to whom the Bishops of Rome owed a 
    permanent allegiance. From that hour God Himself liberated His Church. ... 
    It waited until such time as God should break its bonds asunder, and should 
    liberate it from subjection to civil powers, and enthrone it in the 
    possession of a <span class="gstxt_hlt">temporal </span>sovereignty of its 
    own. 
    Therefore, in that day when the first Christian emperor withdrew himself 
    into the far East, he abandoned Rome and Italy; and the &quot;donation&quot; of 
    Constantine, as it is called, expresses not a fact, but a principle. 
    Constantine signed no instrument of donation; but the manner of conceiving 
    and of speaking, in those simple ages, so represented the provi-</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="Sources/Temporal-12-13.gif">
    [pg. 13]</a></p>
    <p align="left">dential fact of the donation of God. God gave to the Vicar 
    of His Son the possession of the city in which thirty of his predecessors 
    has sealed their testimony with their blood. The donation of Constantine 
    consisted in the simple providential fact, that he departed from Rome to 
    Constantinople, moved by an impulse from God himself. It would delay me too 
    long to dwell upon the motives which God implanted in the first Christian 
    emperor, to impel him to abandon his sovereignty in Rome. They were motives 
    of a supernatural origin, and he was but obeying a supernatural impulse. The 
    donation was of God, and not of man. ...</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="Sources/Temporal-16-17.gif">
    [pg. 16]</a></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say, then, that it was God's own act 
    which liberated His Vicar upon earth from subjection to temporal power; and 
    that <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">for twelve hundred years the 
    Bishops of Rome have reigned as temporal princes.</span> They have possessed 
    their own. No man has given to them their sovereign rights. They reign there

    material power which once reigned in Rome consecrated and sanctified by the

    taken up of old, perpetuated, preserved, and as I have said, by the salt

    was clothed with the prerogatives of a true and proper local sovereignty 
    over that state and territory and people so committed to his charge. From 
    that hour, which I might say was fifteen hundred years ago, or, to speak

  <p align="left">Take special note that Manning, who became a prince of the 
  Roman Catholic Church, admits a twelve century rule by the Bishop of Rome, a 
  twelve century period of temporal papal supremacy, that was well established 
  by the seventh century. </p>
  <p align="left">In prophecy days are symbolic of years. The 70 weeks of Daniel 
  9:24 being the most commonly known example. Seventy weeks is 490 days, but

  prophetically to a period of 1260 years of apostasy prevailing in the church:</p>
  <p align="left"><u><b><font size="4">1260 Days</font></b></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 11:3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and 
    they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in 
    sackcloth.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The two witnesses is a reference to the law and the 
    prophets, the word of God. For 1260 years scriptural truth would be 
    suppressed, obscured by the traditions of men.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she 
    hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two 
    hundred and threescore days.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The true church would flee persecution by the apostate 
    church, and be sustained by God for 1260 years.</p>
    <p align="left"><u><b><font size="4">42 Months</font></b></u></p>
    <p align="left">This period of 1260 days is also spoken of as 42 months:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 11:2 But the court which is without the temple leave 
    out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy 
    city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The apostate church is referred to here as Gentiles, who 
    will be dominant for 1260 years. Their judgment is to be delayed (measure 
    not), not to be done until after the true church (temple of God, and the 
    altar, and them that worship therein, v. 1) is judged in the pre-advent 
    judgment.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 13:5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great 
    things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and 
    two months.<br>
    Rev 13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his 
    name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.<br>
    Rev 13:7 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to 
    overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and 
    nations.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Blasphemy and persecution characterize the 1260 years of 
    dominion of the apostate church.</p>
    <p align="left"><u><b><font size="4">3 1/2 Times</font></b></u></p>
  <p align="left">The 1260 days are also referred to as 3 1/2 times:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Dan 7:25 And he shall speak great words against the most 
    High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change 
    times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times 
    and the dividing of time.</p>
    <p align="left">Dan 12:7 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was 
    upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left 
    hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for 
    a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter 
    the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</p>
    <p align="left">Rev 12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great 
    eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is 
    nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the 
    serpent.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Again, these verses describe 1260 years of blasphemy, 
    persecution, and apostasy, through which the true church would persevere and 
    emerge from the wilderness at the conclusion of 1260 years.</p>

  and exiled

  installed <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15427b.htm">Vigilius</a>, a 
  confidant of Empress Theodora, as the Bishop of Rome in March of 537. In quick 
  reply, the Ostrogoths rallied and laid siege to Rome. When the siege was 
  finally broken by General Belisarius in March of 538, the Ostrogoths withdrew 
  from Rome in defeat, leaving it in the Emperor's&nbsp;control, and Vigilius as the 
  Bishop of Rome (who reigned until 555 A.D.). So it was in 538 A.D. that

  <blockquote>
    <p>La Chiesa Cattolica fondata e istituita da Cristo Signore per provvedere 
    alla salvezza eterna degli uomini, avendo conseguito, in forza della sua 
    divina istituzione, la forma di società perfetta, deve godere, 
    nell’esercizio del suo sacro ministero, di quella libertà che la sottrae 
    alla soggezione di qualsivoglia potere civile.</p>
    <p>Poiché per operare liberamente, come era necessario, doveva fruire di 
    quei supporti che rispondevano alle condizioni e alle esigenze dei tempi, 
    per una speciale disposizione della divina Provvidenza avvenne che, quando 
    l’Impero Romano si dissolse e fu diviso in vari regni, il Romano Pontefice, 
    costituito da Cristo capo e centro di tutta la Chiesa, ottenne un Principato 
    civile.</p>
    <p>Questo fu disposto con somma sapienza da Dio stesso, perché in mezzo ad 
    una tale moltitudine e varietà di sovrani temporali, il Sommo Pontefice 
    disponesse di quella libertà politica che era indispensabile per esercitare, 
    senza alcun impedimento, il suo potere spirituale, la sua autorità e la sua 
    giurisdizione sul mondo intero. <font face="Times New Roman">&#8722;

    <p align="left">The Catholic Church which was founded and instituted by Our 
    Lord Jesus Christ to procure the eternal salvation of men, has, by reason of 
    this divine institution, the form of a perfect society. Therefore, she must 
    possess liberty such that she cannot be subject to any civil power in the 
    execution of her sacred ministry. </p>
    <p align="left">To act with freedom, as it is just she should, she has 
    always needed the assistance which was suitable to the conditions and the 
    necessities of the age. It is, therefore, by a particular decree of Divine 
    Providence that, at the fall of the Roman Empire and its partition into 
    separate kingdoms, the Roman Pontiff, whom Christ made the head and center 
    of his entire Church, acquired civil power.</p>
    <p align="left">Certainly, it was by a most wise design of God Himself that 
    in the midst of so great a multitude and variety of temporal princes, the 
    Sovereign Pontiff enjoyed political liberty, which is so necessary for him 
    to exercise his spiritual power, his authority, and his jurisdiction over 
    the whole world.</p>

  <p align="left">The &quot;head wound&quot; to papal power was inflicted in 1798 when 
  General Berthier of France captured Pope Pius VI, who soon died in captivity 
  in Valence, on August 29, 1799.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">... when the French general L. Duphot was killed in a riot 
    in Rome the Directory ordered the occupation of the papal states. On 15 Feb. 
    1798 General Louis Berthier entered Rome, proclaimed the Roman Republic and 
    the deposition of Pius as head of state, and forced him to withdraw to 
    Tuscany. For several months he lived at the charterhouse at Florence, cut 
    off from almost all his advisers, but able to use the nuncio to Florence as 
    secretary of state. The Directory planned to banish him to Sardinia, but his 
    precarious health ruled that out. When war broke out afresh, fearful of 
    attempts to rescue him, it had him conveyed from Florence (28 Mar. 1799) via 
    Turin across the Alps to Briancon (30 Apr.) and then Valence (13 July). He 
    died a prisoner in the citadel there, and was buried in the local cemetery; 
    his body was then transferred to St. Peter's, in Rome, in Feb. 1802.</p>

    EXTINCTION OF THE PAPACY<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of the French directory was the destruction of the 
    pontifical government, as the irreconcilable enemy of the republic. They 
    urged their general to drive the pope and cardinals out of Rome. Bonaparte 
    proposed to give the Eternal City to the King of Spain, on condition of his 
    recognizing the French republic. Failing in this, he resorted to a system of 
    pillage which exhausted its resources, and finally a democratical 
    demonstration was got up at Rome in the accustomed manner, in which one of 
    the French envoys was killed by the fire of pontifical troops. This 
    misfortune afforded the desired pretext. The French army pouring in under 
    Berthier planted the tri-color on the Capitol, while their Roman 
    confederates displaying the famous insignia, S. P. Q. R., shouted for 
    liberty. The aged pope [Pius VI] was summoned to surrender the temporal 
    government; on his refusal, he was dragged from the altar, and the soldiers 
    plundered the Vatican in presence of its owner. They stripped his own 
    chamber: when he asked to be left to die in peace, he was brutally answered 
    that any place would serve to die in. His rings were torn from his fingers, 
    and finally, after declaring the temporal power abolished, the victors

    DECLINE AND FALL OF THE PAPACY<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Papal States, converted into the <i>Roman Republic,</i> 
    were declared to be in perpetual alliance with France, but the French 
    general was the real master at Rome. The citizens groaned under his terrible 
    exactions, Churches, convents, palaces, were stripped to the bare walls. The 
    works of art were all carried off. The territorial possessions of the 
    clergy and monks were declared national property, and their former owners 
    cast into prison. The papacy was extinct: not a vestige of its existence 
    remained; and among all the Roman Catholic powers not a finger was stirred 
    in its defence. The Eternal City had no longer prince or pontiff; its 
    bishop was a dying captive in foreign lands; and the decree was already 
    announced that no successor would be allowed in his place.</p>
