  <p align="center"><b>Twelfth Ecumenical Council: Lateran IV - 1215 A.D</b>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(NOTE: for the convenience of the reader I have added boldface
    subheadings and in some cases paragraph breaks which do not appear in the
    original text.)</p>
    <p>CANON 3:&nbsp;
    <h5>ON CHURCH USE OF SECULAR AUTHORITIES TO DEAL WITH HERETICS</h5>
    <p>We excommunicate and anathematize every heresy that raises against the
    holy, orthodox and Catholic faith which we have above explained; condemning
    all heretics under whatever names they may be known, for while they have
    different faces they are nevertheless bound to each other by their tails,
    since in all of them vanity is a common element. Those condemned, being
    handed over to the secular rulers of their bailiffs, let them be abandoned,
    to be punished with due justice, clerics being first degraded from their
    orders. As to the property of the condemned, if they are laymen, let it be
    confiscated; if clerics, let it be applied to the churches from which they
    received revenues. But those who are only suspected, due consideration being
    given to the nature of the suspicion and the character of the person, unless
    they prove their innocence by a proper defense, let them be anathematized
    and avoided by all until they have made suitable satisfaction; but if they
    have been under excommunication for one year, then let them be condemned as
    heretics.
    <h5>ON INSURING SECULAR AUTHORITIES EXTERMINATE HERETICS</h5>
    <p>Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished
    and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, that as
    they wish to be esteemed and numbered among the faithful, so for the defense
    of the faith they ought publicly to take an oath that they will strive in
    good faith and to the best of their ability to exterminate in the
    territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the
    Church; so that whenever anyone shall have assumed authority, whether
    spiritual or temporal, let him be bound to confirm this decree by oath.
    <h5>ON SEIZING THE TERRITORY OF UNRESPONSIVE SECULAR RULERS</h5>
    <p>But if a temporal ruler, after having been requested and admonished by
    the Church, should neglect to cleanse his territory of this heretical
    foulness, let him be excommunicated by the metropolitan and the other
    bishops of the province. If he refuses to make satisfaction within a year,
    let the matter be made known to the supreme pontiff, that he may declare the
    ruler's vassals absolved from their allegiance and may offer the territory
    to be ruled by Catholics, who on the extermination of the heretics may
    possess it without hindrance and preserve it in the purity of faith; the
    right, however, of the chief ruler is to be respected as long as he offers
    no obstacle in this matter and permits freedom of action. The same law is to
    be observed in regard to those who have no chief rulers (that is, are
    independent). Catholics who have girded themselves with the cross for the
    extermination of the heretics, shall enjoy the indulgences and privileges
    granted to those who go in defense of the Holy Land.
    <h5>ON THE SUSPENSION OF RIGHTS FOR EXCOMMUNICATED HERETICS</h5>
    <p>We decree that those who give credence to the teachings of the heretics,
    as well as those who receive, defend, and patronize them, are
    excommunicated; and we firmly declare that after any one of them has been
    branded with excommunication, if he has deliberately failed to make
    satisfaction within a year, let him incur ipso jure the stigma of infamy and
    let him not be admitted to public offices or deliberations, and let him not
    take part in the election of others to such offices or use his right to give
    testimony in a court of law. Let him also be intestable, that he may not
    have the free exercise of making a will, and let him be deprived of the
    right of inheritance. Let no one be urged to give an account to him in any
    matter, but let him be urged to give an account to others. If perchance he
    be a judge, let his decisions have no force, nor let any cause be brought to
    his attention. If he be an advocate, let his assistance by no means be
    sought. If a notary, let the instruments drawn up by him be considered
    worthless, for, the author being condemned, let them enjoy a similar fate.
    In all similar cases we command that the same be observed. If, however, he
    be a cleric, let him be deposed from every office and benefice, that the
    greater the fault the graver may be the punishment inflicted.
    <p>If any refuse to avoid such after they have been ostracized by the
    Church, let them be excommunicated till they have made suitable
    satisfaction. Clerics shall not give the sacraments of the Church to such
    pestilential people, nor shall they presume to give them Christian burial,
    or to receive their alms or offerings; otherwise they shall be deprived of
    their office, to which they may not be restored without a special indult of
    the Apostolic See. Similarly, all regulars, on whom also this punishment may
    be imposed, let their privileges be nullified in that diocese in which they
    have presumed to perpetrate such excesses.
    <h5>ON FORBIDDING HERETICS TO PREACH</h5>
    <p>But since some, under &quot;the appearance of godliness, but denying the
    power thereof,&quot; as the Apostle says (II Tim. 3: 5), arrogate to
    themselves the authority to preach, as the same Apostle says: &quot;How
    shall they preach unless they be sent?&quot; (Rom. 10:15), all those
    prohibited or not sent, who, without the authority of the Apostolic See or
    of the Catholic bishop of the locality, shall presume to usurp the office of
    preaching either publicly or privately, shall be excommunicated and unless
    they amend, and the sooner the better, they shall be visited with a further
    suitable penalty.
    <h5>ON DILIGENTLY SEEKING OUT HERETICS</h5>
    <p>We add, moreover, that every archbishop or bishop should himself or
    through his archdeacon or some other suitable persons, twice or at least
    once a year make the rounds of his diocese in which report has it that
    heretics dwell, and there compel three or more men of good character or, if
    it should be deemed advisable, the entire neighborhood, to swear that if
    anyone know of the presence there of heretics or others holding secret
    assemblies, or differing from the common way of the faithful in faith and
    morals, they will make them known to the bishop. The latter shall then call
    together before him those accused, who, if they do not purge themselves of
    the matter of which they are accused, or if after the rejection of their
    error they lapse into their former wickedness, shall be canonically
    punished. But if any of them by damnable obstinacy should disapprove of the
    oath and should perchance be unwilling to swear, from this very fact let
    them be regarded as heretics.
    <h5>A WARNING TO BISHOPS WHO TOLERATE HERETICS</h5>
    <p>We wish, therefore, and in virtue of obedience strictly command, that to
    carry out these instructions effectively the bishops exercise throughout
    their dioceses a scrupulous vigilance if they wish to escape canonical
    punishment. If from sufficient evidence it is apparent that a bishop is
    negligent or remiss in cleansing his diocese of the ferment of heretical
    wickedness, let him be deposed from the episcopal office and let another,
    who will and can confound heretical depravity, be substituted.
    <p>CANON 18:
    <h5>THE CHURCH TRIES TO WASH ITS HANDS</h5>
    <p>No cleric may pronounce a sentence of death, or execute such a sentence,
    or be present at its execution. If anyone in consequence of this prohibition
    (hujusmodi occasions statuti) should presume to inflict damage on churches
    or injury on ecclesiastical persons, let him be restrained by ecclesiastical
    censure. Nor may any cleric write or dictate letters destined for the
    execution of such a sentence. Wherefore, in the chanceries of the princes
    let this matter be committed to laymen and not to clerics. Neither may a
    cleric act as judge in the case of the Rotarrii, archers, or other men of
    this kind devoted to the shedding of blood. No subdeacon, deacon, or priest
    shall practice that part of surgery involving burning and cutting. Neither
    shall anyone in judicial tests or ordeals by hot or cold water or hot iron
    bestow any blessing; the earlier prohibitions in regard to dueling remain in
    force.

  attempt is being made to absolve the Church of any direct responsibility for
  the deaths of heretics, so that they may place the blame on malevolent civil
  (secular) authorities.
