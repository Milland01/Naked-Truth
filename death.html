<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">CNN's special
  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/29/us/to-heaven-and-back/index.html?iref=allsearch">
  To Heaven and Back</a> broadcast on December 1st, 2013, presented the accounts 
  of people who claimed to have post death experiences, that is to say that they 
  claimed to have died in a clinical sense, yet continued on consciously in 
  spirit form, to then leave their body and look back down as a witness to their 
  own death, listening to the conversations of doctors or others at the scene. 
  Then they relate various experiences in wonderful detail, such as feeling a 
  euphoric sense of peace, love and serenity, meeting awesome spirit beings, 
  proceeding along a brightly lit path in Paradise, and dancing joyfully in 
  celebration, and talking with none other than Jesus. But then for one reason 
  or another, their spirit returned to their recently deceased body, and they 
  are able to testify convincingly to their life after death experience.</p>
	<p align="left">Is this what the Bible teaches? Do people have an immortal 
	spirit that continues conscious life immediately after clinical death? While 
	that is sincerely believed by the vast majority of Christians, it is a lie 
	that was first told by Satan in the garden of Eden:</p>
	<p align="left" style="margin-left: 40px">Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall
not surely die:</p>
  <p align="center"><u><b><font color="#ff0000" size="5">The Serpent's

  <p class="auto-style1"><span><b>
  <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p6.htm">
  366</a></b> The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created 
  immediately by God - it is not &quot;produced&quot; by the parents - and also that it is 
  immortal: it does not perish when it separates from the body at death, and it 
  will be reunited with the body at the final Resurrection.<sup>235 &mdash;</sup></span>

  <p>Also on past television programs broadcast from the South Bend
Indiana based <nobr><img src="star.gif" height="12" width="16"> <b> <a
 href="http://www.lesea.com/">LeSEA</a> </b></nobr>(Lester Sumrall
Evangelistic Association) ministries, Steve Sumrall and Delron Shirley
also made the astounding statement that no one ever really dies, that
everyone lives forever, the righteous in heaven and the wicked in hell.
The late Lester Sumrall even taught this himself; that <em>every</em>
human being was given immortality by God, and will <em>never </em>die.
(Lester Sumrall was an ordained Assemblies of God minister.)</p>
  <p>Actually, this is a belief that is widely accepted by most of the
Christian community, but does the Bible teach eternal life
(immortality) for everyone, wicked and righteous alike? What does the
Bible <i>really</i> teach about death?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u><a name="THE FIRST LIE">THE
FIRST LIE</a> IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN</u></font></b></p>
    <p align="left">Gen 3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye
shall not surely die:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The first lie, told by Satan, assured Eve that she would not die.
But what had God warned Adam and Eve about eating from the tree of
knowledge?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof <u>thou
shalt surely die</u>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>O.K. Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, and were doomed to die.
But what about their souls, you might ask, the soul continues on after
death, right? Aren't Adam and Eve (their souls) in heaven now?</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>THE <a name="SOUL THAT SINS">SOUL
THAT SINS</a> SHALL DIE</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ezek 18:4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father,
so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
die.</p>
    <p>Ezek 18:20 The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</p>
    <p>Ezek 33:11 Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have
no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from
his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye
die, O house of Israel?</p>
    <p>Psa 22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship:
all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can
keep alive his own soul.</p>
    <p>Psa 33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear
him, upon them that hope in his mercy;<br>
Psa 33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
famine.</p>
    <p>Psa 56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not
thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the
light of the living?</p>
    <p>Psa 89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?
shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The soul dies? Yes! Nowhere does the Bible speak of humanity
possessing an innately immortal soul, but it plainly teaches that the
soul (person) that sins is destined to die. Adam and Eve don't have
bodiless souls in heaven, they both are dead in the grave. Death is the
result or penalty of sin-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rom 6:23 For <u>the wages of sin is death</u>; but the gift of
God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
    <p>John 3:16 <font color="#ff0000">For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not <u>perish</u>, but have everlasting life.</font></p>
    <p>John 3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life:
and <u>he that believeth not the Son shall not see life</u>; but the
wrath of God abideth on him.</p>
    <p>John 4:14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give
him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in
him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
    <p>1 John 5:12 He that hath the Son hath life; and <u>he that hath
not the Son of God hath not life.</u><br>
1 John 5:13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the
name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and
that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Eternal life will be the reward for those who are righteous, but
this is only given after judgment. The wicked will <i><b>not</b></i>
see eternal life, but eternal death, they will <i><b>not</b></i> have
life.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>THE SOUL - THE BREATH OF LIFE</u></font></b></p>
  <p>But, what of the soul? Just what is it?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
living soul.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A soul, as shown by this verse, has the spark / breath of life,
given by God. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest
away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.<br>
Psa 104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
renewest the face of the earth.</p>
    <p>(The word breath in verse 29 and spirit in verse 30 is H7307
ruwach)</p>
    <p>Eccl 12:7 <span style="line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0px;">Then
shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit (</span>H7307
ruwach / breath) <span style="line-height: 1.5em; text-indent: 0px;">shall
return unto God who gave it.</span> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When God breathed life into Adam, he <em>became </em>a living
soul (creature). Note that Gen. 2:7 does <em>not</em> say God put a
soul into Adam. You are a soul because God has breathed life into you.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Job 12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD
hath wrought this?<br>
Job 12:10 In whose hand is the <em>soul</em> of every living thing,
and the <em>breath</em> of all mankind.</p>
    <p>Job 27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God
is in my nostrils;</p>
    <p>1 Ki 17:17 And it came to pass after these things, that the son
of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
was so sore, that there was no <em>breath </em>left in him.</p>
    <p>1 Ki 17:21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times,
and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
child's <em> soul</em> come into him again.<br>
1 Ki 17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the <em>soul</em>
of the child came into him again, and he revived.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the above incident with Elijah, the return of the child's soul
and breath are identical in meaning. You do not have a ghost-like
immortal soul that survives your physical death. Life is what makes you
a soul. Without life you perish.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>EVERY SOUL IN THE SEA</u></font></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea;
and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in
the sea.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Notice that even the inhabitants of the sea are referred to as
living souls, just like Adam. This is because the soul is only the
spark of life, which is given by God alone. It is not a ghost living
inside you.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>THE RICH MAN WHO <em>LOST</em>
HIS SOUL</u></font></b></p>
  <p>Note the story of the rich man who thought he was set for a life
of leisure because his barns were full:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 12:20 <font color="#ff0000">But God said unto him, Thou
fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall
those things be, which thou hast provided?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The rich man's soul did not move to heaven that night, rather he
lost his life. He lost his soul and perished. He ceased to live, and
his goods then became the property of someone else. All of his planning
was worthless.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 16:25 <font color="#ff0000">For whosoever will save his
life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall
find it.</font><br>
Mat 16:26 <font color="#ff0000">For what is a man profited, if he
shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man
give in exchange for his soul?</font></p>
    <p>Mark 8:35 <font color="#ff0000">For whosoever will save his
life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and
the gospel's, the same shall save it.</font><br>
Mark 8:36 <font color="#ff0000">For what shall it profit a man, if he
shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</font><br>
Mark 8:37 <font color="#ff0000">Or what shall a man give in exchange
for his soul?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above two passages make plain that the words soul and life are
interchangeable. When you die, you lose your soul, which is to say you
lose your life. The wicked man who rules the world, but loses his soul,
does not take up residence next in hell for eternity. Rather he
perishes, he loses his life, he ceases to exist. The implication being
that he has foolishly traded away his eternal life for earthly wealth.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>ADAM AND EVE DENIED ETERNAL
LIFE IN SIN</u></font></b></p>
  <p>Now notice this account of Adam and Eve and how they were <em>denied</em>
eternal life-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one
of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and
take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:<br>
Gen 3:23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When Adam and Eve ate of the forbidden tree of knowledge of good
and evil, they lost the right to eat of the tree of life. God expelled
them from the garden, forbidding them to eat from the tree of life, and
thereby denied them eternal life because they had sinned.&nbsp; They
had to die because of their sin, but death did not give them instant
access to heaven! When Adam and Eve died, they lost the God-given spark
of life and perished. They returned to the dust-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till
thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>
    <p>Job 34:15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn
again unto dust.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Death returns you to the dust, in a totally unconscious state.
Nothing survives after death.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>THE <a name="SLEEP OF DEATH">SLEEP
OF DEATH</a></u></font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now notice how Jesus himself describes death-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto
them, <font color="#ff0000">Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go,
that I may awake him out of sleep.</font><br>
John 11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.<br>
John 11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he
had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.<br>
John 11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <font color="#ff0000">Lazarus
is dead.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 9:24 He said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">Give place:
for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth.</font> And they laughed him to
scorn.</p>
    <p>Mark 5:39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, <font
 color="#ff0000">Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not
dead, but sleepeth.</font></p>
    <p>Luke 8:52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, <font
 color="#ff0000">Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</font><br>
Luke 8:53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In Jesus own words above, death is described to be like a sleep.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Job 14:10 NIV But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last
and is no more.<br>
Job 14:11 As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes
parched and dry,<br>
Job 14:12 so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no
more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.</p>
    <p>Psa 13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes,
lest I sleep the sleep of death;</p>
    <p>James 4:14 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For
what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
time, and then vanisheth away.</p>
    <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u><a
 name="Absent From the Body">Absent From the Body</a> - Present With
the Lord?</u></font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>When a man dies, he is asleep and does not awake until the end of
time. But doesn't Paul say that the very moment he dies he will be with
Christ?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Phil 1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.<br>
Phil 1:22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour:
yet what I shall choose I wot not.<br>
Phil 1:23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart,
and to be with Christ; which is far better:<br>
Phil 1:24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Cor 5:6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that,
whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:<br>
2 Cor 5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<br>
2 Cor 5:8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from
the body, and to be present with the Lord.<br>
2 Cor 5:9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may
be accepted of him.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus equated death with sleep, so Paul is saying that should he
die, he would sleep the sleep of death, and next see Jesus Christ after
the resurrection. To Paul, however, the passing of time after his death
would be as an instant, the blink of an eye, and his next thing he
would know it would be the second coming, and the resurrection of all
the righteous saints.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 14:1 <font color="#ff0000">Let not your heart be troubled:
ye believe in God, believe also in me.</font><br>
John 14:2 <font color="#ff0000">In my Father's house are many
mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a
place for you.</font><br>
John 14:3 <font color="#ff0000">And if I go and prepare a place for
you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am,
there ye may be also.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">When does Jesus receive us? Jesus says it will be at
His second coming, not at the moment of death.</p>

are they conscious of?</p>

  <p>The dead know not anything, everything about them perishes,
including their conscious mind. They remain this way until their
resurrection.</p>

    <p>Psa 6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the
grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
    <p>Psa 146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man,
in whom there is no help.<br>
Psa 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
very day his thoughts perish.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Even the thoughts of the dead perish with them when they lose
their soul (the spark of life).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dan 12:2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth
shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and

  <p>The dead are sleeping until their resurrection, that is when they
will awake.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 10:28 <font color="#ff0000">And fear not them which kill
the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which
is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This verse is used by the Catholic Church to prove that the soul
can't be killed, that it is immortal. In fact it means do not fear
those who can kill your physical body but have no control over your
resurrection and eternal destiny. Rather, fear God, who does determine
who goes into the lake of fire (eternal death) to be forever <em>destroyed,
body and soul</em>, and who gets eternal life. The choice is actually
ours, and God affirms the choice we make.</p>

resurrection of the dead.<br>
1 Cor 15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made

    <p>Mat 27:52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the
saints which slept arose,<br>
Mat 27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went
into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Those who are dead are asleep in the grave, to be awakened at
their resurrection. The above mentioned saints did not come down from
heaven to re-inhabit their bodies. They were resurrected from the grave
(awakened from their sleep) in a victory over death, at the time of
Christ's resurrection.</p>

  <p>At the second coming, <em>the last day</em>, THAT is when the
righteous will receive immortality, but they do not have it before
then. Here is a <em> promise</em> of eternal life-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 John 2:25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us,
even eternal life.</p>
    <p>Heb 9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through

conscience from dead works to serve the living God?<br>
Heb 9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that
were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the
promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here, in verse 14, the Holy Spirit is the eternal spirit. Verse 15
says that Jesus died to redeem us from our sins, that we may receive
the eternal life that is promised. We do not receive this eternal life
until after we have been judged righteous, which is at the second
coming. Until then, we have the <em>promise</em> of eternal life.</p>
  <blockquote>

  <p>We seek immortality, but do not have it yet. Only the righteous
will receive it at the second coming, from God Himself, by being
permitted access to the tree of life. The wicked, however, will not be
given access to the tree of life, so immortality is simply not possible
for them. They will not live forever, they will perish, <i>they will

RESURRECTION HOPE</a></font></b></u></p>
  <p align="left">Every year during the Easter season, Christian
pulpits ring with sermons proclaiming the fundamental importance of the
resurrection of Jesus Christ to the Christian faith, and rightly so,
for if Christ is not raised from the dead, our faith in in vain, as
scripture makes very clear:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1 Cor 15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose
from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of
the dead?<br>
1 Cor 15:13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ
not risen:<br>
1 Cor 15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
your faith is also vain.<br>
1 Cor 15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we
have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up,
if so be that the dead rise not.<br>
1 Cor 15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:<br>
1 Cor 15:17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet
in your sins.<br>
1 Cor 15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are
perished.<br>
1 Cor 15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all
men most miserable.<br>
1 Cor 15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
firstfruits of them that slept.<br>
1 Cor 15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the
resurrection of the dead.<br>
1 Cor 15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive.<br>
1 Cor 15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Paul is clearly teaching here that the resurrection
from the dead is a critical point to understand for the Christian, for
if there is no resurrection from the dead (as demonstrated by Christ's
resurrection), your faith is <i>totally</i> in vain. But, why would
Paul say this, if when you died, you continued to live in a conscious
spirit form in heaven (as is taught by most Christian churches)? That
would make <i>no sense</i> at all. Paul is saying that without a
resurrection, the dead would cease to exist forever, in any form at
all. Death would be final, a completely futile and hopeless end of
existence. Paul clearly put his hope in the promise of a resurrection
from the grave, which he says happens at Christ's second coming.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Phil 3:8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things but
loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for
whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but
dung, that I may win Christ,<br>
Phil 3:9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which
is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith:<br>
Phil 3:10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and
the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;<br>
Phil 3:11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the
dead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Paul again addressed the resurrection to the
Thessalonian church: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">1 Th 4:13 But I would not have you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as
others which have no hope.<br>
1 Th 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring [forth from the grave]
with him.<br>
1 Th 4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not
prevent [precede] them which are asleep.<br>
1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the
dead in Christ shall rise first:<br>
1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
shall we ever be with the Lord.<br>
1 Th 4:18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The Thessalonians were sorrowing over the dead, and
concerned that because they were dead, they were gone forever and
without any hope of salvation. Note that Paul does <i>not</i> comfort
the Thessalonians by saying the immortal spirits of their dead loved
ones are <i>already</i> blissfully in heaven in the presence of the
Lord. Paul responds that just as Jesus was resurrected from the dead,
so those who have died in faith will be resurrected at the second
coming, then to ever be with the Lord. And Paul makes the point that
this resurrection of the righteous dead <i>precedes</i> the living
saints joining the Lord in the clouds. Paul is clearly reaffirming the
resurrection hope to the Thessalonian church, not the immortality of
the soul. </p>
  <p align="left">The resurrection of Jesus Christ demonstrates that
for those with faith in Him, <i>even the power of death can be
overcome by that faith</i>:</p>

  <p><b><u>On Matt 22:23-32, Mark 12:19-27, and Luke 20:27-38.</u></b></p>
  <p>Jesus is asked by the Sadducees (who did not believe in a
resurrection) a hypothetical case of a woman who has seven consecutive
brothers as husbands:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is
no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,<br>
Mark 12:19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and
leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother
should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.<br>
Mark 12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife,
and dying left no seed.<br>
Mark 12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
and the third likewise.<br>
Mark 12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the
woman died also.<br>
Mark 12:23 <strong>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise</strong>,
whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.<br>
Mark 12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, <font color="#ff0000">Do
ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the
power of God?</font><br>
Mark 12:25 <font color="#ff0000">For <strong>when they shall rise
from the dead</strong>, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage;
but are as the angels which are in heaven.</font><br>
Mark 12:26 <font color="#ff0000"><strong>And as touching the dead,
that they rise</strong>: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in
the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</font><br>
Mark 12:27 <font color="#ff0000">He is not the God of the dead, but
the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that both the question of the Sadducees, and the answer Jesus
gives, deal with <i>after</i> the resurrection? If as Catholicism (and
much of Christianity) teaches, people went immediately to heaven after
death, then the focus of the conversation would have been on the recent
dead, not those who are<i> resurrected</i> from death at some point in
the future. Note that Jesus rebukes the Sadducees for not knowing the
teaching of scripture, or the power of God with respect to raising the
dead. Jesus is affirming to the Sadducees that there will indeed be a
resurrection from death, that there is victory over the grave!</p>
  <p>Verse 26, however, does not prove that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
are alive in heaven, but rather, because of their faith, they will
indeed be resurrected and then be rewarded with eternal life, something
the Sadducees rejected (v. 18). Note that Jesus begins verse 26 with - <i>and
as touching the dead, that they rise</i> - Jesus then goes on to
present Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as prime examples of those who will be
raised from the dead, despite the false beliefs of the Sadducees. The
Sadducees rejected the resurrection from the dead, and Jesus in verse
27 is saying that God will not be the God of the dead and buried, but
the God of the living, the resurrected, as he makes clear at the
beginning of verse 26.</p>
  <p><b><u>On Acts 2:29-34</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the
patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is
with us unto this day.<br>
Acts 2:30 Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with
an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,
he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;<br>
Acts 2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ,
that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see
corruption.<br>
Acts 2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we are all witnesses.<br>
Acts 2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed
forth this, which ye now see and hear.<br>
Acts 2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,<br>
Acts 2:35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.<br>
Acts 3:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that
God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Please note that David is <i>not</i> in heaven (not even in some
alleged spirit form). According to verse 34, he is still dead, still in
the grave. While he was living, David spoke of the resurrection of
Jesus, that Jesus would not be left in the grave (hell), but rather,
God would raise Jesus from the dead and He would be exalted as Lord and
Christ. It is this victory over death and the grave that Jesus Christ
offers us if we will have faith in Him. But this reward is something we
receive <i>after</i> our resurrection, not before:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:12 <font color="#ff0000">And behold, I come quickly; and
my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</font><br>
Rev 22:13 <font color="#ff0000">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning
and the end, the first and the last.</font><br>
Rev 22:14 <font color="#ff0000">Blessed are they that do his
commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may
enter in through the gates into the city.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We do not get access to the tree of life and live forever until
after the second coming, at which time the righteous will be
resurrected, and enter the New Jerusalem. That is when we will be given
the opportunity to eat from the tree of life.</p>
  <p><b><u>On 1 Peter 4:1-6</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Pet 4:1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the
flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;<br>
1 Pet 4:2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.<br>
1 Pet 4:3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts,
excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:<br>
1 Pet 4:4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run riot, speaking evil
of you:<br>
1 Pet 4:5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the
quick and the dead.<br>
1 Pet 4:6 For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are
dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live
according to God in the spirit.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This does not speak of preaching to dead people in the grave in
the physical sense. In context it is speaking of preaching to the
Gentiles, the unbelievers, the spiritually dead, that they too might
hear and believe the Gospel message. Another example of this is found
in the book of John:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 5:25 <font color="#ff0000">Verily, verily, I say unto you,
The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of
the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At the time, Jesus was speaking of those people hearing His voice
at that instant. Those that were spiritually dead in the crowd that
heard and believed Him, would inherit eternal life. This is exactly
what 1 Peter 4:6 is saying as well. Until the resurrection, however,
those in the grave hear nothing and do nothing:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Eccl 9:5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead
know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
of them is forgotten.</p>
    <p>Eccl 9:10 Whatsover thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The time is indeed coming, however, when Jesus will speak to those
dead in their graves:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 5:28 <font color="#ff0000">Marvel not at this: for the
hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his
voice,</font><br>
John 5:29 <font color="#ff0000">And shall come forth; they that have
done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil,
unto the resurrection of damnation.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4"><u>CONCLUSION</u></font></b></p>
  <p>When we die, we sleep in the grave - we have no thoughts, no
consciousness, no existence at all, until our resurrection. At the
resurrection of the just, at the second coming, the righteous will
receive eternal life. That is the reward for faith:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 3:16 <font color="#ff0000">For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus brings the gift or reward of eternal life to bestow on the
faithful at the second coming, but not before. The wicked however, will
eventually <i> perish </i><em>forever</em> in the lake of fire (after
the 1000 years). Any church that teaches otherwise (that everyone, even
the wicked, live forever) is merely repeating the first lie told in the
Garden of Eden- <em>"Ye shall not surely die".</em></p>
