  Benny Hinn Prophesies That God's Glory&nbsp;<br>

  <hr>
  <p align="left">In the first few minutes of his 21 November <i> This Is
  Your Day</i> program, Benny Hinn claims to have recently had
  a prophetic dream in which he saw a visible manifestation of God as a circle
  of fire above a crowd! He claimed that this is about to happen!</p>

      <tr>
        <td width="100%">I believe we are about to see the glory of God
          manifested, Saints. Everything, <i>everything</i> I, I'm, I'm in, I
          saw in dreams back in the '70s. Now please hear this. Everything I've
          seen in the last 28 years as a preacher, I saw in dreams after I got
          saved. I used to have visions and see myself preach. ...&nbsp;
          <p>Now, in the last few months God has been giving me new dreams and
          new visions. Are you ready? I am seeing things now in my dreams and
          visions that are causing me to go into awe. This is the first time,
          this is the first time I talk about this on television. This is the
          first time I discuss it with you, my wonderful partners and friends on
          <i>This Is Your Day</i>. So far only my wife has known, and Paul and
          Jan Crouch, and that's about all. The Lord has been showing me, in
          visions and dreams, visible fire over crowds. I have seen in my
          visions and dreams lately, where a fire appears over people, like,
          like a massive circle of fire over people as they worship God. Now I
          do not understand what this is all about, but I do know that the glory
          of God was visible in the Old Testament as fire. Forty years Israel
          saw fire. On the day of Pentecost they saw fire in the upper room. I
          believe the body of Christ is about to experience the fire of God's
          glory. <i>Are you ready for it saints?</i> ...</p>
          <p>Church, get ready! Saints of God get ready! We are about to be
          visited by the Glory of God, in an awesome way in America. -- Benny
          Hinn, <i>This Is Your Day</i>, 21 November 2001.</td>
