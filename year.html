<blockquote>
  <p>Some people have calculated that there were 4000 years from creation to the
  birth of Jesus. This would mean that 2000 A.D. placed us 6000 years after
  creation. Using the 7 day week as a template, and a day equaling a thousand
  years to God <nobr>(2 Peter 3:8),</nobr> this would seem to indicate six
  thousand years for man to inhabit earth, to be followed by a sabbath of 1000
  years during the millennial reign of Christ.</p>
  <p>This tends to focus great significance to the start of the 3rd millennium
  after the birth of Christ. A question then arises. Who formulated the current
  calendar, and how accurate were they? When would the 3rd millennium actually
  begin?</p>
  <p><strong><u>Dionysius Exiguus</u></p>
  </strong>
  <p>In 525 A.D. a Sythian monk in Rome, Dionysius Exiguus (Dionysius the 
  Little), was preparing new tables for determining the date of <b><a
  href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/const1-easter.html">Easter,</a> </b>and
  he decided to abandon the pagan calendar in use at the time, that was based on
  the first year of the reign of Emperor Diocletian (29 Aug., 284). Instead he
  began a calendar based on his calculated year of the birth of Jesus Christ.
  Among the biblical data Dionysius had to work with was the following:</p>
  <p>Luke 3:1 - Jesus was baptized in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius<br>
  Luke 3:23 says Jesus was about 30 years old at the start of his ministry, His
  baptism.*</p>
  <p>Using this and other data available to him, he calculated the probable year
  of Jesus birth as occurring in the 753rd since the founding of the Roman
  empire, which he redesignated the year 1. This method of dating the year was
  not generally accepted for hundreds of years, but has been nearly universally
  adopted today.</p>
  <p>* It can be demonstrated from the <b><a href="dan927.html">70 week prophecy 
  of Daniel 9</a></b> that the baptism of Jesus occurred in 27 A.D., which would 
  place His birth about or before 3 B.C.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Was 2000 A.D. really the 2000th year since the birth of Christ?</u></strong></p>
  <p>Just about everyone knows that the year 2000 A.D. (Anno Domini) was
  supposed to indicate the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ. But
  was Dionysius accurate in his calculations? In the book of Matthew we have an
  important bit of information:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
    Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Jewish historian <strong><a
  href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/History/BC/FlaviusJosephus/">Flavius Josephus</a>
  </strong>tells us that Herod died shortly after an eclipse of the
  moon  (<a
  href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/History/BC/FlaviusJosephus/?book=Ant_17&amp;chapter=6"><b>Antiquities
  of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter VI, end of 4th paragraph</b></a>), but prior
  to Passover (Wars of the Jews, Book II, Chapter I, paragraph 3.). This is an
  extremely important bit of information, because astronomers today know that
  there were eclipses of the moon on the following dates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A total eclipse on March 23rd, 5 BC at 8.52 pm.
    <li>A partial eclipse on March 13th, 4 BC at 4.04 am.
    <li>A total eclipse on January 10th, 1 BC at 1.35 am.
  </ul>
  <p>Historians have determined, on this and other evidence, that King Herod
  apparently died in the Spring of what we now call 4 B.C. (Julian year 4710),
  probably early in the Jewish month of Nisan (April), after the partial eclipse
  of the moon occurring on March 13th, 4 B.C. If you will recall, Herod lived
  long enough after Jesus' birth to order the slaughter of the infants in
  Bethlehem, in an attempt to murder Jesus-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
    exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in
    Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under,
    according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This would suggest that Jesus was born in either 5 or 6 B.C., as Herod set
  an upper age limit of 2 years for the infants to be slain. So, on this
  evidence alone, the current method of numbering the years since the birth of
  Jesus is in error by at least 4 years, and perhaps as much as 5 years. So if
  we were to correct for this error, 1996 would more accurately be numbered as
  no less than <nobr>2000 A.D., </nobr>although even this may be off by as much
  as a year or so. In any case the year 2000 (as we are currently counting) was
  clearly <em>not</em> exactly 2000 years from the birth of Christ.
  <p>Even if the calendar of today were accurate, the true 3rd millennium did
  not begin until Jan. 1st, 2001 due to the fact that there was no year 0 -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1-100 is the first century
    <li>101-200 is the second century
    <li>---
    <li>1901-2000 is the 20th century
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>1-1000 is the first millennium
    <li>1001-2000 is the second millennium
    <li>2001-3000 is the third millennium
  </ul>
  <p>But now, figuring that Jesus was born in 5 B.C. this would be adjusted as
  follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>5 B.C.-996 A.D. is the first millennium
    <li>997-1996 is the second millennium
    <li>1997-2996 is the third millennium
  </ul>
  <p>So, no matter how you look at it, the year 2000 A.D. was really 
  meaningless, because the current calendar is clearly in error. So 
  interestingly enough, based on the best available evidence, 1997 may have 
  actually marked the end of the 2000th year since the birth of Jesus Christ and 
  the beginning of the 3rd millennium!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no evidence to support the 25th of December as the birth date of
  Jesus Christ, but there is a biblical case for placing His birth in the September -
  October timeframe.
