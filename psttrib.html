<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 17:33 <font color="#FF0000">Whosoever shall seek to save his life 
    shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</font><br>
    Luke 17:34 <font color="#FF0000">I tell you, in that night there shall be 
    two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</font><br>
    Luke 17:35 <font color="#FF0000">Two women shall be grinding together; the 
    one shall be taken, and the other left.</font><br>
    Luke 17:36 <font color="#FF0000">Two men shall be in the field; the one 
    shall be taken, and the other left.</font><br>
    Luke 17:37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said 
    unto them, <font color="#FF0000">Wheresoever the body is, thither will the 
    eagles be gathered together.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The above passage is frequently quoted to support a &quot;secret&quot; rapture, that 
  neither the saved or the lost will be aware of what is happening at the time. 
  Supposedly, millions of Christians will be &quot;taken&quot; and simply disappear 
  mysteriously, leaving the world wondering where they went. Just what does this 
  passage really intend to teach? Well, first let's look at a parallel passage 
  in Matthew:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 24:27 <font color="#FF0000">For as the lightning cometh out of the 
    east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of 
    man be.</font><br>
    Mat 24:28 <font color="#FF0000">For wheresoever the carcase is, there will 
    the eagles be gathered together.<br>
    </font>...<br>
    Mat 24:37 <font color="#FF0000">But as the days of Noe were, so shall also 
    the coming of the Son of man be.</font><br>
    Mat 24:38 <font color="#FF0000">For as in the days that were before the 
    flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until 
    the day that Noe entered into the ark,</font><br>
    Mat 24:39 <font color="#FF0000">And knew not until the flood came, and took 
    them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</font><br>
    Mat 24:40 <font color="#FF0000">Then shall two be in the field; the one 
    shall be taken, and the other left.</font><br>
    Mat 24:41 <font color="#FF0000">Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the 
    one shall be taken, and the other left.</font><br>
    Mat 24:42 <font color="#FF0000">Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour 
    your Lord doth come.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that in verse 39, the wicked who perished in the flood are described 
  as being <i>taken away. </i>The <i>wicked</i> are taken first, <i>not</i> the 
  righteous. Next, it tells us that it shall be exactly the same at the second 
  coming of the Lord. Clearly in in days of Noah, those <i>taken first</i> 
  perished, and so it will be again at the second coming. The Greek word 
  translated as &quot;took&quot; in verse 39 is: </p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>142. airo, ah'ee-ro; a prim. verb; to lift; by impl. to take up or away; 
  fig. to raise (the voice), keep in suspense (the mind); spec. to sail away 
  (i.e. weigh anchor); by Heb. [comp. H5375] to expiate sin:--away with, bear 
  (up), carry, lift up, loose, make to doubt, put away, remove, take (away, up).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that the word means to remove or to take away, as in to dispose of. Now notice that in 
  Luke 17:37, a question is asked: &quot;Where, Lord? And he said unto them,
  <font color="#FF0000">Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be 
  gathered together&quot;.</font> This answer given by Jesus refers to the vultures 
  gathering over the bodies of the wicked, those <i>taken first and disposed of 
   
  </i>in Mat 24:39, which are 
  all slain at the second coming (See also Rev 19:20-21). This is in harmony 
  with the sense that being &quot;taken&quot; means in the following verses:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Josh 8:8 And it shall be, when ye have <u>taken the city</u>, that ye 
    shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall 
    ye do. See, I have commanded you.</p>
    <p>Josh 8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had <u>taken 
    the city</u>, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned 
    again, and slew the men of Ai.</p>
    <p>Judg 1:8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had
    <u>taken it</u>, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city 
    on fire.</p>
    <p>1 Ki 9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and <u>taken Gezer</u>, 
    and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and 
    given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.</p>
    <p>1 Ki 16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the <u>city was taken</u>, 
    that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house 
    over him with fire, and died,</p>
    <p>Jer 38:23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the 
    Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but <u>shalt be 
    taken</u> by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city 
    to be burned with fire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In the above verses, to be taken is to be captured, defeated and destroyed. 
  That is what Mat 24:39 is saying:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 24:39 <font color="#FF0000">And knew not until the flood came, and took 
    them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, however, there is a different word translated &quot;taken&quot; in the following 
  verses, giving a change in meaning not apparent in the English translation:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 24:40 <font color="#FF0000">Then shall two be in the field; the one 
  shall be taken, and the other left.</font><br>
  Mat 24:41 <font color="#FF0000">Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the 
  one shall be taken, and the other left.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here is the definition of the word:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>3880. paralambano, par-al-am-ban'-o; from G3844 and G2983; to receive near, 
  i.e. associate with oneself (in any familiar or intimate act or relation); by 
  anal. to assume an office; fig. to learn:--receive, take (unto, with).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This word has the positive connotation of being taken <i>with</i>, as in to 
  be received or accepted. So this is the resulting meaning of the passage:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Mat 24:39 <font color="#FF0000">And knew not until the flood came, and took 
     
    </font>[disposed of]<font color="#FF0000"> them  </font>[the wicked]<font color="#FF0000"> all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</font><br>
    Mat 24:40 <font color="#FF0000">Then shall two be in the field; the one 
    shall be taken </font>[with, received or accepted]<font color="#FF0000">, 
  and the other left </font>[slain on earth]<font color="#FF0000">.</font><br>
    Mat 24:41 <font color="#FF0000">Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the 
    one shall be taken </font>[with, received or accepted]<font color="#FF0000">, 
  and the other left </font>[slain on earth]<font color="#FF0000">.</font></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="4"><u><strong>The Lesson of Noah and the flood, 
  and Lot and Sodom</strong></u></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The 17th chapter of Luke, which we began this study with, again makes it 
  plain that <em>all</em> living wicked people <em>will perish</em> at the 
  second return of Christ: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Luke 17:26 <font color="#FF0000">And as it was in the days of Noe, so 
    shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</font><br>
    Luke 17:27 <font color="#FF0000">They did eat, they drank, they married 
    wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the 
    ark, and the flood came, and <em><strong>destroyed them all</strong></em>.</font><br>
    Luke 17:28 <font color="#FF0000">Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; 
    they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they 
    builded;</font><br>
    Luke 17:29 <font color="#FF0000">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom 
    it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and <em><strong>destroyed them all</strong></em>.</font><br>
    Luke 17:30 <font color="#FF0000"><strong><em>Even thus shall it be in the 
    day when the Son of man is revealed</em></strong>.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The lesson is clear. Sudden destruction comes upon the wicked at the second 
  coming, they will all perish as in the days of Noah:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Gen 7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of 
  cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the 
  earth, and every man:<br>
  Gen 7:22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the 
  dry land, died.<br>
  Gen 7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of 
  the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the 
  heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, 
  and they that were with him in the ark.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So in Luke 17 and Matt 24, Jesus was not 
  teaching a mysterious, silent, or <i>secret</i> rapture of the righteous away from the 
  world. He was making it clear, that at His second coming, all the wicked will 
  be taken and slain first,<i> </i>leaving only the righteous alive, who will then 
  accompany Jesus to heaven. 
  This utter destruction of the wicked at Jesus' return is completely ignored by those teaching the 
  secret rapture.</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><u><strong>The Second Coming Described</strong></u></font></p>
  <p>The following verses all show that with respect to the second coming, Jesus 
  will indeed come quickly-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 3:11 <font color="#FF0000">Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast 
    which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 22:7 <font color="#FF0000">Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that 
    keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 22:12 <font color="#FF0000">And, behold, I come quickly; and my 
    reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 22:20 He which testifieth these things saith, <font color="#FF0000">
    Surely I come quickly.</font> Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</p>
    <p>Mat 24:27 <font color="#FF0000">For as the lightning cometh out of the 
    east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of 
    man be.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And the following verses refer to the second coming of Jesus as being like 
  a thief for the wicked-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 3:3 <font color="#FF0000">Remember therefore how thou hast received 
    and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I 
    will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come 
    upon thee.</font></p>
    <p>Rev 16:15 <font color="#FF0000">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he 
    that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see 
    his shame.</font></p>
    <p>1 Th 5:4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should 
    overtake you as a thief.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It should be quite clear that all the above verses are indeed referring to 
  the second coming of Jesus. He will come quickly, like lightning, as a thief 
  upon the unsuspecting wicked of the world. But is it a secret, silent event?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Pet 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in 
    the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements 
    shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein 
    shall be burned up.<br>
    2 Pet 3:11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner 
    of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,<br>
    2 Pet 3:12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, 
    wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall 
    melt with fervent heat?</p>
    <p>1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, 
    with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in 
    Christ shall rise first:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It will be the noisiest, most climactic event in history, <i>not</i> a 
  silent, mysterious secret.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><u><strong>The Parable of the Tares of the 
    Field.</strong></u></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, in the book of Matthew, Jesus tells a parable about the end of the 
  world, which is intended to explain some end time events of the second coming:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying,<font color="#FF0000"> 
    The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his 
    field:</font><br>
    Mat 13:25 <font color="#FF0000">But while men slept, his enemy came and 
    sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</font><br>
    Mat 13:26 <font color="#FF0000">But when the blade was sprung up, and 
    brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</font><br>
    Mat 13:27 <font color="#FF0000">So the servants of the householder came and 
    said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence 
    then hath it tares?</font><br>
    Mat 13:28 <font color="#FF0000">He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. 
    The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</font><br>
    Mat 13:29 <font color="#FF0000">But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up 
    the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</font><br>
    Mat 13:30 <font color="#FF0000">Let both grow together until the harvest: 
    and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together 
    first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat 
    into my barn.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus then explains the parable in detail to His disciples:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: 
    and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the 
    tares of the field.<br>
    Mat 13:37 He answered and said unto them, <font color="#FF0000">He that 
    soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</font><br>
    Mat 13:38 <font color="#FF0000">The field is the world; the good seed are 
    the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked 
    one;</font><br>
    Mat 13:39 <font color="#FF0000">The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the 
    harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</font><br>
    Mat 13:40 <font color="#FF0000">As therefore the tares are gathered and 
    burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</font><br>
    Mat 13:41 <font color="#FF0000">The Son of man shall send forth his angels, 
    and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them 
    which do iniquity;</font><br>
    Mat 13:42 <font color="#FF0000">And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: 
    there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</font><br>
    Mat 13:43 <font color="#FF0000">Then shall the righteous shine forth as the 
    sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note the timing of events Jesus describes, and how it compares with those 
  taken<i> first</i> in Matthew 24:39-42. At the end of the world, when the time 
  for the harvest of humanity has come, it is <em>not the righteous who are 
  gathered first</em>, it is the wicked! The wicked are taken and dealt with 
  first, while the people of God are <em>still among them</em>. Advocates of the 
  popular pre-tribulation rapture propose that all righteous Christians will 
  first be taken up by Jesus secretly, in an instant, leaving behind a totally 
  non-Christian world in startled ignorance of why a significant portion of the 
  population has simply disappeared off the face of the earth. The secret 
  rapture theory is the <em>reverse</em> sequence of the parable as told by 
  Jesus, and so can be dismissed on this point alone! Jesus in the book of 
  Matthew again <i>confirms</i> that the wicked will be taken out from <em>among</em> 
  the righteous:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 13:49 <font color="#FF0000">So shall it be at the end of the world: 
    the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</font><br>
    Mat 13:50 <font color="#FF0000">And shall cast them into the furnace of 
    fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><u><strong>The Seven Last Plagues.</strong></u></font></p>
  <p>Now let me point out an interesting fact. Revelation 16 relates the last 
  seven plagues being poured out on the unrepentant wicked of the earth. Through 
  verse 12 the first six of the plagues are poured out, and THEN in verse 15-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 16:15 <font color="#FF0000">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he 
    that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see 
    his shame.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly Jesus HAS NOT COME YET AT THE TIME OF THE SIXTH PLAGUE! Now, note 
  the counsel given to the church of Laodicea:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 3:18<font color="#FF0000"> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in 
    the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be 
    clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine 
    eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>The counsel addressed the church of Laodicea, the final church, is given 
    to that church in<i> </i>Rev 16:15<i> - after</i> the sixth plague has 
    fallen, so obviously the church has <i>gone through</i> the preceding 
    plagues! Note that the seventh plague then falls in verse 17-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 16:16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew 
    tongue Armageddon.<br>
    Rev 16:17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there 
    came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It 
    is done.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus at the time of the seventh plague is announcing that time for earth 
  has come to an end, and the second coming follows immediately. So Jesus does 
  not come back to earth until after all seven plagues have been poured out on 
  the wicked. The faithful church was NOT removed at any point prior to these 
  plagues, they have endured them without fear of being affected by them:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the 
    arrow that flieth by day;<br>
    Psa 91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the 
    destruction that wasteth at noonday.<br>
    Psa 91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right 
    hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.<br>
    Psa 91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the 
    wicked.<br>
    Psa 91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most 
    High, thy habitation;<br>
    Psa 91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come 
    nigh thy dwelling.<br>
    Psa 91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all 
    thy ways.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So the wicked will suffer the 7 last plagues, <em>while</em> the people of 
  God are <em>still present</em> with them on this earth.</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="4"><u><strong>Does the Second Coming Happen 
  Secretly?</strong></u></font></p>
  <p>There are two verses where Jesus himself described exactly how he would 
  come back to this earth. These words were spoken to the high priest of the 
  Jews - Caiaphas:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 26:64 Jesus saith unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Thou hast said: 
    nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting 
    on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 14:62 And Jesus said, <font color="#FF0000">I am: and ye shall see 
    the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds 
    of heaven.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jesus says that Caiaphas will be alive (resurrected) to see him return in 
  his full glory, <em>in the clouds of heaven</em>. This is a significant key to 
  his return. It is a direct link to -</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and <em>every eye shall see him</em>, 
    and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail 
    because of him. Even so, Amen.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So as the above study shows:</p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(1).&nbsp; AFTER THE 7 PLAGUES OF REV 16 FALL ON THE WICKED, AND NOT 
  BEFORE, JESUS COMES IN THE CLOUDS.</strong></p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(2).&nbsp; EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIS COMING.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>The return of Jesus (in the clouds) will be witnessed by every living 
  person on this earth at the time. In addition, those who had a part in the 
  crucifixion of Jesus (pierced him) will be resurrected to witness this 
  glorious event as well, to include Caiaphas.</p>
  <p>Jesus coming in the clouds is mentioned in the following texts as well. It 
  is an important discriminator between the genuine coming of Jesus and the 
  impersonation of Jesus by Satan-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and 
    judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>
    <p>Psa 104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh 
    the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
    <p>Jer 4:13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as 
    a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are 
    spoiled.</p>
    <p>Dan 7:13 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man 
    came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they 
    brought him near before him.</p>
    <p>Mat 16:27 <font color="#FF0000">For the Son of man shall come in the 
    glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man 
    according to his works.</font></p>
    <p>Mat 24:30 <font color="#FF0000">And then shall appear the sign of the Son 
    of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and 
    shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great 
    glory.</font><br>
    Mat 24:31 <font color="#FF0000">And he shall send his angels with a great 
    sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four 
    winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</font></p>
    <p>Mark 13:26 <font color="#FF0000">And then shall they see the Son of man 
    coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</font><br>
    Mark 13:27 <font color="#FF0000">And then shall he send his angels, and 
    shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part 
    of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</font></p>

  <p>If, as we have established in point (3), every eye will see him coming in 
  all his glory, what is the fate of the then living wicked who behold him?</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>The wicked who see Jesus at the second coming will be cut off, they will 
  perish, because sinful man cannot look upon the face of God in His full glory 
  and live. Just as the parable of the wheat and tares declares (Matt 13:24-43), 
  the wicked will all perish first, <em>before</em> the righteous are gathered.</p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(4).&nbsp; THE WICKED WILL ALL BE SLAIN AT JESUS' SECOND COMING BY THE FIRE 
  OF HIS RIGHTEOUS GLORY, TO BE RESURRECTED AFTER THE 1000 YEARS.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>But doesn't Isaiah 65:19-25 describe a picture of idyllic conditions during 
  the millennial reign of Jesus on earth? No. It is true this has to be 
  describing conditions here on earth because it states death will still occur 
  in verse 20. So what is this passage dealing with? It is describing how the 
  Jews would be living today, now - if they had accepted the Messiah. They would 
  be truly blessed of God, infant mortality would be unknown, people would die 
  no sooner than the age of 100, etc. The reason that this did not happen is 
  evident at the cross, the unbelief of Israel.</p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(5).&nbsp; HE COMES WITH ALL THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>But what of Zec 14:4, 5 and Jude 14. They both state that Jesus will come 
  with saints. Doesn't this prove the saints are in heaven before the second 
  coming? No, these are references to the <em>third</em> coming of Jesus, when 
  he does come with all the saints in the New Jerusalem <nobr>(Rev 21:2),</nobr> 
  but that is AFTER the 1000 years, for the great white throne judgment of all 
  the resurrected wicked <nobr>(Rev 20:11).</nobr></p>
  <p>Matthew 24 gives us the timing of the gathering or rapture of the saints - 
  after the tribulation and after the second coming. Verse 27 says He will come 
  like lightning, the seven last plagues are the tribulation of verse 29. Verse 
  30 is the second coming, with the angels of God gathering the righteous in 
  verse 31. Now notice verse 33-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 24:33 <font color="#FF0000">So likewise ye, when ye shall see all 
    these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So clearly Matt 24 is relating events that would be happening shortly prior 
  to the second coming of Jesus and the gathering of the righteous, so-</p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(6).&nbsp; ALL THE RIGHTEOUS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER <em>AFTER</em> THE 
  COMING IN THE CLOUDS OF JESUS (THE SECOND COMING), THAT EVERY EYE WILL SEE - 
  NOT BEFORE.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>And in what form will Jesus return, in spirit, or in the flesh?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Acts 1:9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was 
    taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.<br>
    Acts 1:10 And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, 
    behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;<br>
    Acts 1:11 Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into 
    heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so 
    come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(7).&nbsp; HE WAS TAKEN TO HEAVEN IN THE FLESH, HE WILL RETURN IN THE 
  FLESH.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>What will He bring with Him when He returns?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 22:12 <font color="#FF0000">And, behold, I come quickly; and my 
    reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</font></p>
    <p>1 Th 4:15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which 
    are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent [precede] 
    them which are asleep.<br>
    1 Th 4:16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with 
    the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in 
    Christ shall rise first:<br>
    1 Th 4:17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together 
    with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever 
    be with the Lord.</p>
    <p>1 Cor 15:51 Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we 
    shall all be changed,<br>
    1 Cor 15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for 
    the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we 
    shall be changed.<br>
    1 Cor 15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
    must put on immortality.</p>

  <hr>
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the Old Testament, 
  the story of Israel's bondage in Egypt is an example of the what will happen 
  in the end times.</font></p>

  ..... Exo 12:29- First born of Egypt slain</p>
  <p>GOD'S PEOPLE ARE SET FREE FROM EGYPTIAN BONDAGE</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Just as the plagues fell on Egypt, the last seven plagues will fall on the 
  wicked before the second coming. Note that the last plague, immediately prior 
  to the release of God's people, was the firstborn of Egypt being slain? This 
  is symbolic of the destruction of the wicked (tares) at the second coming, 
  prior to the gathering of the righteous (wheat) when God's people are set free 
  from sin, as described in Matthew 13.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Tim 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
    who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
    <p>Rev 22:11 <font color="#FF0000">He that is unjust, let him be unjust 
    still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is 
    righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy 
    still.<br>
    Rev 22:12 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give 
    every man according as his work shall be.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Note that judgment has been decided BEFORE the second coming, Jesus comes 
  with his reward for every man. The judgment is carried out, the separation of 
  sheep and goats, wheat and tares, happens <em>once</em> at the second coming. 
  Matthew 25 also supports the second advent rapture. Those who are not ready at 
  the appointed time will be shut-out. There is <em>no</em> second chance.</p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(9).&nbsp; JUDGMENT IS EXECUTED AT THE SECOND COMING. THERE WILL BE NO 
  SECOND CHANCES TO BE SAVED IN THE MILLENNIUM.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Did the plagues of Egypt affect or harm the Jews?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Exo 9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of 
    Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.</p>
    <p>Exo 9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, 
    was there no hail.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So how are the plagues on Egypt significant? How do they relate to the 
  second coming?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Cor 10:11 Now all these things happened unto them (the Jews) for 
    examples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the 
    world are come.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They are an example for us to use to understand exactly what will happen in 
  the end times. Again see Psalms 91:5-11. The plagues on Egypt demonstrate that 
  God's people will live <em>through</em> the period of the last 7 plagues and 
  be unaffected by them, by the power of God's protection.</p>
  <hr><strong>
  <p>(10).&nbsp; YOU CAN ONLY BE SAVED BY YOUR FAITH IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS TO 
  COVER YOUR SINS, AND BY THIS FAITH YOU WILL ENDURE HIS PLAGUES UNTOUCHED.</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <p>Are there any other types of this kind, where God's people are protected 
  untouched? Yes-</p>
  <p>The flood of Noah - Gen 7<br>
  The fiery furnace of Babylon - Dan 3<br>
  The lion's den of Babylon - Dan 6</p>
  <p>Jesus Himself established this principle beyond question, note His words:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>John 17:15 <font color="#FF0000">I pray not that thou shouldest take them 
    out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The righteous of the end times need not be removed from this earth to be 
  kept safe from the plagues that Jesus Himself pours out. The testimony of 
  Jesus makes that clear.</p>
  <p>But isn't Rev 4:1, when John is called up into heaven, a type of the 
  rapture, proving the rest of Revelation does not apply to the church? No. As 
  Rev 4:2 explains, John was in the spirit. He was seeing visions of the future 
  but he did not actually enter heaven. This was the second time that John was 
  in the spirit, the first is Rev 1:10. He was also in the spirit in Rev 17:3 
  and Rev 21:10. To point to Rev 4:1 and claim it is the rapture, as some 
  prominent pre-trib people do, can not be supported. As Rev 16:15 shows, Jesus 
  has still not yet come between the sixth and seventh plagues (vials/bowls). 
  The church is still on earth living through the plagues.</p>
  <p>But what of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19)?</p>
  <p>How does this apply? Doesn't this contradict the second advent rapture 
  principle being established here? Didn't Lot have to leave the city to be 
  saved? Wouldn't he have suffered the fate of the wicked if he had stayed? Yes, 
  he would have. Aha! Pre-tribulation rapture proved!!! No, not exactly. What 
  are Sodom and Gomorrah types (examples) of in the end times? At what point 
  MUST you be removed (from something) so as to not feel the wrath of God in the 
  end times? Does the Bible tell us?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rev 18:2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the 
    great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the 
    hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.<br>
    Rev 18:3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her 
    fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, 
    and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her 
    delicacies.<br>
    Rev 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my 
    people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her 
    plagues.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Sodom and Gomorrah are a type of spiritual Babylon (apostate religion) in 
  the end times.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Pet 2:6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes 
    condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that 
    after should live ungodly;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is another type of spiritual Babylon in the Old Testament in Joshua 
  6:20,21 after the seven trumpets have been blown seven times and the walls of 
  Jericho fell. The inhabitants of Jericho were all slain with the exception of 
  Rahab the harlot and her family, in a story remarkably similar to the 
  Passover. The seven trumpets are types of the trumpets of Revelation. Jericho 
  represents Babylon in Revelation 18 and Rahab and her family represent those 
  called out of harlot Babylon, before it and everyone in it, is utterly 
  destroyed, yet Rahab did not need to physically leave Jericho in order to be 
  saved.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>I think the above 11 points are clearly derived by allowing the Bible to 
  explain itself. Note that the pre-tribulation rapture advocates generally all 
  say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. None of the seals have been opened.<br>
    2. None of the trumpets have sounded.<br>
    3. The Antichrist has not yet been revealed.<br>
    4. The form of the mark of the beast is not yet completely known.<br>
    5. The Seal of God is not yet clear.<br>
    6. The False Prophet is still unidentified.<br>
    7. The church will leave in the rapture prior to the antichrist, plagues and 
    mark of the beast.<br>
    8. If you miss the rapture, you will get a second chance during the 
    millennium, when God will rule on this earth for the 1000 years.<br>
    9. God is dealing differently with the Jews today, when compared to the 
    Gentiles.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In each case, scriptural evidence can be presented which proves each of 
  their points to be incorrect. Here I have dealt mostly with point #7, but do 
  you notice there is a trend of ignorance and lack of concern advocated by 
  pre-tribbers? They say that since the righteous will leave this earth before 
  most of the events of the end times, you need not be concerned with any of it. 
  Interesting stuff they say, but not really relevant to today's believer. 
  Besides, according to them, what you do now does not matter anyway, you will 
  get a second chance in the millennium. Nothing could be farther from the truth 
  - it is a satanic lie. If your church advocates the pre-tribulation rapture, I 
  submit that you are being misled and need to study the matter closely for 
  yourself, and perhaps find a new church that teaches the truth.</p>
  <p>Please note it is not my intention to offend anyone. I do not question the 
  integrity or sincerity of those who believe in a secret rapture, but they ARE 
  deceived - in no uncertain terms. I have tried to offer the foundation built 
  on the true rock of the testimony of Jesus as found in the Bible. A knowledge 
  of the truth is my only goal.</p>
