<hr>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:<br>
    Mat 23:3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;
    but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is a passage that Catholics are likely to quote in support of
  Tradition, saying it is the only verse in the Bible that mentions Moses' Seat.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;On the
  face of it, it appears to be supporting the authority of the Scribes and
  Pharisees to teach orally to the people. The Scribes, who were educated in
  reading and writing, presented themselves as the great authorities on
  interpreting scripture, while the Pharisees were the spokesmen for the
  unwritten oral law or tradition. Let's take a closer look at what this passage
  is saying in context-</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,<br>
    Mat 23:2 Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What is this referring to? In a symbolic sense, sitting in Moses' seat
  means teaching from the books of Moses, the Pentateuch, the first five books 
  of the Bible:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Exo 18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that <u>Moses sat to judge the 
  people:</u> and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.<br>
  Exo 18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he 
  said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou 
  thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?<br>
  Exo 18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto 
  me to inquire of God:<br>
  Exo 18:16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one 
  and another, and <u>I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So while the phrase need not indicate a literal chair, archeologists
  have confirmed that a stone chair has been found in ancient synagogues (in Hamath, Chorazin, En-Gedi and Delos) next to where the law was kept. When
  reading from scripture, the reader would apparently sit in that chair and read 
  the law to the congregation in judgment.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:3 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and
    do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The reader (in this case a scribe or Pharisee) would exhort the people to
  be keepers of the law of Moses, obviously. Jesus here is saying that what ever
  scripture (Moses' seat) they read from and bid the people to observe, <i>that</i>
  the people <em>should</em> observe. That supports the principle of Sola
  Scriptura, not unbiblical Tradition. Catholics would have you believe that
  being in &quot;Moses' seat&quot; gave one the authority to proclaim anything
  at all, scriptural or not, and the people would have to obey the one in Moses'
  seat as though God Himself had spoken every word. But note that the scribes
  and Pharisees themselves are branded here as nothing more than hypocrites.
  They piously read from the scriptures, but did <em>not</em> observe and carry
  out what the scriptures said, and Jesus tells the people <em>not</em> to
  follow their example. Yet Catholics will suggest that this type of person was
  to be strictly obeyed in <em>whatever</em> unscriptural proclamation they made
  <em>despite</em> their hypocrisy.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
    them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of
    their fingers.<br>
    Mat 23:5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad
    their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,<br>
    Mat 23:6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the
    synagogues,<br>
    Mat 23:7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
    Rabbi.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>In addition to their hypocrisy, they abused their authority imposing
  senselessly strict and burdensome requirements on the people and made no
  effort to ease them. They put on a great show of their &quot;authority&quot;
  over the laity, and piety, and dressed accordingly. They put on a terrific and
  impressive show and take great advantage of the influence their office affords
  them.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;
    and all ye are brethren.<br>
    Mat 23:9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father,
    which is in heaven.<br>
    Mat 23:10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They are called father, Rabbi, teacher,.... When we should all call each
  other brothers (and sisters) in Christ.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.<br>
    Mat 23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
    shall humble himself shall be exalted.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>We should all be humble servants to each other.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
    shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,
    neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Not only do they reject the Gospel truth from scripture themselves, but
  they deem as &quot;heretics&quot; and persecute those who do believe and teach
  the truth from scripture and try to make it available to everyone. These
  &quot;fathers&quot; of the church in fact shut heaven to people because of
  their false Traditions and apostate doctrines, such that the truth is lost.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
    widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall
    receive the greater damnation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They prey on the widow (extort money in conjunction with services for the
  dead), and make great pretence of long prayer. Under the guise of piety, they
  rob the vulnerable, not just of money, but of truth. The condemnation of these
  false teachers is about as strong as any proclaimed in the Bible, and it is
  condemnation from Jesus Himself!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mat 23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass
    sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold
    more the child of hell than yourselves.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And how do they do that? They corrupt the convert with their false
  doctrines, and Traditions till they no longer know the truth.</p>
  <p>Who after reading this passage in context will defend Tradition with it?
  What were the Scribes and Pharisees doing that is so strongly condemned? They
  read from the books of Moses (in his seat) when teaching in the synagogue, but
  then proceeded to levy their own burdensome unbiblical laws and doctrines
  (Traditions) on the people, corrupting them and leading them astray, such that
  the Gospel message was lost or incomprehensible. And this was accompanied by
  great and splendid shows of holiness and piety.</p>
  <p>This passage applies today as much as it did in the time of Jesus. What
  leaders of the Christian church today are called &quot;father&quot;, and dress
  so they are instantly recognizable as &quot;holy men&quot;, and engage in long
  sessions of impressive ritual and prayer? They sell their authority over the
  laity first, and then their apostate doctrines and Traditions, until you are
  blind to the truth from scriptures.</p>
  <p>Who does this apply to today? The answer should be obvious. They are as
  easily recognized today, by those who know the truth, as they were in the time
  of Jesus Christ. 
  <a href="http://www.catholic-convert.com/documents/ChairOfPeter.pdf">Today they claim Peter's Chair, the one in the Vatican 
  (St. John Lateran), as
  their seat of authority</a>, rather that Moses' Seat. They look to pronouncements
  spoken ''ex-cathedra&quot;, (symbolic for from Peter's Chair) for their
  infallible doctrines, not to scripture only. They elevate their Tradition to
  equality with scripture, even proclaiming their Tradition <em>essential</em>
  to salvation. They are leading people astray, and as a result, are strongly
  condemned by Jesus in Matthew 23.</p>
  <p>I ask you, what could be more clear?</p>
