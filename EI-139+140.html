  <hr>
  <p>In newsletter <a
 href="http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/endtimeissues/et_139.htm">139</a>,
Dr. Bacchiocchi makes the following assertion:</p>
  <div align="center">
  <center>
  <table style="border-collapse: collapse;" bgcolor="#fff0f0" border="1"
 bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" width="90%">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="100%">
        <p align="left"><span style="color: black;">... "it has been
wise for our Adventist church to abandon the traditional numeric
interpretation of<i> VICARIUS FILII DEI</i> which lacks both exegetical
and historical support."</span></p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </center>
  </div>
  <p align="left"><b><u>The Exegetical Support</u></b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 13:1 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and
saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns,
and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the <u>name of
blasphemy.</u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Note that this "name of blasphemy" is associated with
the heads of the sea beast. The word translated "name" in that verse is
  <i>onoma</i>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">G3686. onoma, on'-om-ah; from a presumed der. of
the base of G1097 (comp. G3685); a "name" (lit. or fig.) [authority,
character]:--called, (+ sur-) name (-d).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The same word is translated "name" in the following
verse:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy
against God, to <u>blaspheme his name</u>, and his tabernacle, and
them that dwell in heaven.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">This "name of blasphemy" of the sea beast is again
mentioned in the following verses</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save
he that had the mark, or <u>the name of the beast, or the number of
his name.</u><br>
Rev 13:18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is
Six hundred threescore and six.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So the blasphemous name of the beast from the sea
equals 666. A key piece in this mystery is the next verse:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 19:16 And he hath on his vesture and on his
thigh a <u> name</u> written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">The same Greek word is used in that verse for "name".
Note that it refers to a <i>Title of Jesus</i>. So Revelation 13:1, 6,
17 and 18 can refer to a <i> blasphemous title</i> assumed by the
heads of the sea beast. </p>
  <p align="left">The same wisdom that unlocks the name/number of the
sea beast is mentioned in Revelation 17:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:9 And here is the mind which hath wisdom.
The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">That points us directly to the woman (church) seated
in Rome, the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
  <p align="left">So, now let's let scripture tell us a definition of
blasphemy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">John 10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again to
stone him.<br>
John 10:32 Jesus answered them, <font color="#ff0000">Many good works
have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone
me?</font><br>
John 10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest
thyself God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">VICARIVS FILII DEI (Taking the place of the Son of
God) is a blasphemous title that has a long history in Roman Catholic
documents (whether it ever appeared on a tiara or not), and it does
equal 666 when the Roman numeral value of the letters are added up. See
  <a href="666.html">http://biblelight.net/666.htm</a>
for the historical documentation.</p>
  <p align="left">It is also worth noting that Roman Catholics, while
denying any "official" standing for VICARIVS FILII DEI, will readily
admit that the synonymous VICARIVS CHRISTI is the proper and official
papal title (it does not add up to 666). Well, let's notice this next
verse:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Rev 17:3 So he carried me away in the spirit into
the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, <u>full
of names of blasphemy</u>, having seven heads and ten horns.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">So there are <i>many</i> blasphemous titles assumed
by the sea beast, not just the one that adds up to 666. Well, another
perfectly valid way of saying VICARIVS CHRISTI is ANTICHRIST, both of
which mean "Taking the place of Christ". </p>
  <p align="left">So, there <u>is</u> both historical and biblical
exegetical support for blasphemous papal titles being the name
associated with the sea beast in Revelation 13.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I have corresponded via email with Dr. Bacchiocchi,
and asked him to show me <i>any</i> flaw in the above page, and he
flatly refuses to do so. He responds with ad hominem. All he wants to
do is sell me his material, saying I obviously do not wish to learn if
I do not immediately order his study, that I am "afraid of being
enlightened", if I do not send him money for his pearls of wisdom. He
is obviously running a business, and <u>that</u> is his priority. </p>

  <p align="center">The above shows Pope John XXIII wearing a tiara on
the <i> fourth</i> anniversary of his pontificate.</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I think all the above demonstrate that a Pope could
wear a tiara on just about any day he deemed appropriate. So when
eyewitness testimony claims to have seen a pope wearing a tiara at a
papal Mass, it is believable, since popes have regularly worn a tiara
on special occasions like jubilees, Christmas, Easter, and
canonizations, etc., on the way to Mass, and after concluding Mass
(though not during the actual service).</p>
  <p align="left">So, I would say that while Dr. Bacchiocchi has good
intentions, he has obviously done limited research, and that has led
him to an erroneous conclusion. The truth is that a pope in the 19th
century may very well have worn a triple tiara or miter inscribed with
VICARIVS FILII DEI, as testified, and nothing Dr. Bacchiocchi has
presented precludes that possibility. He needs to retract and apologize
to his readers.</p>

DEI IS NEGATED <br>

1) EXEGETICALLY; by the fact that Revelation 13:18, speak of a HUMAN
NUMBER, not the number of a personal name.&nbsp; Moreover the number is
not on the forehead of the beast, but of his followers. Nowhere the
Bible uses GEMATRIA to interpret numbers. <br>
        <br>
2) HISTORICALLY, VICARIUS FILII DEI was NOT the most common name of the
pope. the common name is VICARIUS CHRISTI - VICAR OF CHRIST.&nbsp; In
the history of our Adventist church our early pioneers, including Ellen
White, believed that 666 was the number of Protestant sects influenced
by Rome. It was Uriah Smith that introduced VICARIUS FILII DEI on the
basis of stories he heard about the pope's title on the tiara. <br>
        <br>
3) ORIGINAL READERS are urged to understand the mark, name, and
number.&nbsp; They could have never understood a Latin name that was
coined eight centuries later. <br>
        <br>
4) FINAL CONFLICT over false worship enforced by the false trinity,
encompasses far more than the papacy. <br>

  <p>1) Context, context, context. In my study above, I show that <i>in
context</i> (vs. 1, 6, 17, and 19:16), Revelation 13:18 is clearly
speaking about the numeric value of a <i>blasphemous title</i> assumed
by the sea beast, the papacy. As they are not blasphemous, personal
names are indeed excluded. So, Ronald Reagan, Bill Gates, Henry
Kissinger, Ellen White, etc., are automatically excluded. Regarding
Gematria, we are told to "count the number" of the name (title) of the
sea beast, which is clearly telling us to <u>compute</u> the number
from the name (title). In other words, the numeric value is not
obvious, it must be <i>calculated</i>. To have the name or number of
the sea beast is to give allegiance to the blasphemous usurped
authority of the papacy, the key issue being the Sabbath commandment
(Dan 7:25). Dr. Bacchiocchi totally ignored the context in his
newsletter, and he refuses to address my brief study above. His
reluctance may be because he is unable to deal with the context in a
faithful and meaningful manner.</p>
  <p>2) It does not matter how rare VICARIVS FILII DEI is, it is still
valid, as it has a long history in Catholic documents.</p>
  <p>3) Dr. Bacchiocchi is asserting here that the audience of the
first century must necessarily have fully understood the riddle posed
by 666. The example of Daniel and his vision (Dan 8:27) shows that not
only can the contemporary hearers or readers not understand the
prophecy, but the prophet himself likely did not know the full
prophetic meaning <i>even as he penned the words.</i> This means God
gets the glory for the prophetic insight, not the prophet, as the human
intelligence or wisdom of the prophet is not a factor in the accuracy
of the prophecy (2 Peter 1:20-21). So I see no compelling reason for
666 to have been understood by the initial readers.</p>
  <p>4) In Elijah's time, the false trinity opposing him was King Ahab,
Jezebel, and the prophets of Baal. In John the Baptist's time it was
King Herod, Herodias, and their daughter. In Revelation the false
trinity is the Dragon (Satan), the Sea Beast (Antichrist Papacy), and
the lamblike Land Beast, which is also called the False Prophet
(Apostate U.S. Protestantism). In each case, the real threat is the
harlot woman/mother in the story, not the King (dragon/government) or
the false prophets/daughter. It is the harlot woman that demands the
death of God's people, and the government and apostate daughters are
her tools to accomplishing that goal. The same is true of the
crucifixion of Jesus. It was the Scribes and Pharisees, the rulers of
the established church, who forced the Roman government to put Jesus to
death, and they did this by inciting the people to demand His
crucifixion. History, we can see from Revelation, will repeat itself.</p>
  <p>So, am I "blinded by tradition"? Well, I carefully examine what
Scripture has to say for myself, and am willing to follow the truth
wherever it leads me. I am also willing to examine and seek out
historical evidence, and consider it, whether it favors my point of
view or not. Believing and teaching error can earn you the lake of
fire, so I have no agenda beyond ascertaining the truth. Tradition does
not have any value to me. Adventism has no value to me if it is not
teaching the truth. If Dr. Bacchiocchi has the truth, then it will
withstand all challenges, if he does not, it will not hold up under the
simplest challenge. I have presented a rather simple challenge, which
could be quickly picked apart and demolished by Dr. Bacchiocchi if it
were flawed. I think I have done my homework, enough to show Dr.
Bacchiocchi is in error.</p>

  <p>In newsletter <a

sources cited by Uriah Smith to support his identification of the
number 666 with the pope's title<i> Vicarius Filii Dei,</i> are the
accounts of two eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen the inscription
on the pope's tiara while in Rome. One claimed to have seen the
inscribed papal tiara in the Vatican Museum and the other witness
allegedly saw it during an Easter Mass celebrations. Both accounts are
discredited by the fact that papal tiaras are not displayed in the
Vatican Museum, nor does the pope wear the tiara for Mass celebrations.
The three-crowns gold Tiara has been used primarily for the coronation
of the pope-a practice that has been discontinued by the latest three
popes, John Paul I, John Paul II, and Benedict XVI.</font> <font

  </center>
  </div>
  <p align="left">Dr. Bacchiocchi seems unwilling to let his readers
know that Popes frequently wore the triple tiara <i>both to and from
Mass</i> at St. Peter's, as demonstrated by the above <a
 href="#documentation">documentation</a>. A visitor to St. Peter's on
Easter Sunday might easily remark that he had observed the Pope wearing
a tiara at Easter Mass, not taking into consideration that Mass
technically began only after the Pope removed his tiara, and that the
Mass technically ended before the Pope put the tiara on again. (The
triple tiara is a non-liturgical symbol of the Pope's temporal
authority over kings, and the papal mitre is a symbol of the Pope's
ecclesiastical authority, so only the mitre is worn during Mass.) So I
maintain that it is probable that Pope Gregory XVI <i>was</i> observed
wearing a tiara both before and after the Easter service of 1845, as
this was a common practice, as documented.</p>
  <p align="left">There are apparently at least <i>two</i> places
where the Vatican stores papal headgear, one is the <a
 href="http://www.stpetersbasilica.org/Interior/Sacristy-Treasury/Sacristy-Treasury.htm">Sacristy
&amp; Treasury Museum of St. Peter's</a>, and the other is the Papal
Sacristy of the Sistine Chapel, also known as the <font
 face="Times New Roman">room of the Copricapi, which is located behind
the altar and fresco of the Last Judgment.</font></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="left">Again Dr. Bacchiocchi dismisses an eye witness on a
technicality, not considering the sacristies a part of the Vatican
Museum proper. It is quite possible that a visitor to the Vatican
viewed tiaras in one of these sacristies and simply stated later that
the inscribed tiara was seen during a tour of the Vatican museum. </p>

  <p>I conclude that when Dr. Bacchiocchi states that there are no

claim there are no inscriptions on papal tiaras. Unless one has seen
every single item in question, it is foolish to make such assertions.
There have probably been <i> hundreds</i> of the cloth papal mitres,
which are liturgical hats worn during Mass, and there may well have
been one lettered with Vicarius Filii Dei.</p>
  <p>Dr. Bacchiocchi states<span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;"> "Incidentally, </span><i>Vicarius
Filii Dei </i> <span style="font-style: normal;">is NOT A NAME, but
one of the many TITLES ascribed to the pope." Since he has apparently
not even bothered to read my short analysis of the exegetical support
at the top of this page, his muddle on this point is, shall we say,
predictable. </span></p>

  <p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Notes On</b></font><b><font
 color="#000000" size="5"> Samuele Bacchiocchi's DVD on <br>
666, The Mark and Number of the Beast</font></b></p>
  <hr>
  <p align="left">I have viewed Dr. Bacchiocchi's recorded DVD
presentation on 666, as well as his PowerPoint file, and have the
following observations.</p>
  <p align="left">For PowerPoint slide #98, the accompanying notes
mention that Catholic critics point out that "the pope NEVER wears the
tiara for the celebration of special Masses", so Dr. Bacchiocchi
rejects the eyewitness testimony.&nbsp; Again, the above <a
 href="#documentation">documentation</a> shows that Popes frequently
wore a tiara both to and from celebrating Mass. So these Catholic
critics are telling a half truth that frankly is irrelevant to whether
or not a pope was observed wearing a tiara on Easter Sunday of 1845, or
any other day. Dr. Bacchiocchi presented nothing more substantial than
these Catholic critics to discredit the eyewitness testimony.</p>
  <p align="left"> <img src="vfd-tiara-sm.gif" align="left" border="0"
 height="227" hspace="8" width="156"></p>
  <p align="left">In his slides (1 hour and 6 minutes into DVD #1), Dr.
Bacchiocchi presents this image at left as if it is one of the
fraudulently doctored Adventist tiara images that the General
Conference emphatically rejected for publishing some 60 years ago
because they were misleading and deceptive. The fact is that though he
used it in <i>several</i> of his slides, even <i>after</i> branding
it as unethical, Dr. Bacchiocchi had absolutely no clue where it
originated from. I can say with certainty, that particular drawing is
no older than Nov. 28, 2002, because <u><i>I produced it</i></u>. I
found the original unlettered <i>drawing</i> on the internet, enlarged
it some, and then added the lettering to more-or-less match the eye
witness description, and posted it in my article on <a
 href="666.html">666</a> and that is likely where
he got it. This <i>drawing </i>is not deceptive, fraudulent or
unethical in any way, not as the doctored photo surely is. The drawing
serves a legitimate and ethical illustrative purpose, and obviously
could <i>never</i> be used to fraudulently prove such a tiara exists.
This is why Dr. Bacchiocchi continued to use it in the second DVD, even
after condemning its use in the first DVD. (I have since learned that
the original drawing, with the title all on the lower crown, appeared
in the 1897 and 1906 Review and Herald printing of Uriah Smith's <i>Daniel
and Revelation, </i>page 581, shown below.)</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="VFD-tiara.gif" border="0" height="263"
 width="365"></p>
  <p align="left">There are to my knowledge, at least 3 papal tiaras
that bear inscriptions, not two, as Dr. Bacchiocchi states. All three
have been displayed in a recent tour of U.S. museums. See <a
 href="claims.html">http://biblelight.net/claims.htm</a></p>
  <p align="left">Whether or not a tiara or mitre was ever inscribed
with Vicarius Filii Dei is not really relevant to the issue at hand.
Dr. Bacchiocchi adequately shows on the first DVD that the title is
genuinely historical, and therefore valid, it is simply not a
fabrication of any Protestants or Adventists. However, after proving it
genuine, he discards it in the second DVD as not applicable to
Revelation 13. So this whole debate really rests on how the number of
the name of the beast is interpreted and applied, and not on papal
tiaras or mitres. That brings us back to the exegetical support at the
beginning of this page, and no one has shown this interpretation to be
in error.</p>

"FROM A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN THE VATICAN MUSEUM." </font>First of all,
this is NOT a photograph, or even a doctored photograph, it is 100% an
artist's drawing, a drawing made "from a photograph" of a tiara. So why
not just publish the actual photo? Obviously the tiara in the photo <u>did
not</u> have the inscription. The artist had used a photo as a model
for his illustration of what an inscribed tiara would probably look
like, according to the eyewitness testimony. That said, however, the
drawing is apparently realistic enough to fool some people into
thinking they are seeing an actual photograph. The photo above on the
left of the <a href="gregory-xvi-tiara-sm.jpg">1834 tiara of Gregory
XVI</a>, taken by C. T. Everson in the Vatican Museum and published in
an article in 1905 (see below), bears no inscription. It is probably
the photo used as a model for the drawing.&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">Interestingly enough, Dr. Bacchiocchi did not show us
the above drawing in his presentation when discussing doctored photos,
he showed the following slide:</p>

say.</p>
  <p align="left">I also would like to highlight and contrast the
generally brilliant intellect and superior insight possessed by those
who agree with Dr. Bacchiocchi on this issue, and the dismally
irresponsible and blind dolts like myself who disagree, and are mired
