        <p align="left"><font size="3">Dr. Carroll,</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In considering the treatment of relapsed
heretics (most, but not all, heretics were given the chance to recant
before being burned alive), it is obviously important to consider the
underlining beliefs motivating such behavior on the part of the
Catholic secular and religious authorities.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">To those watching someone being burned alive,
as well as to the person being executed, it is clear that such a death
was a vivid depicture of people's beliefs regarding Hell. In Saint Joan
of Arc's Trial of Condemnation, Hell is not referred to as "hell" but
as the "eternal fire". The same terminology was later used at the
Council of Florence, and is also present in the current Catechism of
the Catholic Church (paragraph #1036).</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Does it seem logical that heretics were
burned alive, with their mental faculties intact, to give them one last
chance to repent before being sent into the "eternal fire"? Could it be
that burning an individual at the stake was seen as a merciful death,
as a means of giving that person one last chance to save his or her
soul before final damnation??? I have read that "burning at the stake
was believed by some medieval authorities and scholars to liberate the
sinner from his or her formerly damned state and offer some hope of
salvation to the now 'cleansed' soul".</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The unchanging teaching of the Church is that
Hell is the "the unquenchable fire" (#1034) and that it is eternal
(#1035). Until the 20th-century, heresy was viewed as a terrible sin,
something that the Apostle Paul condemns as damnable (#817), stating in
Galatians 1:6-9,</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">"I am astonished that you are so quickly
deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and turning to a
different gospel-- not that there is another gospel, but there are some
who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if
we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to
that which we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said
before, so now I say again, If any one is preaching to you a gospel
contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed." Some
translations have "eternally condemned" or "anathema" instead of
"accursed".</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Given such an admonition, what should one
have expected of the medieval Church? If heretics were (and are) on a
"highway to Hell", does it make sense to mercifully kill a relapsed
heretic, so that he or she can "peacefully" pass into the "furnace of
fire" (#1034)?</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In our time, we have religious freedom, a
gift from the deists of the Enlightenment. This is a good thing!! We
need religious tolerance. One only need look at the events of September
11 to see that!! Tolerance is good and wonderful! Without it, we would
probably be fighting numerous religious and ethnic wars, which would
cost millions of lives.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">In the end, though, our deep religious
tolerance may not be a good thing. In giving people the absolute
freedom to decide what they do or do not believe, we may have given
them the freedom to "think and feel" their way straight into Hell,
forever. In our age of complete relativism where there are no absolute
truths, the Church has to operate the best she can, and this means a
certain level of conformity to the prevailing social norms -- in this
case, religious tolerance and ecumenicalism.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">The world of medieval Catholic Europe
operated under a set of much different circumstances. They did what
they felt was right in the eyes of God. They were not "sinners" and did
not necessarily use "poor judgment". Ultimately, Christ will judge all
people, including those of the Inquisition. Catholics should not feel
"embarrassed" by that outcome. I am not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">This is not to say that burning people alive
was justified, even if the individual in question was a genuine heretic
who repeatedly refused to recant. I guess that any judgment would need
to be made on an individual case. We will all die someday, and I fully
and firmly believe that God will judge everyone to ultimately spend
eternity in either Heaven or Hell. From the perspective of an obstinate
heretic who was taken to the scaffold to be executed but who recanted
before dying, the Inquisition may have ultimately been a “good” thing,
assuming, of course, that the person went to Heaven who would have
otherwise gone to Hell, except for the “grace” of the Inquisition. Of
course, only God knows for sure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">If you think that the Inquisition was evil or
misguided, just consider the state of those countries today where the
Inquisitions were the most active – Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Nearly
everyone in those countries is Catholic, and consequently, all three of
those nations have the most restrictive abortion laws in the world.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Over the course of six hundred years, the
Catholic Inquisitions sent between forty to sixty thousand individuals
to the scaffold to be burned by the secular authorities. This is less
than half the number of abortions done in the United States every month.</font></p>

it wasn't a terrible idea. Kill a few heretics to save the eternal

my assumption. Thanks. </font></p>

horror the recent posts condoning the burning of heretics at the stake.
It seems that the conservative branch of the Church feels that the
Crusades, the Inquisition, et. al. were completely justified. The
Church is NEVER wrong, and if you EVER question what went on in those
years, I suppose you are branded a what, a heretic??
I do know in my historical studies that, without a doubt, there were
many corrupt practices taking place in the Church, and that some of the
so-called heretics were really just good people trying to make some
changes (such as letting the bible be translated into the language of
the people, to be read by the people). Would not these people who state
that it was the right of the Church to burn heretics say that modern
day "heretics" (Billy Graham, perhaps?) be equally condemned because
they are Protestant? I cannot believe that ANYONE who professes to be a
Christian would ever condone the torture and burning of heretics. I am
losing my faith in the Church if this is the case. </font></p>

        <p><font size="3">I have stated before my respect for your work
on this forum, and sincerely repeat it now. You defend doggedly and
with expert knowledge the truths of the Catholic faith.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">I join with all those who believe that no
justification for burning heretics can be found in the character and
teachings of Jesus Christ. The defense of staking that one poster
advanced at your forum --that it offers the terrified heretic one
final, merciful chance to repent before being cast into hell—will not
stand. That man on the stake was robbed forever, at the Pope’s orders,
of any chance for the heartfelt repentance that alone pleases God. No
confession of grave sin extracted from a man twisting in agony could
possibly bring satisfaction to Jesus Christ. We do not need to consult
the magisterium of the Catholic Church to know that this is so. Nor is
there any possibility that such a gruesome spectacle could elevate
public morality or restore men to a right relationship with God. The
Popes who approved this horrendous punishment dishonored God far more
than the heretics, and fueled the Reformation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3">You speak solemnly of the responsibility of
central authorities (as in Russia, Cuba, the U.S. government in 1861,
the Bishop of Rome throughout history) to resist revolutionaries,
drawing an analogy between dangerous political rebels and heretics. But
order and discipline are not always worthy of admiration. Life in
Russia under the Czars had little to recommend it. Would you have
wanted to be a serf? Concerning Cuba, would you deny that the
government of that island was corrupt to the core in the years before
Castro? Arguably, it still is, but there were powerful reasons for the
uprising that took place there. It is not in praise of Lenin and Marx
that men in free countries can still reject the rule of the Czars and
the sleek hoodlums who once ran Cuba with an iron fist. Common people
have a right to fight tyranny. Do you not see that a Pope who passes
beyond his supreme authority to identify and excommunicate heretics,
into the realm of BURNING THEM ALIVE, has departed from Christ and
taken on the mantle of a tyrant? </font></p>

  <p>Note that he says in the above post:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"<font size="3">I certainly do not advocate the restoration of
the butning [burning] of heretics, because in the present climate of
opinion it would hurt the Church, ... "</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, if the climate <i>were</i> different, and the Catholic Church
held the reigns of power over secular governments again, what could we
"heretics" that oppose apostate Catholic teaching expect??</p>
  <p>In August of 2002 <font size="3">Matthew Bunson replaced Dr.
Carroll in the EWTN History Forum. Note this defense of burning
heretics at the stake:</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="3">Why are we always apologizing
for the inquisitions? Why should Catholics feel bad that Exsurge Domine
condemned Luther for the error stating that the burning of heretics was
against the will of the Spirit?
I tire of self-righteous critics denouncing the Church on this. Let me
attempt a defence:</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">1) Temporal rulers and states have the
legitimate authority to administer capital punishment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">2) At the time of the inquisitions, the
states involved were explicitly, formally, officially *Catholic*
entities. Kings and emperors were crowned in religious ceremonies.
Because the Church rebuilt Europe, these kingdoms derived their
authority from the Church.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">3) A heretic was both a proliferator of
doctrinal error *and a social revolutionary*. To be a heretic meant one
was dedicated to overthrowing both the Church and the temporal order,
i.e., fomenting revolution.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">4) The Church executed no one. The Church's
main role was to determine if the accused was actually a heretic or
not. He or she was then turned over to the state - sometimes. The
state's official punishment for heresy was usually a death sentence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Hence, since a heretic was both a false
teacher and a social revolutionary, he threatened to unleash chaos in
society. I have no doubt that, given the rulers of the time (rulers
*God* allowed to be) that the will of the Spirit was to give the
heretic his just deserts (i.e., *justice*), meaning death at the stake.
This does not make God or the Catholic Church cruel or sadistic. Any
one who thinks this is cruel can simply review the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, when heresy triumphed. The tragedy in lives and
souls lost speaks for itself.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Lastly, the inquisitions were not only not
bad, but were good. Why? Because they were an advancement over the mob
violence and vigilante justice that proceeded them. Everything was
usually by the book, carried out by the due 'controlling legal
authorities'.
If a man was executed, you can at least be sure that the accusations
against him were true.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3">Where am I wrong in this? </font></p>

    <div align="center">
    <hr size="2" width="20%"></div>
    <big><br>
    </big>
    <div align="justify"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one is more honest
with Protestants than
we are, for no one knows them better. There is a great deal of
controversy now going on as to the attitude of Protestants towards
Catholics holding political office. We have published statements from
Baptist and Lutheran bodies, and individual declarations from prominent
men in all the Protestant sects. They are all agreed on the question.
They would not vote for a Catholic for political office, least of all
for the presidency of the United States; and they all give the same or
similar reasons. Some say it is because Catholics owe their allegiance
to the Pope, and therefore they cannot vote for them. Others declare
that all Catholics believe in the union of Church and State; and they
under no circumstances would vote to give them political power. Others
give other reasons; but one and all declare that they would not vote
for Catholics, and mostly all for the two reasons given above. </big><br>
    <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But is there not a reason behind these two
reasons
which these Protestants are not willing to admit even to
themselves?&nbsp; Are not these two reasons too theoretical and
entirely too academic for the majority of Protestants? They know very
little of the meaning and import of allegiance, civil or ecclesiastic;
and they do not know what Catholics understand by the term. They have a
very vague and indistinct notion of the union of Church and State, and
are not aware that such union exists more or less in every state in
Christendom. What they really oppose and what they wish to emphasize by
their vote is that they do want want to be dragooned into the Catholic
Church. They fear that if the Catholic Church should get the upper hand
in this country she might induce the state to suppress all heretical
worship and compel all to embrace the Catholic faith. And this fear is
not irrational, if unfounded. The Church has persecuted. Only a&nbsp;
tyro in church history will deny that. The Apologists in the days of
Roman imperial domination inveighed against persecution and with
Tertullian deplored that "it was no part of religion to persecute
religion." But after the days of Constantine and under the reign of
that first Christian emperor the attitude of Christians underwent a
change, and persecution of pagans took place in many places in the
empire. A hundred and fifty years after Constantine the Donatists were
persecuted and sometimes put to death. Against this extreme measure St.
Augustine raised his voice; but he was willing that they should
despoiled of their churches and of their goods. Protestants were
persecuted in France and and Spain with the full approval of the Church
authorities. We have always defended the superventions of the Huguenots
and the Spanish Inquisition. Wherever and whenever there is
honest&nbsp; Catholicity there will be a clear distinction drawn
between truth and error, and Catholicity and all forms of heresy. When
she thinks it good to use physical force the Church will use it. She is
no better nor holier than God; and God has used physical force to bring
people to embrace the truth. If the Church ever again finds herself in
the same circumstances as surrounded her in the days of the Donatists
and Huguenots and the Moriscoes it is very probable that she will
defend herself with the same weapons she used before. But will those
conditions ever return? We hope not for the sake of both persecutor and
persecuted. The Protestants of the world fear that the history of
persecution will repeat itself. If so it will be brought about by
themselves. They fear that they will be forced to embrace the Catholic
faith. They never will be as long as they allow Catholics to profess
their religion in peace. But if they want war they will be promptly
accommodated.</big><br>
    <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But will the Catholic Church give bond that
she will
not persecute at all? Will she guarantee absolute freedom and equality
of all churches and all faiths? The Catholic Church gives no bonds for
her good behavior. She has made mistakes in her policy which she
promptly corrected as soon as discovered. She has countenanced violence
when more human measures would have been of more avail. Her children
and her clergy have often been carried away by popular passion. But she
gives no bonds that such things shall not occur again.</big><br>
    <big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should the Church be required to
furnish
security of good behavior? Civil governments have been tyrannical. But
we must have civil government. The state has oppressed, and kings have
abused their power. But we must have the state to maintain order and
protect life and property. So it is with the Church; only more so. We
must have the Church. She is the means of grace to a lost world. She is
salvation to all mankind. Without the state we have anarchy; without
the Church we have spiritual chaos. &#8213;
