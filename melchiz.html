Did he celebrate the unbloody sacrifice of the Catholic Mass?</font></b></center>
<hr>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some Catholic apologists will point to the king and priest of Salem
  (Jerusalem) in the time of Abram, as proof that the Catholic mass is indeed a
  sacrifice:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Melchisedech, the king of Salem and a priest, offered sacrifice under the
    form of bread and wine (Gen 14:18). Psalm 110 [v. 4] predicted Christ would
    be a priest &quot;according to the order of Melchisedech&quot;, that is,
    offering a sacrifice in bread and wine. We must then, look for some
    sacrifice other than Calvary, since it was not under the form of bread and
    wine. The Mass fits the bill.</p>

  1988 by Ignatius Press, San Francisco, ISBN 0-89870-177-5, bearing the
  Imprimatur and Nihil Obstat of the Catholic Church, page 253.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 14:17 (KJV) And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his
    return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with
    him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.<br>
    Gen 14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
    was the priest of the most high God.<br>
    Gen 14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high
    God, possessor of heaven and earth:<br>
    Gen 14:20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
    enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now from the King James Bible, as quoted above, the Catholic claim is
  simply not apparent. Here is the same verse from the Catholic Douay Rheims
  Bible as revised in 1899 by Bishop Challoner:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Gen 14:18 But Melchisedech the king of Salem, bringing forth bread and
    wine, for he was the priest of the most high God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The essence of Keating's argument is that Melchisedech offered the bread
  and wine to Abram as a direct result of his role as a priest, as evident by
  the phrase &quot;for he was the priest&quot;, the role of the priest being to
  offer sacrifices. So by Keating's thinking, Melchisedech offered the
  &quot;sacrifice&quot; of the Catholic Mass to Abram. Keating dismisses even
  the possibility that Melchisedech was merely offering Abram a meal of bread
  and wine in celebration of his recent victory over king Chedorlaomer and his
  allies, but the text gives no indication of a formal worship ceremony of any
  kind. Keating, it would seem, is trying to assert that Melchisedech instituted
  the Lord's Supper with Abram, rather than Jesus with His disciples. Note the
  following similar incident that involved David and the priest Ahimelech:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Sam 21:2 (NIV) And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
    commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of
    the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I
    have appointed my servants to such and such a place.<br>
    1 Sam 21:3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
    bread in mine hand, or what there is present.<br>
    1 Sam 21:4 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
    under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept
    themselves at least from women.<br>
    1 Sam 21:5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
    women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and
    the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common,
    yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.<br>
    1 Sam 21:6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
    there but the showbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot
    bread in the day when it was taken away.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here David is actually given the consecrated Showbread by the priest, not
  because David wanted to have a communion service, nor was it the intent of the
  priest to conduct a &quot;sacrificial&quot; ceremony for David, but rather the
  bread was given because David and his men were hungry and it was the only food
  available.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mark 2:25 (NIV) He answered, &quot;Have you never read what David did
    when he and his companions were hungry and in need?<br>
    Mark 2:26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of
    God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat.
    And he also gave some to his companions.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is no reason to believe that Melchisedech was doing anything else
  than simply offering Abram food and drink, similar to that as happened with
  David and his men.</p>
  <p>As to Psalm 110:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Psa 110:1 (KJV) A Psalm of David. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at
    my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.<br>
    Psa 110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou
    in the midst of thine enemies.<br>
    Psa 110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
    beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy
    youth.<br>
    Psa 110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for
    ever after the order of Melchizedek.<br>
    Psa 110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day
    of his wrath.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Keating states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What is more, &quot;according to the order of Melchisedech&quot;
    (&quot;order&quot; not referring, of course, to the modern notion of a
    religious order, there being no such thing in Old Testament days.) The only
    &quot;manner&quot; shown by Melchisedech was the use of bread and wine. A
    priest sacrifices the items offered - that is the main task of all priests,
    in all cultures, at all times - so the bread and wine must have been what
    Melchisedech sacrificed. He did not bring these elements along just because
    he thought it might be time for Abraham's lunch. [pages 253-254]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What Keating overlooks here is that Melchisedech was both a priest <em>and</em>
  the king of Salem (Jerusalem), but he was not of the Levitical priesthood
  (Levi being a descendant of Abraham). <em>This</em> is the &quot;order of
  Melchisedech&quot; scripture refers to so frequently (See Hebrews 5:6, 10;
  6:20; 7:1:3, 11, 15, 17, 24, 28). Jesus is our High Priest, and the King of
  Kings, yet He was not of the tribe of Levi, but rather the tribe of Judah.</p>
  <p>A recent Catholic Bible commentary completely disagrees with Keating:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Recognizing Abraham's great deed - winning a victory that the five kings
    were not able to achieve - he [Melchizedech] sets a feast before Abraham to
    win the goodwill of so favored a personage.</p>
  </blockquote>

  copyrighted by Prentiss Hall, 1990 and 1968, ISBN 0-13-614934-0, bearing the
  Imprimatur and Nihil Obstat of the Catholic Church, page 21.</p>
  <p>Karl Keating and other Catholic apologists who appeal to Melchisedech to
  justify the Mass as a &quot;sacrifice&quot; are still a dogma in search of
  even the <em>slimmest</em> scriptural proof.</p>
