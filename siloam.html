  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p>2 Ki 18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh 
    from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they 
    went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and 
    stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the 
    fuller's field.</p>
    <p>2 Ki 20:20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and 
    how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they 
    not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
    <p>2 Chr 32:30 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of 
    Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. 
    And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</p>
    <p>Neh 3:15 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of 
    Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set 
    up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall 
    of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down 
    from the city of David.</p>
    <p>Isa 7:3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, 
    and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the 
    highway of the fuller's field;</p>
    <p>Isa 8:6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go 
    softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;<br>
    Isa 8:7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of 
    the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and 
    he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:</p>
    <p>Isa 22:9 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they 
    are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.<br>
    Isa 22:10 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have 
    ye broken down to fortify the wall.<br>
    Isa 22:11 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the 
    old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect 
    unto him that fashioned it long ago.</p>
    <p>Isa 36:2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem 
    unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the 
    upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field.</p>
    <p>John 9:7 And said unto him, <font color="#FF0000">Go, wash in the pool of Siloam</font>, (which is by 
    interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came 
    seeing.<br>
    John 9:8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that 
    he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?<br>
    John 9:9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I 
    am he.<br>
    John 9:10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?<br>
    John 9:11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and 
    anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: 
    and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>
