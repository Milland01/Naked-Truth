  <p align="center"><b>THE JESUITS CAPTURE THE COUNCIL OF TRENT </b></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Society of Jesus proposed to subordinate the Holy 
    Scriptures and in their place substitute the interpretations of the Bible by 
    the ecclesiastical writers of the first centuries whom they called the 
    “fathers.” All the errors and vagaries of the allegorizers who confused and 
    darkened the first three centuries were selected. The first great papal 
    council which assembled after the Reformation, the Council of Trent (A. D. 
    1545-1563), was dominated by the Jesuits. This assembly laid down the law, 
    and no papal authority has dared since to dispute it. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In assembling this church council, Emperor Charles V gave the 
    order that only the abuses in the church, not doctrine, should be 
    considered. He was distracted to behold his realm divided between two 
    contending churches, and it mattered little to him which creed prevailed. He 
    only wished some general assembly to remedy conditions. The emperor desired 
    Lutherans and Catholics to sit together in a general council, and he fondly 
    believed Europe again would be united. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The influence of the Jesuits was immediately seen when the 
    pope ignored the imperial command to notify the Reformers. Weeks passed, and 
    finally the council organized itself and accepted the following as its first 
    four decrees: (1) The Vulgate was the true Bible and not the Received Text 
    which the Reformers followed and which had been the Bible of the Greek 
    Church, the Church of the east, and the true churches of the West through 
    the centuries; (2) tradition was of equal authority with the Sacred 
    Scriptures; (3) the five disputed books found in the Catholic Bible, but 
    rejected by Protestant scholars, were declared canonical; (4) the priests 
    only, and not the laity, were capable of rightly interpreting the 
    Scriptures.<sup>7</sup> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the emperor learned that the Protestants had not been 
    called to the council, he was enraged. Uttering severe threats, he demanded 
    that his original plan be executed. Though the pope reluctantly and with 
    long delay obeyed, the decrees already passed irrevocably compromised the 
    situation. The Lutherans refused to accept the insulting notifications. In 
    the meantime the pope had died and his successor advocated Jesuit policies. 
    The deliberations proceeded as they had begun. Decree after 
    decree was proclaimed; doctrine after doctrine was settled. Repeatedly the 
    emperor was misled until he expressed his anger strongly to the Roman 
    pontiff over the deceitful maneuvering. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How were the church prelates to defend these doctrines which 
    had no scriptural authority? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hours, weeks, and months; yes, many sessions went by with 
    this anxious question in their hearts. Then, one morning, January 18, 1562, 
    the archbishop of Rheggio hurried from his room and appeared before his 
    confreres to proclaim that he had the answer. Protestants, he urgently 
    reasoned, never could defend Sunday sacredness,<sup>8</sup> If they 
    continued to offer as their authority “the Bible and the Bible only,” it was 
    clear that they had no Bible command for the first day of the week. 
    According to Pallavicini, papal champion of the council, the archbishop 
    said, “It is then evident that the church has power to change the 
    commandments,” because by its power alone and not by the preaching of Jesus 
    it had transferred the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.<sup>9</sup> 
    Tradition, they concluded, was not antiquity, but continuous inspiration. 
    None could continue to fight the acceptance of tradition when the only 
    authority for Sunday sacredness in the church was tradition. This discovery 
    nerved the council to go forward with its work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the doctrines against which the Reformers had protested 
    were thus again formulated and strengthened by Rome. All the rites and 
    practices which the Church in the Wilderness had straggled to escape were 
    incorporated more strongly than ever into papal tradition by the twenty-five 
    sessions of the council between 1545 and 1563. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henceforth, the Papacy was to have only one mission in the 
    world, namely, to command nations and men everywhere to submit to the 
    Council of Trent. The new slogan now invented, which must go reverberating 
    throughout the earth, was, “The Council of Trent, the Council of Trent, the 
    Council of Trent.”</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">[col. 529] Such is the condition of the heretics of this age 
    that on nothing do they rely more than that, under the pretense of the word 
    of God, they overthrow the authority of the church; as though the church, 
    His body, could be opposed to the word of Christ, or the head to the body. 
    On the contrary, the authority of the church, then, is illustrated most 
    clearly by the Scriptures; for while on the one hand she recommends them, 
    declares them to be divine, [col. 530] offers them to us to be read, in 
    doubtful matters explains them faithfully, and condemns whatever is contrary 
    to them; on the other hand, the legal precepts in the Scriptures taught by 
    the Lord have ceased by virtue of the same authority. The Sabbath, the most 
    glorious day in the law, has been changed into the Lord’s day. Circumcision, 
    enjoined upon Abraham and his seed under such threatening that he who had 
    not been circumcised would be destroyed from among his people, has been so 
    abrogated that the apostle asserts: &quot;If ye be circumcised, ye have fallen 
    from grace, and Christ shall profit you nothing.&quot; These and other similar 
    matters have not ceased by virtue of Christ’s teaching (for He says He has 
    come to fulfill the law, not to destroy it), but they have been changed by 
    the authority of the church. Indeed, if she should be removed (since there 
    must be heresies), who would set forth truth, and confound the obstinacy of 
    heretics? All things will be confused, and soon heresies condemned by her 
    authority will spring up again. [See No. 1444.]</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Council [of Trent] agreed fully with Ambrosius Pelargus, 
    that under no condition should the Protestants be allowed to triumph by 
    saying that the council had condemned the doctrine of the ancient church. 
    But this practice caused untold difficulty without being able to guarantee 
    certainty. For this business, indeed, ‘well-nigh divine prudence’ was 
    requisite—which the Spanish ambassador acknowledged as belonging to the 
    council on the sixteenth of March, 1562. Indeed, thus far they had not been 
    able to orient themselves to the interchanging, crisscrossing, labyrinthine, 
    twisting passages of an older and newer concept of tradition. But even in 
    this they were to succeed. Finally, at the last opening [see editors’ note] 
    on the eighteenth of January, 1562, all hesitation was set aside: [Gaspar de 
    Fosso] the Archbishop of Reggio made a speech [see No. 1443] in which he 
    openly declared that tradition stood above Scripture. The authority of the 
    church could therefore not be bound to the authority of the Scriptures, 
    because the church had changed circumcision into baptism, Sabbath into 
    Sunday, not by the command of Christ, but by its own authority. With this, 
    to be sure, the last illusion was destroyed, and it was declared that 
    tradition does not signify antiquity, but continual inspiration. </p>

    <p>[Editors’ note: This &quot;last opening&quot; of the Council of Trent was not the 
    last day, but the opening of the 17th session, the first meeting of the last 
    series of sessions that was opened, after a lapse of time, under a new pope. 
    The council was in session for longer or shorter periods over a series of 
    years.]</p>

Processione di tutto 'l Clero della città, de' Theologi, &amp; Prelati, che, oltrei 
Cardinali, erano cento dodici mitrati, accompagnati dalle famiglie loro, &amp;

Gasparo dal Fosso, Arcivescovo di Reggio, fece l'orazione: Hebbe per soggetto 
trattar dell'autorità della Chiesa, del Primato del Papa, &amp; della potestà de' 
concilii; disse l'autorità della Chiesa non esser minore di quella della parola 
di Dio; che la Chiesa ha mutato il Sabbato, da Dio già ordinato, nella Domenica, 
&amp; levata la Circoncisione, già strettamente dalla Maestà divina commandata; che 
questi precetti, non per la predicazione di Cristo, ma per autorità della Chiesa 
sono mutati. Rivoltosi anco a' Padri, gli conforto ad adoperarsi constantmete

<p>Therefore in conformity with the resolution, when the eighteenth day was 
come, a procession was made of the whole clergy of the city of the divines and 
prelates, who besides the cardinals were one hundred and twelve that wore the 
mitre, accompanied by their families and guarded by many of the country people 
armed, going from St. Peter's Church to the Cathedral; where the Cardinal of Mantoua sang the Mass of the Holy Ghost and Gasparo dal Fosso, 
Archbishop of Reggio, made the sermon: His subject was the authority of the 
Church, the primacy of the Pope, and the power of Councils: he said that the Church had 
as much authority as the word of God and that the Church had changed the sabbath 
ordained by God into Sunday, taking away the Circumcision formerly commanded by 
the divine Majesty, and that the precepts are changed, not by the preaching of 
Christ, but by the authority of the Church. Turning himself unto the fathers, he 
exhorted them to labour constantly against the Protestants, being assured, that, 
as the Holy Ghost could not err, so neither could they be deceived.</p>

    <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; January </i>18. which was 
    the Day appointed for the opening of the Council, all the Prelates, 
    to the number of 112. and those who had a Right to assist at the Council, 
    being assembled at St. Peter's Church, went from thence in Procession to<i>
    </i>the Cathedral; where the     Cardinal of <i>Mantua </i>Sang the 
    <i>Mass of </i>the Holy Ghost and <i>Gaspar del Fosso, </i>Archbishop of
    <i>Reggio, </i>Preached. He discoursed about 
    the Authority of the Church, and of Councils: He began with telling them, 
    That the Authority of the Church was not less than that of the Scriptures, 
    because it received it from God; so that <i>&quot;whoever hears it, hears God;
    </i>and <i>whoever despiseth it, despiseth God: </i>That the Church alone 
    has Power to distinguish Canonical Books from Apocryphal, Catholick from 
    Heretical; to interpret the Scriptures Faithfully, to reject whatsoever may 
    he hurtful, and to embrace what may be profitable: That this was the reason 
    of <i>St. Augustin's </i>saying, <i>I should not believe the Gospel, if I 
    were  not induced to it by the Authority of the Church: </i>That what they 
    called the Church, was the Assembly of the Faithful, and of Prelates, which 
    cannot err, because it is enlightened by the Holy Ghost; by Jesus Christ its 
    Head; and that whosoever does</p>
<p>pg. 188</p>
<p>not acquiesce in its Determinations, opposes Jesus 
    Christ himself, and ought to be esteemed as a Heathen Man and a Publican: 
    That those do not deserve to be heard, who would have the Determinations of 
    Councils examined over again, especially if they have been confirmed by the
    Holy See. That what has been once decided 
    concerning Matters of Faith in a Council, has 
    been never known to be resumed, but only things that relate to Manners and 
    Ceremonies, which may be changed according to the variety of Times and 
    Places: That we need not wonder that Hereticks should cry out so furiously 
    against the Authority of Councils, because there 'tis that they find 
    themselves Condemned: That if (which is impossible) they should find any
    Council favourable to their Errors, then only 
    they would acknowledge its Authority  and, That it is to no purpose for 
    them to pretend to use the Word of God, thereby to ruine the Authority of 
    the Church, as if the Church, which is the Body of Jesus Christ, could be 
    contrary to his Word, and the Head to its Body: That on the contrary, the 
    Authority of the Church borrows its Luster and Majesty from the Scriptures, 
    when it declares, That these Holy Books come from God, when it gives them to 
    be read, when it faithfully explains their Sense, when it condemns what is 
    contrary to the Doctrine which they contain, even then, when by this Authority 
    we see legal Ceremonies abolished, though commanded in Scripture by our Lord<i>;
    </i>the Lord's Day substituted in the room of the Sabbath, so famous in the 
    Law of God; Circumcision ordained to <i>Abraham </i>and his Race with 
    threatnings, so entirely done away, That St. <i>Paul </i>declares to the <i>
    Galatians, </i>That if they are Circumcised, they are faln from Grace, and 
    Jesus Christ profits them nothing: That yet all these Ceremonies and others 
    of the same sort, were not abolish'd by the Preaching of Jesus Christ, since 
    he came to fulfil the Law, and not to destroy it: And therefore, That this 
    change is wrought by the Authority of the Church<i>; </i>and, That if this 
    Authority were destroy'd, since Heresies must be, Truth could never be 
    discovered, nor the obstinacy of Hereticks be confounded; and Disorder and 
    Confusion would be quickly seen in Religion. Upon occasion of the Festival 
    of St. <i>Peter, </i>which was celebrated that Day in the Church, he spoke 
    of the Popes Supremacy; and ended with a Prayer to Jesus Christ, That he 
    would send the Holy Ghost to enlighten and conduct the Fathers of the
    Council.</p>

  <blockquote>

<p>Gaspard del Fosso, archbishop of Reggio, had chosen for his subject the 
authority of the Church and the power of councils. The bishops had the 
satisfaction of hearing it declared, as in the too famous sermon of Musso, that 
the Holy Spirit was about to speak by their mouth. And as for the Church's 
authority, &quot;Is it not it,&quot; said he, among other reasons, &quot;that substituted the 
Lord's day for the Sabbath, which was instituted by God himself? Did it not 
abolish circumcision, also instituted by God?&quot; Whence it must be concluded, 
little room as there was for such reasoning, not that the Church is equal to the 
Word of God, but that it is much superior. If this were the place to reply, we 
might observe further, that the Sabbath and circumcision were practices, not 
doctrines; that these practices have been not abolished, but replaced, the one 
by the Lord's day, the other by baptism; that this substitution was the work of 
the Apostles; that, were it even the Church's doing, the right of modifying 
practices by no means draws along with it that of teaching new doctrines. Did 
the abolition of the Sabbath, and of circumcision, date as so many Romanist 
ideas do, from the tenth, nay, the twelfth century, should we be bound to 
subscribe to it? How prove the authority of the Church by decisions which we 
should be authorized to reject, did they emanate only from the Church? The 
argument, nevertheless, is in great favour, down to our own days even, in the 
writings of Romanist controversialists.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 8:00 A.M. on the morning of 18 January, 1562, the 
  four conciliar legates Gonzaga, Seripando, Hosius, and Simonetta, together 
  with Ludovico Madruzzo, Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga of Mantua, and the patriarchs, 
  archbishops, bishops, abbots, generals of the Orders, and many others 
  assembled in the church of S. Pietro in the eastern German quarter of the 
  city. From S. Pietro's [San Pietro degli Orbi] they went in procession to the cathedral [San Vigilio], where 
  Cardinal Gonzaga began the proceedings by singing the solemn mass of the Holy 
  Spirit. The indulgence was proclaimed, and Gasparo dal Fosso, archbishop of 
  Reggio di Calabria, delivered the sermon, of which Massarelli* has preserved 
  the text.</p>
