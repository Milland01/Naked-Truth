  <p align="center">I.<br>
  <strong>WHY PREACH AGAINST ROME?</strong><br>
  (Rev. 17:3-6,18.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Please give special attention to the first statement I shall make, and bear
  it in mind throughout this series of lectures. I believe there have always
  been good people in the Roman Catholic Church, and that there are multitudes
  of good people in that church to-day — people who have lived, and are
  living, up to their light. And all such, from my viewpoint, are the Lord's
  children. I recall an old lady who was once a neighbor of ours. She was a
  devout Catholic. Nevertheless, hers was a life of sacrifice for others. And
  although we were Protestants and I was a Protestant minister, when trouble
  assailed our home she was the most helpful of all our friends. Some years ago
  she passed into the great beyond, and I'm confident she went to heaven without
  having to</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 16] take in the sights of purgatory. [Laughter.]</p>
  <p>But while I believe there are Christian Catholics, I further believe —
  and shall prove — that they are the most deplorably hoodwinked people on the
  earth. [Applause].</p>
  <p>Therefore, I am not here to speak against Roman Catholics, but against
  Roman Catholicism — the widest spread, most arrogant, and diabolical system
  of evil that touches the lives of nations.</p>
  <p>And now, for a few moments, I shall preface the succeeding lectures of the
  series — each of which will be carefully and accurately loaded with
  rifle-balls, scooped out of the red-hot molds of history, the testimony of
  reputable ex-Catholics, and information on the surface of current events
  throughout the world — information so patent that the man in the greatest
  haste may read as he runs.</p>
  <p>Next Sunday evening the subject will be &quot;Popedom&quot; — the most
  palpable fraud of human history. If you are acquainted with the history of
  Romanism, it will</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 17] not be difficult for you to anticipate the substance of this
  discourse. If you are not, you will go away utterly astounded at the fallacy
  of Papal infallibility.</p>
  <p>The third lecture will be on &quot;The Priesthood&quot; — an eye-opener
  to all who have not familiarized themselves with the subject.</p>
  <p>The fourth will deal with the &quot;Auricular Confession: — an iniquity
  that, as I shall prove, ought to be prohibited by law.</p>
  <p>Fifth, &quot;Rome's Bloody Hands&quot; — and I shall substantiate the
  circular announcement that no man-eating tiger ever thirsted for human blood
  as has the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
  <p>Sixth, &quot;Romanism and American Institutions.&quot; If you are at all
  informed as to Rome's present attitude and movements in our country, the
  subject itself should set your nerves a-tingle and enlist your patriotism in
  the great fight that is on.</p>
  <p>And the last will be &quot;The Protestantism of Our Day and Its Relations
  to Roman Catholicism,&quot; or &quot;The Remedy.&quot;</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 18] Whether the text I read awhile ago be interpreted as a specific
  arraignment of the Catholic Church or given a more general interpretation, the
  striking similarity between the scarlet woman it describes and Romanism
  affords a recognizable picture of this iniquitous system.</p>
  <p>There are people in every community, with more sentiment than information
  and foresight, who lift up hands of horror and exclaim&quot; &quot;Sh! Don't
  say anything against Roman Catholicism! We don't believe in preaching against
  other people's religion!&quot;</p>
  <p>Now, let us shake this namby-pamby proposition and see what falls out of
  it.</p>
  <p>In the first place, Roman Catholicism is not a religion. It is to-day what
  it has been for more than thirteen centuries — a combination of Judaism and
  paganism with a little Christian sentiment mixed in. To be more exact, it is a
  gigantic political institution, and its ceremonies and benevolences are only
  screens that shield its hypocrisy from the public. It is the filthiest pit
  into which the world</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 19] has ever looked, the blackest and most nauseating veil ever
  wrapped about the heads of nations, the most dangerous foe humanity has. If
  hell has headquarters on earth, I'll prove to you, before these lectures are
  finished, that the devil's chief throne is in the city of Rome. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>In the second place, while many wishy-washy Protestants are very gracious
  and tender toward Romanism, Romanism has no more use for Protestantism than a
  rattlesnake has for a stone on its head.</p>
  <p>Now and then, a prominent priest, bishop, or cardinal administers
  Protestantism a soothing pellet in the form of a blessing upon the spirit of
  Christian union that is abroad in the world. But Protestantism and Romanism
  can no more unite than can powder and fire. [Applause.] A current illustration
  informs us that Romanism is a lion and Protestantism is a lamb. Romanism is
  perfectly willing for the lamb and the lion to lie down together. But Romanism
  wants the lamb to lie down in the</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 20] lion [Laughter.] This, like all bald headed, gray-whiskered
  illustrations [laughter], is out of date, and I would like to change it a
  little. Protestantism is no longer a lamb — it is a sheep, with a temper and
  horns. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>Rome is exerting herself to prohibit the passage of anticatholic literature
  through the mails. At this very hour she is trying to get a bill through
  Congress that would, should it become law, shield her abominations from the
  keen public eye. And she is constantly endeavoring to silence public
  discussion concerning her institutions and her attitude toward the affairs of
  the world. In other words, she is pushed into a corner and crying
  &quot;Persecution!&quot; If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. The
  idea of this blood-stained, history-cursed church, with the reeking scalps of
  more than fifty million victims swinging from her girdle, appealing to public
  sympathy and saying, &quot;Come and help me, I'm being persecuted!&quot; is
  ridiculous in the extreme. [Applause.] Returning to the illustration, the lion
  has forgotten</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 21] that he can roar, and is whining like a cat. [Applause.] Why? The
  sheep is getting busy. [Applause.] And the sheep will continue the exercise of
  its prerogative until the lion, no longer able to crouch on the fence and mew,
  will be butted over out of the field and into purgatory. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>Does Romanism preach against Protestantism? Be not deceived by a pretended
  friendliness for Protestantism upon the part of Romanism when, now and then, a
  priest or bishop condescends to sit on a popular platform with Protestants or
  indorses a limelight movement led by Protestants. Rome always has an ax to
  grind, nor does she hesitate to go out of her way and greet Protestants with a
  cordial smile when then are turning a good grindstone.</p>
  <p>In Stephen Keenan's &quot;Controversial Catechism,&quot; which is used in
  the Roman churches and taught in the parochial schools, it is stated, again
  and again, that no Protestant will be saved.</p>
  <p>In Deharbe's &quot;Catechism,&quot; and numerous other current Catholic
  works,</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 22] daily taught adults and children, the same position is
  dogmatically and offensively maintained.</p>
  <p>In &quot;Plain Talk about Protestantism of To-day,&quot; Segur says:
  &quot;Protestantism is not a religion, but a rebellion, a cancer, and the
  arch-enemy of souls.&quot;</p>
  <p>In Baddelley's book we read the soothing statement that &quot;the
  Protestant church, instead of leading them to heaven, infallibly leads them to
  hell&quot;: while the infallible throne of Romanism, which, according to
  Catholic teaching, can neither err, nor change, emphatically declares, through
  Pius IX., that &quot;the apostolic Roman Church is the one Ark of Salvation;
  that he who has not entered it will perish in the deluge; and that the
  Catholic religion, with all of its votes, ought to be exclusively dominant in
  such sort that every other worship should be banished and interdicted.&quot;</p>
  <p>Read any of the Catholic doctrinal books or periodicals, and you will
  discover that Romanism is constantly preaching against Protestantism in most
  unmistakable and insulting terms.</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 23] Throughout America, the Roman Church constantly and persistently
  teaches that no marriage is legal unless it is performed by a Catholic priest.
  To make it perfectly clear, while some of you are charitable enough to say,
  &quot;Let the Catholic Church alone — it is doing good work,&quot; Romanism
  declares from the housetops that you married people are living in iniquity,
  and it brands your children with the hot iron of disgrace.</p>
  <p>Ladies and gentlemen, from the beginning of the Reformation until now,
  Romanism has been what it always intends to be — the one open and
  above-board, avowed, never-sleeping, cursing, raving, hard-handed, no
  quarter-giving, insulting enemy of Protestantism. And if for no other reasons,
  our religion — baptized in the righteous blood of millions — and our
  marriage alter — the tenderest and fairest flower among our American
  institutions — should open wide the mouth of every non-Catholic in the
  country and direct his voice, long and loud, and like the clear tones of a
  trumpet, against the Vatican. [Applause.]</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 24] But there are other reasons!</p>
  <p>Romanism is the greatest of all obstacles in the path of Foreign Missions.
  Jesus said: &quot;Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel unto every
  creature.&quot; Every Protestant communion of any standing is represented on
  the foreign field, and, there, our missionaries are united — all are
  exalting Christ, and him only. But the Catholic Church is a menace to the
  foreign fields as well as the home lands. From every country come the same
  black report. In the Philippine Islands and all other fields, Romanism, while
  pretending to teach the Christian religion, is pushing its own selfish aims
  and hindering the gospel message.</p>
  <p>In the Congo Free State, Belgium's fiendish king tortured and maimed and
  slew multitudes of heathen men and women and children for gain; and the
  Catholic missionaries did all they could to keep the lid down, that the world
  might not look upon the terror and hear the groans of a downtrodden people who
  were compelled to spend their days</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 25] in a living hell. And when the old, rum soaked, licentious,
  avaricious, murderous king died, hopes were entertained and expressed for the
  repose of his soul. The repose of his soul? If I thought Leopold was in
  heaven, my ticket would be bought for the next station. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>Also, as the fruit of Roman teaching in Africa, Stephen J. Corey, in his
  book, states that, during his recent tour of Africa, he and his party were
  thrice assailed in one single day by native Catholics.</p>
  <p>But back to America. Romanism, which has never had a religious or moral
  conscious anywhere, has not the semblance of a political conscience in our
  country.</p>
  <p>In the majority of the Southern cities, and a few Northern cities, the Pope
  is a Democrat, but elsewhere he is a Republican. Be it remembered that the
  Catholic Church is one system, of which the Pope is the universally recognized
  head. He is, therefore, a multiplex being, and every loyal Catholic in the
  world is the Pope in reality and</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 26] action. He is the heart of Romanism.</p>
  <p>I've lived in two Democratic ring-ridden cities — Columbus and one other.
  [Applause.] And in each the Catholics are Democrats. I've lived in a
  Republican ring-ruled city, also and there the Catholics are Republicans. In
  all these cities I've witnessed reform campaigns, but the reform ticket have
  not had the Catholic support.</p>
  <p>When the political tricksters celebrate an election victory with a blowout,
  and make the night hideous with &quot;Hail! Hail! The Gang's all here!&quot;
  Rome always sings soprano. [Laughter.]</p>
  <p>Go where you may, and you will find Romanism with its arms around rum,
  vice, and rotten politics. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>Rome secures representation on temperance platforms. Yet her priests are
  intemperate, as I shall prove in the third lecture; some of her church papers
  carry liquor advertisements, and her sons keep saloons. The rum traffic will
  eventually go out of business. But before the sunlight of that glad day bursts
  in splendor upon all the mountains, hills, and plains</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 27] of America, Rome's political backbone will have to be broken.
  [Applause.]</p>
  <p>To sum it up: Roman Catholicism should be preached against because it is a
  fraud religiously, and a vampire politically; because it is opposed to a free
  press, free speech, and especially the free school; because, as history and
  current events prove, it never elevates, but always degrades the countries and
  communities it dominates; because it is the open and eternal foe of the Bible
  in the hands of the people; because it is Satan's right hand on earth to-day,
  with which he blights the lives of men, women, and children by the million,
  and seeks to ultimately snatch the Sun of righteousness from His noonday
  throne and wrap this old world in utter and hopeless darkness. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>But the truth is marching on. Protestantism is awakening from its sleep.
  Preachers are beginning to raise their voices against this mighty evil.
  Lecturers are shooting at it from the platform. Independent papers, that
  enlighten and stir the public conscience, are sing-</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 28] ing like swift arrows as they speed across the land and sea. And
  the printing press is binding paper by the ton into books and pamphlets that,
  finding their way into unnumbered homes, are opening the eyes of the people
  and preparing them for the most strenuous conflict of history. The time is not
  far distant when every Protestant minister in America will have to preach
  against Romanism or lose his job. [Applause.]</p>
  <p>I hear the distant rumble of thunder — it is the steady voice of God
  approaching. I see a flash of lightning against the sky-line — it is a gleam
  from the countenance of the oncoming, conquering King. The heavens will,
  erelong, be covered with a whirling blackness, the righteous indignation of a
  long-outraged and thoroughly aroused public — it will be the wrath of the
  Almighty. Truth will flash, back and forth, like forked lightning, and,
  assembling itself into one mighty dart, it will descend from the swirling
  blackness, strike the &quot;scarlet woman,&quot; and bury her so completely in
  the depths of purgatory that all the</p>
  <hr align="center" size="1" width="30%">
  <p>[pg. 29] prayers of priests, prelates, and popes ever uttered, written, or
  thought will never pry her out. And she shall be wrapped in a flame so great
  and so fierce that, although all the holy water ever manufactured be dashed
  upon it, it will never be quenched. [Applause.]</p>
